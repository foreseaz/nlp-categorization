You now know how to solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze solutions; and you have a wealth of tools (like data structures) at your disposal.  You may now be ready for an internship or (possibly) an entry-level software engineering job.  But can you land the internship/job?  It depends in part on how well you can solve new technical problems and communicate during interviews.  How can you get better at this?  Practice!  \n\nWith the support of Google’s recruiting and engineering teams we’ve provided tips, examples, and practice opportunities in this course that may help you with a number of tech companies.  We’ll assist you to organize into teams to practice.  Lastly, we’ll give you basic job search advice, and tips for succeeding once you’re on the job.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome &amp; What is a Software Engineering Interview?Welcome to our course on effectively communicating your technical abilities.  This course focuses on landing a technical job and excelling in a technical role.  To succeed in job interviews, you’ll need to be able to confidently articulate your ability to solve challenging problems and come up with new solutions under potentially stressful conditions. After getting a technical job, the role of communications increases.  You’ll need to work with other members of the team, communicate technical challenges and successes, and potentially sell the value of your work to those outside the company. Our goal is that by the end of this course each and every one of you understands the importance of technical communication, and has received constructive feedback on areas of potential improvement.  In achieving this goal you will also learn about algorithmic thinking on the fly, how to evaluate a good interview answer to a difficult technical problem, and how “soft” skills impact interview outcomes.   In this module, we’ll begin to see what a technical interview looks like, from the perspective of a major tech company.  We’ll then focus on how to best get the interview in the first place.Live coding: the technical phone interview and beyondNow that you’ve gotten warmed up, it’s time to practice your coding skills.  One of the things you’ll almost certainly be asked to do during a technical phone interview is to code up a solution to a problem in a shared text document (e.g. Google doc) while you are on the phone with the interviewer.  This experience can be intimidating, unfamiliar and humbling if you are not prepared, so this week we will give you lots of practice and tips for getting through this part of the interview with flying colors.  Explaining what you've already doneThis week, we’re going to focus on how to speak about your experiences working on projects and how to speak about the technical problems you’ve experienced and how you’ve solved those problems.  We’ll introduce the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) model for presenting your work, and discuss how to and how not to present the problem you worked on and the solution you developed.  We’ll also discuss the communication skills that are critical to this task.  It’s a fun week with lots of examples (both good and bad), which ends with an assignment where you will present your own work on video and submit this video for peer review.Algorithmic thinking on the flyAs we saw in week 2, coding on the fly can be a difficult task!  In this final week of the course we’ll revisit the skill of live problem solving by looking at how to solve more challenging algorithmic problems (and write the code associated with the solution) on the whiteboard.  You’ll recognize these problems as “classic” interview problems you’ve probably heard a lot about, designed to test your problem solving skills as well as your analysis and coding abilities.  Don’t worry, we’ll teach you how to approach them with confidence through a 6-step process to addressing technical questions (hint: you don’t have to produce the perfect solution on the first try!).  We’ll show you how to use this process in a number of examples.  But of course, there is no substitute for practice, so we’ll set you up with how to train and evaluate yourself.\n                                    ",

Las diferentes técnicas microscópicas nos ayudan a entender el reino atómico y la estructura de los organismos vivos, así como también de los diversos materiales. Es una herramienta imprescindible para desarrollar nuevas funcionalidades en el campo de la nanociencia y la nanotecnología con aplicaciones biomédicas, en computación y telecomunicaciones, y en energías renovables, entre otras muchas.\n\nAl completar el curso los estudiantes tendrán una visión detallada de los elementos básicos del que están formados los microscopios que utilizamos en las diferentes técnicas, su funcionamiento y operatividad, la preparación de muestras así como los objetivos y resultados de estudio.\n\nEl curso está pensado para profesores de secundaria que quieran tener una aproximación a las técnicas de microscopía así como para estudiantes tanto de secundaria como de primeros cursos universitários. Pero es apto para cualquier persona interesada en el mundo nanométrico y sus aplicaciones.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        INTRODUCCIÓN AL MICROSCOPIO  ELECTRÓNICO Te damos la bienvenida al curso de microscopia para la caracterización, en este curso el estudiante aprenderá  las partes esenciales y el funcionamiento de los diversos microscopios y técnicas de medida relacionadas,  así como las diversas aplicaciones. El curso está diseñado para desarrollarse a lo largo de 5 semanas, con una dedicación de 3 horas semana. Al finalizar cada módulo el alumno encontrará un cuestionario el cual deberá aprobar con un 80% de puntuación para la obtención de un certificado de aprovechamiento.Módulo 1: Microscopía Electrónica de Barrido (SEM)En este módulo se pretende mostrar la estructura y los principios básicos de funcionamiento del Microscopio Electrónico de Barrido (MEB o SEM en su acrónimo en inglés). Veremos qué tipo de fenómenos se producen dentro del microscopio al interaccionar el haz de electrones con la muestra y de qué manera se aprovechan las diferentes señales generadas para proporcionar, con gran resolución,  información morfológica, topográfica y de composición, siendo muy útil para una gran variedad de aplicaciones científicas y industriales.Módulo 2: Microscopía Electrónica de Transmisión (TEM)En este módulo se presenta la configuración de un microscopio electrónico de transmisión (TEM). Mientras en un microscopio SEM, las imágenes se forman con electrones secundarios arrancados de la muestra, o con electrones del haz primario que han sido retrodispersados al interaccionar fuertemente con los átomos del material, en un TEM las imágenes se forman con los electrones que han atravesado la muestra. Veremos los modos más fundamentales de operación para obtener una imagen ampliada de la muestra, incluso con resolución atómica, o para obtener diagramas de difracción de electrones que contienen información sobre la estructura cristalina de los materiales observados. Módulo 3: Microscopía Electrónica de Transmisión de Barrido (STEM)En este módulo presentamos el microscopio electrónico de transmisión y los modos de operación básicos con haz paralelo para obtener imágenes y patrones de difracción de electrones. En este tercer módulo, se presenta la posibilidad de trabajar con un haz convergente y de pequeño tamaño, que además barre la superficie de la muestra por la acción de bobinas electromagnéticas deflectoras, dando lugar al llamado modo de barrido – transmisión (STEM). La señal de interés en este caso, proviene de la interacción quasi-elástica de los electrones con los núcleos de los átomos de la muestra para obtener imágenes cuyo contraste depende del número atómico de los mismos, o bien de la interacción inelástica con la nube electrónica de los átomos de la muestra, para medir la pérdida de energía que ha sufrido el haz de electrones primario y extraer información sobre la composición del material y el estado de oxidación de los elementos que lo componen.Módulo 4: Microscopía de Fuerzas Atómicas (AFM)En este módulo analizamos el Microscopio de Fuerzas Atómicas que significó un hito a principios de los 80 para la evolución y consolidación de la nanotecnología ya que permite la medida de todo tipo de nanoestructuras de una forma rápida, sencilla y no destructiva. Durante el curso veremos su esquema y funcionamiento y podremos comprobar su gran potencialidad y alta versatilidad. El objetivo principal del curso es dar las herramientas básicas para la utilización práctica de un AFM de manera autosuficiente. Módulo 5: Microscopía Óptica Avanzada (MOA)En este módulo hablamos del gran avance que la Microscopía óptica ha experimentado en los últimos, consolidado con los nuevos equipos de Microscopía Óptica Avanzada que ya son capaces de trabajar en la nanoescala. Uno de estos equipos es el microscopio Confocal, el cual será presentado y explicado durante el curso para saber su esquema, composición, funcionamiento y posibles opciones de uso. La microscopía confocal permite la medición topográfica de superficies con una amplia gama de texturas (desde superficies muy rugosas a superficies muy lisas) mediante el escaneo en pasos de la muestra verticalmente.\n                                    ",

In this course we will study some of the world’s most beloved pictures guided by expert curators and art historians who step outside of the square, bringing a gendered reading to the masterpieces contained in the magnificent collections that we have been lucky enough to bring to the Coursera platform.  In this course you will learn how: \n\n* Gender and sexuality is an integral part of the production and reception of works of art\n* To increase your understanding of paintings through theories of gender and sexuality\n* To understand key terms from gender-related theories of art history and museology\n* To recognise the operation of what is termed ‘the gaze’ and how it works in relation to paintings\n* Ideas about gender and sexuality can productively be employed in theorising art curatorial practices\n* To take the initiative in relating theoretical ideas about gender and sexuality to the reading and display of art and visual cultures.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Tiepolo’s CleopatraWe begin this MOOC by introducing you to some of the theories about gender and sexuality that we will be calling upon throughout this course. We will look at the tradition of the representation of women in art and the operation of the 'male gaze', which renders most female subjects passive in pictures. We will focus, in this unit, on an unusual exception to this tradition, Tiepolo's Banquet of Cleopatra at the National Gallery of Victoria, in which we see Cleopatra depicted as a powerful regent. How does Tiepolo break the rules in this painting, emphasising Cleopatra’s agency? How did Tiepolo’s facility with paint work to produce this gendered narrative? And who exactly was Cleopatra?The Culture of Sensibility and the ‘Man of Feeling’This week we examine in detail Thomas Gainsborough’s much loved Portrait of an officer of the Fourth Regiment of Foot, the portrait of Richard St George Mansergh-St George in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Here we consider how Gainsborough produced his portrait of the young soldier through the ideals associated with the culture of sensibility, so much a part of late eighteenth century ruling class culture. How is the concept of the ‘man of feeling’ utilised in Gainsborough’s enigmatic portrait? What is the relevance of Gainsborough’s focus upon the soldier’s hound? What does the picture tell us about masculinity and the way the culture of sensibility was gendered in eighteenth century Britain?Gainsborough at the HuntingtonWe consider five pictures by Thomas Gainsborough in week three of this course that are held in the collection of the Huntington Gallery in California, through an explication of how the artist represented his subjects in the context of the culture of sensibility. Beginning with Gainsborough’s painting of Karl Friedrich Abel, we consider how the artist produced his portrait of masculinity through references to music, science and the senses. We then move to Gainsborough’s pendant portraits of Lord and Lady Ligonier, and The Blue Boy, focussing upon boundaries of gender and sexuality, including debates around effeminacy and passion between the sexes. We conclude with the Huntington’s Cottage Door, considering how this staged scene calls the viewer to look with charity upon impoverished rural women and their children. Sexual Codes in Eighteenth Century French Courtly PaintingThis week Jennifer Milam, Professor of Art History at the University of Sydney, reveals the sexual codes and symbols of art in eighteenth century French painting. Professor Milam uncovers the erotic references imbedded in the courtly art of François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Two pastoral paintings by François Boucher form the centrepiece of this discussion of the playful and provocative representation of gender in the Ancien Régime. In addition, Professor Milam provides an in depth account of how these codes operated in some famous prints and drawings of the period. Orientalism, Gender and Display - Painting in MoroccoThis week Dr Caroline Wallace and I present a study of two artists working in Morocco in the early twentieth century; the British Royal Academy painter John Lavery and the Australian modernist Hilda Rix Nicholas. They examine how these artists used orientalist conventions to represent a European point of view of life in Morocco. In this unit we consider how colonialism, orientalism and gender relate to each other, impacting upon academic and modernist art in a variety of ways that are not immediately apparent. We discuss how orientalist art is gendered, investigating why Rix Nicholas’ practice has been described as counter-orientalist. Henri Rousseau: Challenging the Myth of the Passive WomanThis week Professor Barbara Creed explores the way Henri Rousseau challenged the myth of the passive woman and relocates women as a vital source of creativity and mystery in art. In The Dream woman is represented as the new Eve living in harmony with nature in a jungle paradise, while in The Sleeping Gypsy woman is on an inner journey into the realms of the unconscious. Professor Creed explores the spiritual dimensions of this painting and offers a new and exciting interpretation of its historical significance. Henri Matisse, Paul Cezanne and Max Dupain - Modernism, Gender and the Science of MovementScientific advances in the nineteenth and early twentieth century created new ideas about male and female bodies. In a unique reading of Henri Matisse's Dance and Paul Cezanne's The Bather, we consider how Darwinian theory and science impacted upon the work of these French modernists and how modernism itself undercut erotic codes in art. Dr Isobel Crombie, Senior Curator of Photography at the National Gallery of Victoria, interprets the representation of gender in the work of the Australian photographer Max Dupain as an expression of the twentieth century movement of vitalism. Frida Kahlo, Glyn Philpot and the Struggle to PaintThis week we begin by looking at Frida Kahlo’s Fulang-Chang and I as well as her Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair Canvas. These lectures on Frida Kahlo's pictures at MOMA finish with a discussion between myself and Redmond Barry Distinguished Professor Barbara Creed in which we consider WJT Mitchell 's famous question 'what do pictures want? This is followed by a video on Glyn Philpot’s Oedipus presented by Dr Ted Gott, Senior Curator of International Art at the National Gallery of Victoria.What is Women’s Business? Indigenous Art and the DreamingNational Gallery of Victoria Senior Curator of Indigenous Art, Judith Ryan, takes us deep into the Dreaming of the Australian Indigenous tradition. She examines in detail the making of two masterpieces by women artists from the Australian outback; Emily Kam Kngwarray's Big Yam Dreaming and Martumili artists’ Ngayartu Kujarra. In this unit we look at these iconic works in the context of ‘women's business’ and the gendered stories of indigenous Australia.\n                                    ",

This new story locates business within a societal framework. Almost every business creates or destroys value for customers, suppliers, employees, communities and society, in addition to shareholders and other financiers. A number of new models of business can be built on this idea such as corporate responsibility, philanthropy, shared value and sustainability. Profits and stakeholder value go together, and this course explains how.

You will learn how your objectives and those of your customer/client can be achieved in an effective way, to minimise possible threats or failures.\n\nThe course covers three key themes\n\nRelationship fundamentals: we will explore what can go right or wrong in relationships; examine the rules that govern public and private sector procurement; and ask how you can make sure what you buy (or sell) is what you and your customer/client really needs.\n\nRelationship complexities: we will look at the complex supply chains and networks that are a feature of many contracts, learning how to manage interdependencies and the needs of multiple stakeholders.\n\nWhat does this mean to you? The final part of the course will bring the above ideas together, using an example scenario (the challenge of building your own house) to put theory into practice.\n\nLearn with expert academics and experienced practitioners\n\nYour guides for the course are Douglas Macbeth, Professor of Purchasing and Supply Chain Management at the University of Southampton; and Tim Cummins, CEO of IACCM who has wide and senior management experience in the field.\n\nEach week, you’ll get the chance to hear guest lectures from, and discuss your own ideas with, practitioners from public and private sector organisations around the world.\n\n(Course image: derivative work based on silhouettes © Nevena Radonja/Shutterstock.)\n\n\n                                    ",

Participants will learn from practitioners, government officials, and academics with field experience, hearing firsthand about the opportunities and challenges of procuring and maintaining infrastructure services through effective PPPs.\n\n\n\nThe course includes video lectures, readings, quizzes and other learning materials designed and taught by experts from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the Indian School of Business, the European Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), among other institutions.\n\n\n\nWhether you are a member of the general public, a practitioner, or a policy maker, there is something in this course for you.\n \n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nOverview \nThis overview presents the main topics the course will include: \n\nWeek 1: Reducing the Infrastructure Service Gap: The Role of PPPs\n \nThis first module introduces how and why private sector expertise and resources should be considered by governments to assist in addressing the infrastructure gap.  In particular, it explains the importance of infrastructure to economic growth, the gap between the demand and existing supply for infrastructure services, and the challenges that governments have in addressing this gap. \n\n\nThe module presents the PPP concept, its defining features, and the types of contractual arrangements, which reflect the extent of the private sector’s participation. Not all arrangements between a public and private party are PPPs and explanations of what is not a PPP are also provided. Examples of successful and failed cases of PPPs are introduced to illustrate conditions for PPP success and to underscore the need for sound analysis and need for sustainability, stakeholder engagement and good governance.\n\nWeek 2: Getting Decision-Making Right: PPP Frameworks and Institutions\nWhether undertaking PPPs as a series of ad hoc projects or through a coordinated program, PPPs require a change of approach and mind-set to delivering services and infrastructure. What does this mean for government institutions and what approaches are needed to manage this change? \n\n\n\nThis module examines the principles, value and challenges of putting in place a supportive framework to facilitate the execution of PPP projects with the aim of increased infrastructure investment and improved service delivery. While there is no “model” legal or organizational framework for PPPs, a clear and well-communicated articulation of the policy rationale for PPPs as well as the organization of laws, processes and institutional responsibilities that define how PPPs will be implemented are common elements that help ensure a positive private sector response.  You will be introduced to lessons learned from the execution of PPPs and how these lessons can be incorporated into successful PPP frameworks. In Week 2, an overview of the different stages of the PPP life cycle is also presented and the first stage of the PPP project cycle (project identification and screening) is explained. This overview provides the foundation for the discussions in weeks three and four, which will go into deeper into the procurement and contract management stages of the PPP project cycle.\n\nWeek 3: Attracting the Right Partner: Procuring PPPs\nBeing able to engage the right private sector partner starts with a well-prepared, commercially sustainable project. This module begins with a discussion about what is needed to demonstrate the “business case” to take forward a project as a PPP and the importance of structuring the PPP arrangements to ensure an appropriate risk allocation between the private sector sponsor, the financiers of the project, and the government. A well-designed and implemented transaction process is equally important, to ensure the best deal for government and to interest potential private sector partners who are able to achieve the desired efficiency and other improvements for the public users.  However, managing a PPP transaction through to contract award is a complex and iterative process. This module walks through the stages of the tender process and explains the challenges in achieving a successful outcome.  Finally, the module introduces the management of unsolicited proposals which, while outside a competitive tender process, may be a useful source of innovative ideas, but need to be subject to a thorough evaluation to ensure they respond to government needs efficiently.\n\nWeek 4: Making the Partnership Work: Implementing PPPs\nWhen a PPP contract is signed with a private party, the work of the partnership begins, and both private and public parties have to live up to their responsibilities. PPP contracts attempt to identify and plan for the potential events that could occur during the life of the PPP but can rarely imagine all events into the future. Consequently, developing a strong and trustful partnership and a solid contract management approach is important to achieve the long-term objectives of the PPP. This stage spans the life of the PPP agreement beginning when the PPP contract is signed until the partnership ends. This module presents the fundamentals and challenges of contract management, enforcing the PPP contract requirements and, potentially, renegotiating or terminating contracts. \n\n \n\nCourse Tracks\n\nParticipants can participate in one of two tracks:\n\n\n\nTrack 1: PPP Awareness (2 hours/week).\nTrack 2: Policy and Practice (3-4 hours/week).\n\nParticipants can move from the PPP Awareness track to the Policy and Practice track at any point during the course. \n\nWe encourage participants to join the Policy and Practice track to deepen their knowledge of the subject.\n\nTrack 1 – PPP Awareness\n \n\nTarget Audience\nThis track is suitable for anyone with a general interest in PPPs and desire to increase their understanding about PPPs.  The course provides insight into key concepts and issues in developing, procuring and implementing PPPs. \n \nCommon Objective\nTo understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services.\n\nAssignments\n\nAssignments focus on facilitating an understanding of the mandatory course material that is covered in the video talks and core readings through multiple choice quizzes and one peer-reviewed opinion piece on a key topic about PPPs.\n\nTrack 2 – Policy and Practice\n \n\nTarget Audience\nThis track is designed for those wishing to gain greater knowledge of PPPs, and to develop networks of practice with counterparts from around the world. While this course only touches the surface of knowledge and experience about PPPs, references and next steps will be offered for those wishing to continue their learning. \n \n\nCommon Objective \nTo understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services.\n\n\nAssignments\nIn additional to multiple choice quizzes and the Track 1 assignment, this track includes a project where participants identify an infrastructure project that could be developed as a PPP and create a digital artifact that can be used as a proposal to convince the government to undertake the project. The digital artifact should clearly articulate the value of the project to the government (and for its citizens) and demonstrate how the project would have a balanced risk allocation between the government and the private sector.\n\n Connect\n\nCommunicate and share resources via Twitter using #PPPMOOC, and follow the discussion @WBG_PPP. \n\nSign up for a free account at http://twitter.com.\n                                    ",

Together we will explore ideas associated with digital scholarship, open scholarship, and social scholarship. We will also investigate how particular tools and practices may enhance the impact and reach of scholarship, and we will explore the challenges and tensions associated with emerging forms of scholarship. By the end of the course I hope that participants will be better informed about the role of social media in the lives of knowledge workers and academics and decide whether and to what extent they might personally use social media/networks for academic purposes. This course is of immediate relevance to doctoral students, academics, and knowledge workers. Faculty development professionals and faculty members who teach research methods courses may also find this course worthwhile.\r\nA note regarding learners located in British Columbia: If you create an Instructure Canvas account to participate in this course, you will be using software applications that store your personal information or other information you provide on computer servers located outside Canada.

Quality has become a critical driver for long-term success through continuous process improvement and customer satisfaction. Quality Management today concerns the entire value chain, encompassing multi-tiered supplier networks and customer service and returns.\n\nThis business and management course balances the quantitative elements of quality engineering with a managerial approach to using quality in an organization to effect change. We cover the statistical basics needed for a Six-Sigma Green Belt certification, following the well-known process-improvement cycle: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The most important quality methods and techniques are taught, including sampling, statistical process control, process capability, regression analysis, and design of experiments. Quality management is examined, from the viewpoint of quality incorporated into product design, measuring and controlling quality in production and improving quality, using interactive, guided projects and case studies. The course closes with the presentation of a full Six-Sigma project.\n\nThe contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding TUM class (Quality Engineering and Management) and will enable you to immediately understand and apply quality concepts in your work and research.\n\nWHY TAKE THIS COURSE? \n\nQuality issues appear everywhere and affect the entire organisation.\n\tYou'll quickly master quality concepts so that you can apply quality tools and drive quality programs within your own organisation.\n\tYou'll gain the fundamentals for a Six-Sigma Green Belt in a manageable and positive learning environment, along with the chance to discuss with staff and fellow learners worldwide.\n\n\n                                    ",

As a result, China influences the world with its outbound travel, trade, politics and culture. China is a society transforming itself through economic development where travelling and tourism play an important role. Tourism is a vital part of the global economy and the number of Chinese travelers to overseas destinations is growing rapidly. For example, 1.8 million Chinese tourists visited the US and spent a whopping $21.1 billion in 2014. That number could top $80 billion by 2021, according to some industry analysts.\n\nThis course explores present and future development and trends in the tourism and hospitality business in China. It introduces the travel trends within and outside China from global perspectives. The political, economic, and social influence of tourism are examined from both hosts’ and guests’ point of view. \n\nThis bilingual and interactive course helps you understand China’s tourism sector from its importance on the global scale to its local impacts. Understanding the country and its people will empower you to continue this conversation with Chinese travelers, or travel throughout China yourself.\n\n                                    ",

Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services publics par des PPP efficaces.\n\nLe cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures, des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins, L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.\n\nCe cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP, que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien, un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.\n\n~~ A propos du cours\n\nPartout dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP) sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\n\nDurant ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\nPlusieurs ressources seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens, des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\n\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\n\nCe premier module explique comment et pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures. Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\n\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\n\nCe module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\n\n~~ Semaine 3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\n\nCe module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement. Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration de l’appel d’offre.\n\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise en œuvre du PPP \n\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat, et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\n\n~~ Comment bénéficier au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\n\nLes participants peuvent choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels. Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer avec des professionnels et des praticiens. Le parcours « Politique et Pratique des PPP » est destiné aux auditeurs souhaitant obtenir une meilleure connaissance des PPP et approfondir leur apprentissage.\n\nQuel que soit le parcours choisi, des questions seront soulevées et des points clés seront discutés sur le forum Coursera tout au long de la semaine. Nous espérons qu’en plus du forum de discussion, vous vous connecterez sur des réseaux sociaux (tels Twitter et Google+) pour profiter pleinement de votre participation au cours. Les membres de l’équipe de cette formation en ligne seront là pour vous aider à développer une communauté d’internautes pour favoriser votre collaboration durant le cours et au-delà.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Réduire le déficit d’infrastructures : le rôle des PPPNul n’ignore qu’il existe d’importants écarts de richesse entre les pays du monde, mais il est important de rappeler quelques chiffres pour en prendre toute la mesure : il y a encore aujourd’hui 1,2 milliard de personnes qui n’ont pas l’électricité ; au moins un tiers de la population mondiale rurale n’est pas desservie par une route praticable en toutes saisons ; près de 663 millions de personnes n’ont pas accès à de l’eau potable et, enfin, 60 % de la population mondiale n’a pas accès à internet.Prendre les bonnes décisions : les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPPSusciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié : la passation des PPPCette semaine commence par des exposés vidéo et par la lecture d’ouvrages et d’articles traitant de la préparation d’un projet pour le « marché ». Vous apprendrez comment les projets sont structurés, comment leur viabilité commerciale est jaugée, et comment les risques sont évalués et répartis. Vous apprendrez également comment les contrats sont structurés en fonction des particularités, de la taille et du périmètre du projet, ainsi que du secteur concerné. Enfin, grâce aux exemples d’études de cas présentés dans les vidéos et dans les références bibliographiques, vous apprendrez comment un appel d’offres pour un PPP est mis en oeuvre.Obtenir un partenariat réussi : la mise en oeuvre du PPPCette semaine, vos lectures et les exposés vidéo faisant intervenir différents spécialistes vous permettront de comprendre quels facteurs contribuent à des PPP efficaces et productifs. Vous\napprendrez quelles mesures les pouvoirs publics peuvent prendre pour permettre la bonne exécution du PPP, et comment les changements peuvent être gérés sur toute la durée du contrat.\n                                    ",

What are the key domains and components of personal wellbeing?\n  Organisational and community: how do communities and organisations facilitate wellbeing? What is community vitality? What is a healthy organisational climate?\n  National and international: What is national wellbeing and how can we measure and promote it?\n\n\nLearn with wellbeing researchers and practitioners\n\nThe course has been developed by the University of Edinburgh, with support from the Scottish Universities Insight Institute and Scotland’s Futures Forum, and contributions from a range of organisations, including Oxfam, Carnegie UK Trust, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Volunteering Scotland.\n\nThe course team has a wealth of experience on the national and international wellbeing debate, having researched topics such as happiness and subjective wellbeing, and the impact of the welfare state on them.\n\n\n                                    ",

Business processes determine what gets done, when and how, allowing organizations to achieve their strategic goals.\n\nThis course exposes you to “process thinking”. As you engage with the course you will become aware of how business processes are around you everywhere, and the key role they play both in your personal and professional life as you provide and consume products and services.\n\nYou will learn about the benefits of systematically managing business processes through BPM, how this differs from related disciplines, and the key phases of a BPM project. Professor Marcello La Rosa from the Queensland University of Technology’s BPM Discipline is supported by a team of international experts to lead this short course. You will also have the opportunity to engage with other learners from around the world to share your insights and experiences.\n\nSee the world through a business process management lens\n\nEvery organisation runs a large number of business processes. This free online short course begins by posing the question: “How can we leverage knowledge of business processes to improve organisational performance in this complex, changing world?”\n\nWeek 1: “What?” and “Why?”\n\nIn Week 1 we will introduce business process management and process thinking through a real-world case study and answer the question about the “What?” and “Why?” of business process management.\n\nWeek 2: Process identification, modelling and analysis\n\nIn Week 2 we will look at the BPM lifecycle in more depth. You will become skilled in looking at business operations through a business process lens. In particular, we will focus on the first three phases of the lifecycle: identification, discovery (with a focus on modelling) and analysis.\n\nWeek 3: Process redesign, automation, monitoring and controlling\n\nIn Week 3 you will continue to elaborate on the idea of value-driven thinking as you learn about the next phases in the lifecycle: redesign, implementation (with a focus on automation), and monitoring and controlling.\n\n\n                                    ",

Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.\n\n                                    ",

When an artefact is looted or an artwork is stolen, we have ALL been robbed. We must work together to protect our heritage before it is too late.

The material addresses the most critical issues of modernity from Realism through Post-Impressionism. We will cover the stylistic changes that challenged academic art, the new subjects that confounded modern audiences, and the new roles and authority of the modern artist. To do this, we will focus on the European world through a series of video podcasts and online readings over five weeks. By the end of the course, you will understand the issues of modernity and the way that art and art-making addressed these issues as well as recognize the profound impact that 19th century Europe had in shaping our contemporary ideas of being “modern.”\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Modernity And Realism Becoming Modern\r\nSession 2: The Visual Culture Of Modern Europe: New Technologies, New Venues, New Ideas Century Photography &amp; Manet: Realism beyond Courbet\r\nSession 3: Impressionism: Problems And Issues Then And Now Impressionism: The Heroicization of Modern Life, Complications with Painting and Envisioning Modern Sculpture\r\nSession 4: Post-Impressionism And Artistic Genius Post Impressionism: Cezanne’s Critique, Beyond Cezanne: George Seurat, Gaugin and Myth and Primitivism and Van Gogh – Beyond the Myth of Artistic Genius\r\nSession 5: Edges And Resistance The Arts and Crafts Movement and Art Nouveau\n                                    ",

In order to create an artistic impression, artists select materials that allow image formation, and that lend color, emphasis, shape, and size to the object created.\n\nA scientist might follow up by asking, why those materials?  What characteristics do they have that allow them to embody the artist’s intent? How durable are they? Will they maintain the same qualities, both physical and aesthetic, they had when the work left the studio?\n\nConservation science further notes that all materials deteriorate over time, and then asks a follow-up question: What physical interventions are possible to maintain, preserve and protect the work as the artist intended? Whatever is done to the art object, the result must be to make the work recognizable as the artist’s work or the result is a failure.  \n\nThat is a key goal of this course- to understand, from a chemical point of view, how conservation protocols and the material aspects of an art work allow a better appreciation of an artwork and its creation, as well as confidence that it is the artist’s work.\n\nThese are not new problems. According to Leonardo da Vinci, the study of art should include the following topics:\n\nA knowledge of materials\n\tThe chemistry of colors\n\tThe mathematics of composition\n\tThe laws of perspective\n\tThe illusions of chiaroscuro\nAs the briefest study of Leonardo's life shows, he was clearly ahead of his time in wanting to understand the reasons for a vast array of natural and artificial phenomena. Even so, a thorough understanding of those subjects listed above still escapes us today – but, progress has been made and that progress is at once the subject matter and the goal of this course.\n\nCourse banner painting: Unknown (previously attributed to Vincent van Gogh), Poppies, c.1886-c.1887, oil on canvas, Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Bequest of Anne Parrish Titzell, 1957.617\n\n                                    ",

We will develop a critical view on architecture and learn how to “read” buildings both from their exteriors and interiors. We will examine the evolution of New York and at the same time try to understand the recent challenges and opportunities for architecture and the city.\r\nThis course will offer on-site architectural tours of New York City in relation to the 6 weeks of the course. We will visit selected areas of Manhattan, an urban laboratory for history, economics, social context, construction, and design. Course participants will learn the progression of development from a village to a contemporary metropolis and hence to a world city. We will draw, read, take pictures and engage in exiting online and in-person discussions about the architecture of New York.\r\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\r\nCourse participants will develop an understanding of the development of the city, including an overview of economic and market realities, the needs of infrastructure, the imposition of regulatory code requirements, as well as the “filter-up” of aesthetics in the overall construct of the City.  Physical shape began with the very initial colonial claims on the land, but has also been formed by various cultural interventions over the past 400 years.\r\n- Understand the act of Building to be a complex reflection of a specific Time and Culture.  Recognize specific Values that drove development, the Legislation that shaped physical change, and the Inventions that enabled the development of New York City.\r\n- Explain all of the above in an individual research projects, using both text and graphics.\r\n- Distinguish key 19th or 20th century buildings and urban plans that influenced Manhattan’s development.\r\n- Articulate the meaning and significance NY architecture in a final research assignment.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to New York Architecture\r\nWeek 2: Lower Manhattan form the origins to the new WTC\r\nWeek 3: Lower East Side, the Bowery and SoHo\r\nWeek 4: The Village, Chelsea and the High Line\r\nWeek 5: Midtown Beaux-Arts and the city of towers\r\nWeek 6: Lincoln Center, Central Park, and Upper East Side\n                                    ",

Hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, draught and brush fires are increasingly occurring in different part of the world due to climate change. In times of crisis, the whole world should act to help refugees and environmental migrants with the recovery and rebuilding efforts. Designers have the opportunity to propose housing solutions that can help people, protecting them from natural hazards with safer homes and cities. We need to take action now.\r\nThe goal of this online course is to generate designs for resilient housing for the people living in areas endangered by natural hazards. The participants in this course will design affordable and easy to build houses, which could be implemented by OCHA, USAID, WBG, and other international organizations. They will work in teams of architects, planners, engineers, and social workers from all over the world. After the course, a selection of the projects will be placed the Open Online Academy website OOAc.org, so anyone can download and use them. \r\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\r\nCourse participants will learn about the design of resilient architecture and how it can be implemented both in rural and urban settings. They will improve their design and collaboration skills, working with a global community of professionals from all over the world. They will be learning from each other, as they will present their work publicly each week and receive feedback from the professors and fellow students. The work will be done in teams, which will work together on developing integral projects that include aspects of architectural design, structural engineering, building technology, social space, community development, economic feasibility, sustainability and resilience.\r\n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Natural Hazards and Areas Affected.\r\nWeek 2: Resilient Design Precedents\r\nWeek 3: Spatial Design\r\nWeek 4: Resilient Unit Design\r\nWeek 5: Unit Aggregation Strategies\r\nWeek 6: Urban Design\r\nWeek7: Project Submission and Jury\n                                    ",

The\nbrain actively generates sleep, and the first third of the course will\noverview the neurobiological basis of sleep cycle control. The course provides\na cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances\nsuch as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The\nsecond third of the course will cover sleep-dependent changes in physiology\nand sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders\nof excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic\ncontrol. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote\nobesity.

Students will explore the diversity of Palaeozoic lineages within a phylogenetic and evolutionary framework. This course examines the evolution of major vertebrate novelties including the origin of fins, jaws, and tetrapod limbs. Students also explore key Canadian fossil localities, including the Burgess Shale (British Columbia), Miguasha (Quebec), and Man On The Hill (Northwest Territories). Watch a preview of the course here: https://uofa.ualberta.ca/courses/paleontology-vertebrate-evolution\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The Phanerozoic BeginsIn this lesson we take you back to the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon to learn what it truly means to have backbone, as we encounter the key anatomical features of vertebrates and their closest chordate relatives.  We’ll also introduce the language of evolution – phylogenetics – as we examine some of the contenders for the title of ‘The Earliest Vertebrate’, and give you a crash course in sedimentology, so you can begin to piece together the spectacular environments that were home to our early aquatic ancestors. Just a quick note before you get started: 'Palaios' is the Greek word for 'ancient', so palaeontology or paleontology is the study of ancient life. Both spellings are correct, with palaeontology used in Britain, and paleontology more common in the US.Learning to SwimThe old problem of the comparative anatomist was exactly how to compare two animals that appeared, at first glance, to look nothing alike. How, do you compare cows and lobsters? Well, in this lesson you’ll not only learn how to compare crustaceans and cattle, but you’ll also quickly learn that there’s more to a vertebrate than just a backbone as we delve into basic vertebrate anatomy. We’ll cover all the need-to-know anatomical terms and directions, as well as specialist features like the lateral line system, which not only helped early fish avoid predation, but is also the main reason why you find it very difficult to catch fish with your bare hands today! We will also explore the immense diversity of the jawless vertebrates including the tenacious Cyclostomata, the elusive Conodonta, and, long before Ankylosaurus, a group of heavily armoured jawless fishes – the ostracoderms.Learning to BiteThe Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian Periods were times of great continental, oceanic and climactic change that brought about the Earth’s first mass extinction events. With environmental catastrophes opening up new ecological niches, a trait evolved in early vertebrates that would prove so successful that over 99% of modern vertebrates still retain it: jaws. In this lesson we will try to understand the geographical and temporal background of early vertebrate diversity, as well as the impact and origin of the evolution of jaws on vertebrate life. Introducing huge predators such as Dunkleosteus along the way, we’ll explore the incredible diversity of the Gnathostoma (the jawed fishes), mainly from fossils known from the spectacular Late Devonian site of Miguasha in Quebec. So get ready for a lesson you can really sink your teeth into!Learning to WalkAlthough this lesson marks the end of the beginning of the vertebrate story, we still have some bones left to pick! In this last lesson we’ll look at the features of the Osteichthyes (the bony fishes) and examine the differences between two immensely successful vertebrate groups; one that conquered the water: the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes), and one that eventually conquered the land: the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). We’ll investigate how the sarcopterygians gave rise to the tetrapods, meet our very first tetrapod ancestors like Acanthostega, and introduce the features that were essential in making the leap from water to land. Along the way we’ll meet some living fossils, see some incredible evolutionary adaptations, and learn about our earliest terrestrial origins – it’s time to step up and finish the tale of ‘Early Vertebrate Evolution’! \n                                    ",

The weather is always in the news – and we’ll be exploring some of the more recent notable weather events.\n\nWe’ll also investigate everyday weather processes, which determine whether or not you need to take your umbrella with you. This course offers an ideal opportunity to discuss both the daily and more exceptional weather events with learners worldwide.\n\nLearn from experts about the basics of forecasting the weather\n\nThe course features interviews with experts from the University of Reading’s Meteorology Department and the Royal Meteorological Society; two leading organisations in the field of meteorology.\n\nEach week you’ll learn from a mix of background articles, case studies and practical, video demonstrations – some of which you can try at home. We will also invite you to complete some fieldwork of your own; investigate your local microclimate and try your hand at our forecasting activity! We’ll equip you with the knowledge you need to help you make an educated guess each week about the following weekend’s weather and invite you to share your predictions on the RMetS website.

This course examines the diversity, adaptations, convergence, and phylogenetic relationships of extinct marine reptiles. Students will explore three major groups of marine reptiles: ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs. Watch a preview of the course here: https://uofa.ualberta.ca/courses/paleontology-marine-reptiles\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to Marine ReptilesWelcome to the first lesson of Palaeontology: Ancient Marine Reptiles. In this lesson we will explore the main theme of the course: the aquatic problem. In other words, what happens when a terrestrial animal returns to the water permanently? How do air-breathing, land-lubbing creatures once again adapt to life in the sea? Life in water is very different than life on land. Water is much denser than air, which affects all aspects of an animal's life including movement, sight, and hearing. In addition, animals that return to the water cannot breathe water, and so must return to the surface for air. Water also conducts heat much better than air, making staying warm and active a challenge. Despite all these obstacles, many land animals have returned to the water throughout the course of evolutionary history. In fact, many examples of them are living today including whales, seals, crocodiles, sea turtles and penguins. Each of these animals had ancestors that returned to the water. The process of overcoming the challenges associated with this transition is what we refer to as the aquatic problem. This lesson will explore many different types of adaptations that modern and extinct animals have evolved to meet these challenges. You will be introduced to some extinct groups of reptiles you have probably never heard of, and will gain a new appreciation for how well suited modern marine animals are to their environment. Just a quick note before you get started: 'Palaios' is the Greek word for 'ancient', so palaeontology or paleontology is the study of ancient life. Both spellings are correct, with palaeontology used in Britain, and paleontology more common in the US.IchthyopterygiansWelcome back! We hope that you enjoyed the first lesson of the Ancient Marine Reptiles mini MOOC. In lesson one, we discussed a variety of modern and extinct groups of aquatic amniotes. Some of these groups would have been familiar to you, and some you had probably never heard of before. We also explored some of the many differences between living in water and living on land, and we gave examples of how some amniote groups have overcome these challenging differences. As you may have already seen, some of the solutions to the different aspects of the aquatic problem were solved in the same way by unrelated groups- a phenomenon called convergence. \n\nThe next three lessons will build on your understanding of the aquatic problem as we investigate it more detail in three extinct groups of marine reptiles: the ichthyopterygians, sauropterygians, and mosasauroids. Each lesson will follow the same general outline. First, we will introduce you to the group and some of its diversity. The second part of each lesson will focus on how that group adapted to solve the aquatic problem, and how this resulted in specializations for feeding, locomotion and reproduction. Finally we will give you an overview of the evolutionary history of the group through time and space, as well as presenting some important fossils and localities from Canada and around the world. \n\nIn lesson two, we will study the first of the three major groups of extinct marine amniotes: the ichthyopterygians. The ichthyopterygians were highly specialized animals. Most of the later members looked something like a dolphin or a tuna, a great example of convergent evolution. These reptiles were probably among the fastest aquatic creatures that ever lived. They were found all over the world, from the early Triassic to the mid-Cretaceous, a span of 150 million years. \n\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with the history and diversity of this group, and be able to appreciate some of their impressive specializations to solve the aquatic problem. \nSauropterygiansWelcome back! We hope you enjoyed the lesson on ichthyopterygians, the first of three in depth explorations of an extinct marine reptile group that we will cover. In this lesson you learned that ichthyosaurs are among the most specialized reptiles that ever lived. They had many adaptations to solving the aquatic problem including large eyes for seeing in deep water, powerful tails to power their thunniform swimming, and two sets of flippers for stability and steering. We also discussed the hypothesis that ichthyosaurs may have overcome the problem of being cold-blooded reptiles living in water by evolving some endothermic capabilities. Even though ichthyopterygians were well adapted for a life in the water, this lineage still went extinct long before the End-Cretaceous Mass Extinction for unknown reasons. \n\t\nThe lesson you are about to start will follow a similar format to lesson 2, but instead of ichthyopterygians, we will be investigating a second major marine reptile lineage: the sauropterygians. These animals shared the seas with the ichthyosaurs for much of their 180 million year existence. You may already know some of the members of this group such as the long-necked elasmosaurs and the massive-jawed pliosaurs such as Liopleurodon. In this lesson we will expand your knowledge of these animals by introducing you to their lizard-like ancestors and a wider variety of the derived members. We will present you with one of the biggest unsolved mysteries surrounding marine reptiles: how did plesiosaurs use their four massive, wing-like flippers to swim? We will also look at how they ate and reproduced, and we will finish by taking you on a worldwide tour of plesiosaur diversity through time. \n\nWe hope you enjoy learning about this group of reptiles, who had adaptations so unique that they have never been seen in any other lineage of marine tetrapods. \nMosasauroidsWelcome to the final lesson in Palaeontology: Ancient Marine Reptiles. The lesson you just finished gave you an in depth look at one of the most morphologically disparate groups of marine tetrapods to ever live. There were the turtle-shaped placodonts with crushing teeth; the extraordinarily long-neck elasmosaurs; and the pliosaurs with jaws massive enough to take on nearly any prey. Even though sauropterygians evolved many different body plans, they all shared certain adaptations for solving the aquatic problem such as live birth and appendicular locomotion. \nIn contrast, the final group we will investigate showed convergence on one morphotype. The mosasaurs, though diverse, were all fairly long reptiles, with large jaws, four flippers and a long, lobed tail. You may recognise one of them from Jurassic World, where an enormous genetically-engineered Mosasaurus leaped out of the water to eat a shark.  \n\nThis last lesson will once again start by examining the diversity of the group, from their terrestrial origins to last days of the Cretaceous when they ruled as apex predators. We will investigate the specific adaptations of the group to the aquatic problem, and finish with an overview of the history of mosasaurs throughout time and space. \n\nPlease enjoy the last lesson of Palaeontology: Ancient Marine Reptiles. It is an appropriate way to finish this course since the mosasaurs were among the largest and most powerful marine predators to ever live, and were the last major marine reptile group to evolve during the Mesozoic. \n\n                                    ",

Following his scientific, cultural, philosophical, and political trajectory, this course aims to track the changing role of physics in the 20th and 21st centuries. This history course addresses Einstein's engagement with relativity, quantum mechanics, Nazism, nuclear weapons, philosophy, the arts, and technology, and raises basic questions about what it means to understand physics in its broader history.\n \nParticipants in the course will follow seventeen lessons, each of which will present a mix of science (no prerequisites!) and the broader, relevant cultural surround.  Some weeks will examine the physics concepts, while others will see excerpts of films or discuss modernist poetry that took off from relativity. Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein’s works.  At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example. \n \nTypically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.   \n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

This course examines the anatomy, diversity, and evolution of theropod dinosaurs in relation to the origin of birds. Students explore various hypotheses for the origin of flight. Watch a preview of the course here: https://uofa.ualberta.ca/courses/paleontology-theropod-dinosaurs\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Bird AnatomyIn Lesson 1, we explore the anatomy and adaptations of birds, and meet the Victorian scientists who first suspected the link between the terrible lizards and modern birds. In order to fly, birds have undergone a series of anatomical specializations that distinguishes them from other vertebrates. However, many of the most striking and anatomically unusual traits of birds originated over 230 million years ago with the very first theropod dinosaurs. Just a quick note before you get started: 'Palaios' is the Greek word for 'ancient', so palaeontology or paleontology is the study of ancient life. Both spellings are correct, with palaeontology used in Britain, and paleontology more common in the US.Survey of Non-Avian TheropodsIn the wake of the Permian mass extinction, the prehistoric world was ripe for the taking. All the world’s landmass was consolidated into the single supercontinent: Pangaea. With no seas standing in their way, new terrestrial animal lineages were able to exploit new habitats all across the globe. Archosaurs, meaning ‘ruling reptiles’, came to dominate Triassic ecosystems. However, dinosaurian archosaurs were not the top predators. Instead, crurotarsans sat undisputed at the top of the food chain. The first theropods were small, but agile carnivores, and although they started out as the Darwinian equivalent of the mail room clerks, by the next geological period (the Jurassic), they were large and in charge. In Lesson 2, we will introduce you to some of the earliest theropods, and explore the anatomical secrets to their survival and eventual success.  We will also meet the largest land predators of all time. Coelurosaurs IIn the previous lesson, we explored how the various theropod lineages adapted to their role as apex predators. In this lesson, we will explore a new group of theropods, as much characterized by their speed and agility as their predatory prowess. The coelurosaurs were the most successful and diverse of all the theropods, and included herbivores, the smallest of all dinosaurs, and, of course, the mighty tyrannosaurs.Coelurosaurs IIDinosaurs had long been thought of as overgrown reptiles; cold blooded, swamp bound, with meagre intelligence and little to no social complexity. The ‘Dinosaur Renaissance’ was a revolution in palaeontological thinking that entirely transformed that traditional image of dinosaurs. In Lesson 4, we will see how new research and discoveries over the past fifty years have shaped our modern image of dinosaurs into one of energetic, intelligent animals, that likely displayed many of the complex social behaviours witnessed in modern birds. You’ll also meet the deinonychosaurs, A.K.A. ‘the raptors’, and you will learn the leading theories for how one group of dinosaurs learned to fly.The Avian World66 million years ago, an asteroid the larger than Mt. Everest collided with the earth and brought about the extinction of the dinosaurs…except birds! Now that you’re familiar with some of their larger Mesozoic ancestors and their bird-like features, it’s time to meet the avian lineage proper. With the evolution of flight, birds could exploit habitats and resources that were literally unreachable by other animals. The evolution of birds has been one of diversification. Flightlessness has evolved numerous times, as have specializations for insectivory, swimming, and predation. Although theropods may no longer dominate the land, they still rule the skies.        \n                                    ",

En découvrant que les termes médicaux et scientifiques sont des assemblages d’éléments, les étymons, que l’on trouve et retrouve dans le vocabulaire biomédical des différentes disciplines scientifiques ainsi que dans le vocabulaire usuel.Connaître et repérer ces étymons, c’est être capable de rattacher un mot nouveau à une famille, d’en comprendre le sens avant même d’en connaître la définition ! C’est être plus efficace pour le mémoriser à long terme. Bref, c’est se préparer pour bien aborder ses études !De plus, l’étudiant bénéficie d’une préparation supplémentaire, car les mots et les étymons lui font découvrir à l’avance les nouvelles disciplines scientifiques qu’il ne connaît pas encore : la biologie cellulaire, la biochimie ou l’embryologie par exemple.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Semaine 1 : Apparition et disparition, croissance et destruction sont les vedettes de la semaine 1...Semaine 2 : glucose ? glycome ? glucide ? glycine ? glycogène ?

This course will explore the real-world science behind virus and parasite biology, cyber security and epidemiological modeling.\r\nWe will see each of these topics featured in clips from The Strain and discuss real-world examples of parasites changing host behavior, hackers taking down communication networks and diseases rampaging through populations.\r\nThis course will be divided into 3 “strains” of learning…\r\nSTRAIN 1: PARASITIC INVASION\r\n“Scientists have no idea just how many species of parasites there are, but they do know one dazzling thing: parasites make up the majority of species on Earth. According to one estimate, parasites may outnumber free-living species four to one. In other words, the study of life is, for the most part, parasitology.” – Carl Zimmer\r\nIn the Parasitic Invasion Strain, we will discuss the following questions:\r\n\r\nHow do humans interact with parasitic pathogens?\r\nCan parasites change the behavior of their host?\r\nWhat effect does the human “microbiome”, the entire collection of bacteria that resides within us, have on our health?\r\n\r\nJoin us in an exploration of human-pathogen interactions. We will discuss pathogens that can reside in humans for years asymptomatically, but can potentially change human behavior in strange and inexplicable ways. To a modern microbiologist, a human being is merely a vessel for carrying bacteria around! We will discover our current understanding of the human “microbiome” — the entire collection of bacteria that resides within us, which powerfully influences our health and disease. Finally, we will explore conventional parasites that we are familiar with, and the diseases that they cause.\r\nSTRAIN 2: DISEASE DYNAMICS\r\n“The worst pandemic in modern history was the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed tens of millions of people. Today, with how interconnected the world is, it would spread faster.” – Bill Gates\r\nIn this Disease Dynamics Strain, we will discuss the following questions:\r\n\r\nHow do we predict and track a large scale disease outbreak?\r\nHow do we prevent such rapid disease spread?\r\nWhen resources are limited, how do we ethically decide to which patients to treat?\r\n\r\nDiseases can quickly spread from a few isolated patient cases to global pandemics. How do we prevent such rapid disease spread? What factors affect the virulency of disease pathogens? How do we predict and track a large scale disease outbreak? When resources are limited, how do we ethically decide which patients to treat? Delve into these questions and more as you discover the dynamics of disease.\r\nSTRAIN 3: CYBER ATTACKS\r\n“Cyberspace has become the fifth domain of warfare, after land, sea, air, and space. Some scenarios imagine the almost instantaneous failure of the systems that keep the modern world turning. As computer networks collapse, factories and chemical plants explode, satellites spin out of control, and the financial and power grids fail.” – The Economist, July 1, 2010\r\nIn the Cyber-attacks Strain, we will discuss the following questions:\r\n\r\nWhat form do cyber-attacks take?\r\nHow do hackers infiltrate and disrupt computer systems?\r\nHow can we protect our personal and business computer systems from security breaches?\r\n\r\nCyber-attacks are inspired and targeted attacks carried out mostly through the Internet that generate extensive damage. Take a closer look at several types of cyber-attacks taking place in today’s world and the sophistication behind them. Understand more about cyber-attacks on the public through the spread of malware and its potential impact. In addition, take a deep dive into the world of hacking and discover ways to protect yourself from harmful attacks.\r\nCOURSE FORMAT\r\nStudents in this course are welcome to focus on just one learning strain, dabble with a couple different learning strains, or fully immerse with all three. You can earn a badge for each learning strain that you complete.\r\nEach learning strain will feature weekly lecture videos, quizzes, discussion forums, optional readings, and bonus videos featuring UCI research efforts in related fields. In addition to the learning strains, students will view video excerpts from The Strain and listen to discussions about how the weekly science lecture topics are depicted in the show.\r\nAt the end of the course, students have the option of completing a final project and showcasing their learning to the course community through fun, multimedia productions.\n\n                                    ",

Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications.

As we examine their lives and work, we will explore aspects of the food world ranging from restaurant criticism to food writing, looking in particular at cookbooks, magazines, and newspapers.\r\n\r\nEach unit focuses on one of the six innovators and draws on panel discussions and interviews with food writers, researchers, and practitioners who knew or worked with them. During the six weeks, you will interact with other students and an instructor, contribute to a blog, and share your writing and images. You will also have the option to submit your own research and reflections to the New School Web magazine, The Inquisitive Eater, a forum for food lovers, professionals, artists, and academics to discuss the role of food in our lives, and its impact on the environment, politics, economics, nationalism, poverty, inequality, and family. We hope this course will encourage you to deepen your exploration of food. With this in mind, we have provided a space for you to discuss your ideas, practice and improve your investigative and analytical skills, and experiment with your ability to communicate through word and image.\r\n\r\nAs we noted in Innovators of American Cuisine 1, we do not aim to create a canon by identifying a set of founding fathers and mothers, but rather to draw attention to the cultural and social dynamics that have brought American cuisine to its present flourishing and popularity. We invite you to look beyond current trends and celebrities to reflect on the contributions of these luminaries to the history of U.S. culinary arts.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend to set U.S. culinary arts as a model. Through the close examination of the American experience and the contributions of innovators to its gastronomy, we want to help you acquire critical tools you can adapt and use to explore your own food culture, wherever you are.

For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called XaoS 3.4, which is distributed by the Free Software Foundation under a GNU General Public License.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome - Let's Get StartedIn this module we'll introduce the concept of emergence and provide an orientation to how this course will proceed. The Mystery of FoamCan a substance be both a solid and a liquid? In this module we’ll take a close look at our first emergent phenomena, complex fluids.Chaotic DynamicsAre seemingly random events truly random? In this module, we'll examine ways that deterministic processes can produce the appearance of randomness.Pattern Formation and Systems BiologyHave you ever wondered why tigers have spots and leopards have spots? This module helps to explain how these and other patterns form in nature.Quantum Coherence, Many-Body States, and Quantum ComputingHow can we study quantum events from both a reductionist and emergent perspective? This module takes a look at the atomic and quantum level of some everyday phenomena.ConsciousnessOne of the most awe inspiring emergent phenomena is how consciousness emerges from complex collections of atoms and molecules. In this module, we’ll take a look at how the various regions of our brain coordinate and interact to produce consciousness.\n                                    ",

Or that the scales on their skin have influenced the way humans design boats, planes, and even swim suits? Or that sharks have more senses than humans?\n\nIn this biology course, you will learn how scientists study sharks. You will join researchers on location in labs, aquariums, and oceans across the globe to learn about the biodiversity, biology, and conservation of sharks, rays, and chimaeras.\n\nIn this activity‑rich course, you’ll track movements of a wild shark, observe shark habitats and behavior, and dig deep into the fossil record. You will also examine topics in the functional anatomy, sensory biology, reproduction, behavior, and ecology of many of the 1,200 living species.\n\nThis is an exciting time to be a shark biologist. An explosion of new research methods and technologies are leading to a surprising world of discovery. We’ll introduce new, as well as traditional techniques, for classifying sharks, understanding behavior, and unraveling the mysteries of shark evolution. You’ll be invited to explore global shark populations and consider shark-human interactions and their impacts on history and culture.\n\nYou’ll be rewarded by your ability to see virtually any animal with new eyes.

Antes de empezarEn este módulo encontrarás información sobre el funcionamiento del MOOC. Entre la documentación encontrarás las bases para participar en un concurso de Johan Cruyff Institute, cuyo premio es una beca para cursar un Posgrado de Patrocinio Deportivo. Como verás es voluntario, puedes cursar el MOOC sin necesidad de participar en el concurso.  Módulo 1. Principios básicos del patrocinio deportivoSi estás aquí, es que ya has revisado detenidamente la información básica del Módulo 0, ¡perfecto! ¡vamos a empezar!. Como verás, en este módulo encontrarás tanto información básica del patrocinio como de la Fundación Cruyff, en la cual se centra el caso de estudio transversal que estará presente durante todas las semanas. Con la Fundación Cruyff podrás adentrarte a conocer qué es el patrocinio y cómo éste es esencial para que una fundación pueda llevar a cabo su actividad. De la misma manera podrás averiguar en qué consiste un evento deportivo, un Cruyff Court, y en cómo éste puede alinearse con los patrocinados. Pero... paso a paso, tenemos tiempo... ¿no saber por dónde empezar? dale un vistazo a la \"Presentación del módulo 1\".Módulo 2. Los actores del patrocinio deportivo¿Preparad@ para el segundo módulo? Vamos a dar un paso más en el mundo del patrocinio deportivo, durante este módulo tendremos en cuenta la relación que existe entre una marca y un evento, es decir, entre patrocinador y patrocinado. Por este motivo, en el apartado del caso de estudio de esta semana encontrarás información de los Cruyff Courts de la Fundación Cruyff, puesto que será el evento que te retaremos a patrocinar más adelante. Asimismo, también encontrarás información interesante en los materiales complementarios.Módulo 3. La activación de un patrocinio deportivo (I)Estamos ya en el ecuador del curso ¿cómo vas?. En los próximos módulos trabajaremos 4 tipos de activaciones: marca, negocio, interno y externo. Ahora empezaremos por las de marca y negocio. Para que puedas profundizar en ellas, te proponemos unos contenidos clave y un espacio de foro para compartir ejemplos y reflexionar sobre ellos. En los espacio de foro también encontrarás ejemplos de activaciones de compañer@s de la pasada edición. Antes de publicar tu mensaje, revisa que tu ejemplo contenga toda la información que se pide (encontrarás las pautas dentro de cada espacio de foro).

Images of today's celebrities and fashion mavens are ever-present, but long before the selfie, sculpture and painting captured individuals and their fashion styling. Designers still look to these powerful sources for fashion elements and inspiration, and this course will trace the history of clothing and the way that themes have been interpreted over the last 500 years.  Starting in the 15th century, we will view the fashion biographies of notable individuals and examine garments and ‘looks’ for their trend-setting elements. Fashion is extremely and pointedly cyclical, and garment elements and design ideas that look ‘fresh’ to a certain generation can often be directly or indirectly traced to a prior moment or figure in history. In this course we will look at some of these times and people, and compare and contrast them to fashion that has emerged. Contemporary designs will be reviewed to identify the reuse or redefinition of many of these details. We will progressively develop the eye and skill to sketch and create our own ideas through a creative journaling process, culminating in an original design project based on historical elements.  \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: From Fashion’s Rich Renaissance To Going Baroque Style Icons and Royal Clothes from 1450-1700\r\nSession 2: The Turn Of A Century Curves Into A Corset Fashions and the Fashionable from 1700 Through the Victorians\r\nSession 3: From Edward To Erte The Figures and Fashions that Comprised the Eras 1890-1920\r\nSession 4: Deco Drops The Drama For Wartime And Fashion Speeds Into The Future Tracing the Stars and Straps from 1920 into the Present\r\nSession 5: From Research To Revelation Using Fashion Inspired Materials in the Creative Process\n                                    ",

This curriculum investigates the practical, business side of design: getting organized and staying on-track through timeline projections, cost estimates and workflow charts in order to ensure success and profitability. Students will study the essential paperwork – estimates, memos, model releases, change orders and contact reports – and will look at contracts and copyright issues, and when to get legal and accounting assistance. Students will also learn the principles of research, and its important role in the work of a designer. From working in a small to mid-size design studio, to more independent roles, students will gain important skills in both understanding the context and needs of designers and the field broadly, and strategies for developing administrative processes that support these practices.\n\nThe program is intended for students who already have foundational training in Design, and who are looking to move into a design field in an administrative capacity, or for designers who are interested in gaining valuable management knowledge. On completion of the modules, students will understand the principles of how to make a business work cleanly and efficiently, how to manage yourself and your workflow, and how to ensure client relationships are productive and clear.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Where We Begin This session will introduce the basics of project management for designers: how it works, and how it can optimize workflow, time management, growth and general sanity. We will discuss both the practice and practical skills of effective project management.\r\nSession 2: Before A Project Starts - Part I This session will focus on how to gather information at the beginning of a project to understand the clients’ needs and create accurate (and inaccurate!) estimates.\r\nSession 3: Before A Project Starts - Part II This session will focus on how to create a contract that solidifies an agreement with the client, including expectations, estimates, signing, and how to handle red flags or other situations that may arise.\r\nSession 4: The Project Begins This session will focus on how to ensure a project runs smoothly from the beginning, through the use of meetings, timelines, milestones and deadlines, feedback and signoff processes - and how and when to adjust if the timeline changes.\r\nSession 5: Client Relations: Pitfalls &amp; Best Practices This session gets into the nitty-gritty of working with a client: how to handle comps, work with difficult clients, listen effectively, follow up, and move a project forward. Also, Scope Creep! What is it, and how to work with it.\r\nSession 6: Self-Management This session will introduce tools and strategies for self-management. We will look at how to manage more than one project at a time while staying sane, keeping clients happy and never missing a deadline through effective time management, communication and billing.\r\nSession 7: Bringing A Project To Launch This session will look at how to bring a project towards successful completion. We’ll learn how to avoid issues before they arise through the use of milestone checks, quality assurance and beta testing, and how to handle issues such as client bottlenecks, project changes, and our own mistakes.\r\nSession 8: Wrapping Up This session will cover essential steps for ending a project well. We’ll learn how to launch the project, handle post-launch issues and press, how (and why) to do a postmortem, arrange final payment, keep the door open for future work, manage any upgrades, changes, retainer agreements or nasty surprises, and wrap up!\n                                    ",

It provides easy access to an entire world of sound generation and processing techniques, as well as the ability to use input from sensors, portable multitouch devices, MIDI, and to have communication and control through local and remote networks without writing lines and lines of code. Pd is designed to be easy to use for the beginner, but still powerful for the experienced user. With Pd, you can start making sound right away without needing a background in complex math or coding. And because Pure Data patches can run as stand-alone applications or audio plug-ins on any laptop or mobile device, it is the perfect language for starting to experiment with computer music, creating your own music instruments, audio plug-ins, or designing full interactive sonic installations.  In this course we will start by reviewing the basics of digital sound and progress through the intricacies of sound generation, processing, and control, by means of practical and fully operational examples. Through this process we will learn about audio oscillators, filters, samplers, sensors, MIDI, and the OSC protocol.Assessments will consist of small assignments of increasing complexity covering individual topics such as building a virtual Theremin, a sample player, a basic drum machine, and controlling them from a mobile device or a camera using the OSC protocol, filtering MIDI notes by tonality, implementing some algorithmic composition techniques, and so on. A more complete and personal assignment that integrating several of the techniques studied during the course, will act as the final project.\n\n                                    ",

It combines really important information on the brain and learning with new evidence on the best ways to approach and learn math effectively. Many people have had negative experiences with math, and end up disliking math or failing. This class will give learners of math the information they need to become powerful math learners, it will correct any misconceptions they have about what math is, and it will teach them about their own potential to succeed and the strategies needed to approach math effectively. If you have had past negative experiences with math this will help change your relationship to one that is positive and powerful.\r\nThe course will feature Jo and a team of undergraduates, as well as videos of math in action - in dance, juggling, snowflakes, soccer and many other applications. It is designed with a pedagogy of active engagement. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 1: The Brain and Math Learning.\r\n\r\nKnocking Down the Myths About Math.Everyone can learn math well. There is no such thing as a “math person”. This session give stunning new evidence on brain growth, and consider what it means for math learners.\r\nMath and MindsetWhen individuals change their mindset from fixed to growth their learning potential increases drastically. In this session participants will be encouraged to develop a growth mindset for math.\r\nMistakes and SpeedRecent brain evidence shows the value of students working on challenging work and even making mistakes. But many students are afraid of mistakes and think it means they are not a math person. This session will encourage students to think positively about mistakes. It will also help debunk myths about math and speed.\r\n\r\nPart 2: Strategies for Success.\r\n\r\nNumber Flexibility, Mathematical Reasoning, and ConnectionsIn this session participants will engage in a “number talk” and see different solutions of number problems to understand and learn ways to act on numbers flexibility. Number sense is critical to all levels of math and lack of number sense is the reason that many students fail courses in algebra and beyond. Participants will also learn about the value of talking, reasoning, and making connections in math.\r\nNumber Patterns and RepresentationsIn this session participants will see that math is a subject that is made up of connected, big ideas. They will learn about the value of sense making, intuition, and mathematical drawing. A special section on fractions will help students learn the big ideas in fractions and the value of understanding big ideas in math more generally.\r\nMath in Life, Nature and WorkIn this session participants will see math as something valuable, exciting, and present throughout life. They will see mathematical patterns in nature and in different sports, exploring in depth the mathematics in dance and juggling. This session will review the key ideas from the course and help participants take the important strategies and ideas they have learned into their future.\r\n\n                                    ",

Between the geometry of the great pyramid and the tax bracket that you might be in? Between studying the protein content of bugs and comparing internet speeds? In this course we explore a range of interesting and practical real-world relationships hinging on the interplay between the linear and the quadratic.\n\nStudy real-world connections using algebra and geometry\n\nIn this free online course, we’ll look at a wide spectrum of interesting, and often surprising, mathematical relationships in our everyday world. These real-world interconnections can be studied using algebra and visualised concretely using graph paper and pencil, along with modern technologies such as graphing calculators and interactive graphing software.\n\nLinear and quadratic functions and their graphs allow us to make predictions, evaluate actions and test theories about many things - such as the maximal grade of railways, the trajectory of a football, the relationship between supply and demand in economics, and the difference between momentum and kinetic energy in physics. Linear and quadratic relations are balanced between algebra and geometry, with numerous connections to real life.\n\nExplore linear and quadratic relationships\n\nOur journey begins with the fundamental idea of direct proportionality. In the first week you’ll meet lots of examples of linear relationships in the world around us. Then you’ll learn to represent these relationships algebraically and graph them geometrically in the Cartesian plane to aid in visualisation.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, we’ll look at quadratic relations from Apollonius to Bezier. We’ll discuss the history, look at lots of practical examples, and show you how to solve an interesting variety of concrete problems.\n\nGain valuable skills for further study\n\nUnderstanding basic mathematical relationships is vital to many fields of study: biology, engineering, business, economics, political science and design. By the end of this course, you’ll have hands-on experience with a wide range of explicit examples, be familiar with a core area of pre-calculus mathematics, and be ready to go on to more advanced study of more sophisticated algebraic topics such as inverse relations and power laws.\n\nWhether you’re encountering these topics for the first time or brushing up on your high school mathematics, we hope you’ll actively join our community on this journey through some fascinating and practical topics that have contributed much to our understanding of the world around us.\n\n\n                                    ",

Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology.\n\nThe finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry.

In learning about dogs you will be introduced to evolutionary and cognitive theory, learn about experimental methodology, see how dogs compare to other species, and even have the chance to try some of the cognitive games you learn about with your own dog. The course is a great introduction to the field of animal cognition and animal behavior but is also relevant to anyone interested in human evolution or even dog training. When you finish you will think about your dog in a new way, will be ready to apply your new knowledge, and will be prepared to take higher level classes in the evolutionary or cognitive sciences. The Paradox of a Best Friend That Evolved From Our Worst EnemyThis module will provide an introduction to cognitive psychology and evolution, while having direct application to your dog. At the beginning of each lecture, Dr. Hare will suggest an optional reading from his book The Genius of Dogs, as well as free Dognition games to play at www.dognition.com/mooc. Dr. Hare discusses how our evolutionary relationship with dogs is a puzzle. He describes the meaning of cognition and what it looks like with modern research on animals. Last, he discusses what Dognition is and how can be used like a laboratory for the class. How Biology Studies Cognitive EvolutionIn this module, Dr. Hare describes how the internal processes of the mind are studied through experiments. He explains how animal problem solving is best explained as scientists work toward better understanding the topic. Next, he describes the ecological approach to cognition through an evolutionary lens, which involves Tinbergen's four levels of analysis. Dogs Are Cognitively RemarkableIn this module, Dr. Hare describes how dogs are cognitively remarkable. He begins by explaining theory of mind, which, when viewed through the ecological approach, suggests that social problem solving drove primate and human cognitive evolution. Next, he describes how good dogs are at understanding communicative intentions, especially compared to apes. Dr. Hare has three hypotheses to explain the remarkable communication found in domestic dogs. Evolutionary Accidents and Survival of the FriendliestIn this module, Dr. Hare explores three of his research studies he's done with foxes, New Guinea Singing Dogs, as well as research on wolves. He describes how early dog-wolves may actually be a product of natural selection rather than artificial selection, contrary to popular belief. He introduces a hypothesis called Survival of the Friendliest, which may explain how dogs, bonobos, and modern species evolved in contrast to close relatives, such as wolves and chimpanzees. Last, he relates the high level of social tolerance of these species to human by looking at human self-domestication.  Problems That Dogs Can and Cannot SolveIn this module, you will learn about the genius of dogs. Brilliant examples of the canine mind will be explored. Dogs seem to be capable of inferential reasoning using the \"principle of exclusion\" as well as learning new words by imitating humans. Next, Dr. Hare discusses dog's abilities to understand physical problem solving compared to other species (hint, this isn't most dog's strong suit). Last, he will discuss how dogs are not cooperative breeders, do have a relaxed social system, and are excellent hunting companions for humans. Finding Your Dog's GeniusIn this module, Dr. Hare will discuss the common myths of breed differences and what research (including citizen science Dognition data) has actually been done to understand potential differences between breeds. You will also listen to Dr. Hare debunk \"aggressive dog breed\" stereotypes by learning about the literature and studies that have been done on dog aggression. He poses an interesting question about the actual culprit for the dog aggression problem, which is not even a dog! Next, he will explain how important understanding dog cognition is to training strategies. Dr. Hare will discuss how, unfortunately, not all cultures love dogs, and some see them as food and pests. He suggests ways that humans can live with dogs for mutual benefit. Taking all that you've learned into account, Dr. Hare then discusses how Dognition is revolutionizing what we know about dogs and how beneficial it could be to your relationship with your dog as well as for science!

Mapping and modeling ecosystem services can help highlight the diverse benefits provided to people by nature (what and where) and explore how those benefits might change under different management options--thus bringing information about nature’s values into decisions in practical ways. With these approaches, we can improve the state of biodiversity and human well-being by motivating greater and more cost-effective investments in both.\r\nThis course introduces the Natural Capital Project’s (NatCap’s) approach to using ecosystem service information to inform decisions. It uses specific examples to illustrate how the approach has worked in each case and highlights key methods and tools used in implementation.\r\nSplit into four modules, NC101 first introduces the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services, the stocks and flows of vital benefits flowing from nature to people. The second module describes InVEST, NatCap’s software tool for mapping, modeling, and valuing ecosystem services. In addition, it provides guidance on project scoping and on matching approaches and tools to a project’s goals, decision context, timeline, capacity, and quality of data available. Modules 3-4 offer an overview of the skills needed to use InVEST models, including recommendations for how to effectively summarize and communicate model outputs to stakeholders and other audiences.\r\n\r\nINTENDED AUDIENCE\r\nThis course is intended for those interested in how natural capital approaches can inform decisions taken by governments, multi-lateral development institutions, the private and finance sectors, and non-governmental organizations. It can be a resource for individuals interested in simply learning about these concepts or for those interested in using the NatCap’s approaches and tools in research or to influence decisions. This course can also serve as a primer for those individuals planning to attend one of our in-person training workshops in the future.\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nThere are no prerequisites for this course. However, we recommend that you download InVEST and GIS software (either QGIS or ArcGIS) if you intend to follow the technical examples or complete the optional assessments contained in modules 3 and 4.\r\n\n\n                                    ",

This course teaches the concepts and mathematical methods behind the most powerful and universal metrics used by Data Scientists to evaluate the uncertainty-reduction – or information gain - predictive models provide. \n\nWe focus on the two most common types of predictive model - binary classification and linear regression - and you will learn metrics to quantify for yourself the exact reduction in uncertainty each can offer.  These metrics are applicable to any form of model that uses new information to improve predictions cast in the form of a known probability distribution – the standard way of representing forecasts in data science. \n\nIn addition, you will learn proper methodology to avoid common data-analytic pitfalls when forecasting – such as being “fooled by randomness” and over-fitting “noise” as if it were “signal.” \n\nUniquely among data-analytics offerings, this course empowers you to understand and apply quite advanced information theory methods – Bayesian Logical Data Analysis - in business practice, without needing any calculus or matrix algebra, or any knowledge of Matlab or R or software programming. \n\nYou will be able to answer all homework and quiz questions either by using basic algebra, or with the special custom Microsoft Excel Templates provided. Nor is any prior experience with Excel required; we will cover in detail at the beginning everything you need to know about using Excel to succeed in the course itself. If you already know Excel, you can skip that part. \n\nBe aware that this is not a broad general Excel skills course; it focuses on use of Excel to calculate information-related metrics, and to solve real business problems, such as developing your own predictive analytics model for which credit card applicants a bank should accept and which reject as too risky. Real problems are complicated! \n\nPersonally I think learning to solve real problems is also a great way to learn Excel. We use specific tools in the Excel toolbox to build something useful, and you can always go back and learn more tools in the toolbox – more Excel functions – if and when you ever need them. \n\nThis course requires some mathematical background: you should already know how to solve for an unknown using algebra; and have a basic familiarity with sigma (summation) notation; the concept of logarithms and working with bases other than base 10 (including base 2, and the natural logarithm and base “e”); and probability theory concepts such as calculating conditional, product, and joint probabilities. These concepts are assumed in the course rather than taught. All the “new” math taught in the course is summarized in a downloadable PDF document - \"Mathematical Supplement\" – please refer to it to decide if the difficulty level of this course seems right for you.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        About this Specialization and CourseThe Coursera Specialization: Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business, is about how 'Big Data' interacts with business, and how to use data analytics to create value for businesses. This specialization consists of four courses and a final Capstone Project, where you will apply your skills to real-world business process. You will learn to perform sophisticated data-analysis functions using powerful software tools such as Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and MySQL. To learn more, watch the video and review the specialization overview document we provided.The second course of the specialization: Mastering Data Analysis in Excel, is organized around a few big ideas: real-world businesses always decide what actions to take under conditions of partial uncertainty; data analysts seek to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers; finally, data analysts can and should quantify for decision-makers both how much can be learned from available data and how much uncertainty remains. In this second course of the specialization, you will be introduced to the realistic Credit Card Business Case Study that will track the key learning points in the course; analyze both historical credit card customer default data, and customer profit and loss data; learn to design two different predictive models (in essence, one that minimizes risk, and an alternative that maximizes profits); and make recommendations to decision-makers about which model should be used for future applicants and why.Excel Essentials for BeginnersWelcome! This week we will explore the essential Excel skills to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future. Working side by side with the lesson videos using Excel templates, you will develop the Excel skills needed to complete the Week 1 graded quiz and the Credit Card Business Case Study (Final Course Project). The Excel vocabulary and functions taught this week make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course, and are used to demonstrate and practice key course formulas and methods. Important note: Learners who already have intermediate Excel skills may skip over this module (by not watching the videos) but must still pass the Week 1 graded quiz. Before you attempt the quiz, we recommend you review the list of required Excel skills presented in the video below (Introduction to Using Excel in this Course), and make sure you can pass the ungraded practice quiz.Binary ClassificationWelcome! This week we will focus on models that divide data into two groups - Binary Classification. You will get a deep understanding of the quantitative metrics by which binary classification models are evaluated, and how the best model for a certain purpose is generally chosen. You will start to appreciate the different business situations that call for optimizing which classification metrics. The Credit Card Business Case Study (Final Course Project) gives you an opportunity to experiment with combining relevant input variables into a credit card default risk score in various ways.  You will then rank-order historical outcomes based on their scoring method, and optimize their method so as to maximize two different but equally critical binary classification metrics – the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the model’s cost per event.Information MeasuresWelcome! Business situations requiring decision-making under uncertainty are best characterized as probabilistic. This week we will learn about the vitally useful Information metric known as “entropy.” In contrast to the more familiar “probability” that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, “entropy” quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of a full probability distribution of possible outcomes. Entropy measures, combined with Bayes’ theorem, allow businesses to quantify exactly how much information they can extract from certain data, and how much uncertainty remains. Information measures provide the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. In the Credit Card Business Case Study (Final Course Project), you will re-characterize their own binary classification models for default. An effective model offers customized probabilities of default/no default based on each applicant’s different data. These probabilities informed by data, taken as a whole, have less uncertainty on average than the “base rate” probability of default in the applicant population. The reduction in uncertainty offered by the learner's model-plus-data is known as information gain. It is possible to calculate the exact financial value of new information – in this case, a credit score offered for sale by a predictive analytics firm. This week you will learn how to calculate both the potential information gain from the new data and its cost savings– in effect, determining the incremental financial value to the credit card issuer per bit of information purchased. Linear RegressionWelcome! This week you will be introduced to the most widely used parametric model - in which both signal and noise have a standard, Gaussian probability distribution. Together we will explore the many elegant and useful features of Gaussian parameters, including using them to show the deep relationship between the residual error in a best-fit regression line, the linear correlation measure R, and the “mutual information” between X and Y - how much knowledge of X reduces uncertainty about Y. You will be able to characterize a linear regression estimate as either a “point estimate” or a probability distribution with defined confidence intervals.The Credit Card Business Case Study (Final Course Project) introduces a new output variable – instead of default/no default, the bank is now concerned with the historical profits and losses associated with each customer. Faced with continuous rather than binary outputs, a linear regression model is more appropriate. You will apply multivariate linear regression in Excel to develop a best-fit model for future applicants’ profits and losses. That model has a known error, or uncertainty, and you will place individual forecasts using it in a 90% confidence interval.Samples and Random VariablesWelcome! Did you know that data are often gathered into “bins” to form histograms? This week you’ll learn how to generate histograms with various bin sizes in Excel, and understand how and why histograms can be characterized as “probability histograms”. You will learn the most common ways that probability distributions are described, and the characteristics of the most common standard probability distribution functions. Data often appear to be coming from a process that fits one of these standard forms, whether Gaussian, uniform discrete, or uniform continuous. Together we will further explore the distinction between the apparent correlation for a set of ordered pairs and the idea of the “true” correlation or dependency between underlying processes. All of these ideas are relevant to establishing a model from data samples of limited size. Final Course ProjectWeek 6 contains the Final Course Project and related supplemental materials necessary to successfully complete the project. The Final Course Project consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment. We recommend that you attempt each of the quizzes after the weeks in which the content first appears, and do the peer review assignment at the end of the course. \n                                    ",

How would you describe this relationship? How would you try to visualise and understand it?\n\nStudy real-world connections using algebra and geometry\n\nIn this free online course, we’ll look at a wide spectrum of interesting, and often surprising, mathematical relationships in our everyday world. We’ll be studying inverse relations, which complement direct relationships; power laws that occur in economics, physics and biology; as well as curious applications of the logarithm function. We’ll visualise these real-world interconnections using graph paper and pencil, and also modern graphing software such as GeoGebra and Desmos.\n\nThe functions and graphs in this course help us to make predictions, evaluate actions and test theories about population distributions, the frequencies of common words in texts, scaling laws in biology and much more. We’ll even see some applications to detecting fraud!\n\nExplore inverse and power relationships\n\nIn Week 1 you’ll meet hyperbolas and inverse relations, which are complementary to the direct proportionality that we studied in Maths for Humans: Linear and Quadratic Relations. You’ll learn to represent such relationships algebraically, and understand them geometrically in the Cartesian plane in a direct visual way.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, we’ll look at Zipf’s law and Benford’s law, check out applications in engineering and physics, investigate power relations and higher degree polynomials, and explore allometry in biology. You will see the history, look at lots of examples, and get useful insights into: lifespans, whether exercise really is good for you, the distribution of wealth, and the crazy claw of the Fiddler crab. And lots of other juicy applications of advanced high school mathematics.\n\nGain valuable skills for further study\n\nUnderstanding basic mathematical relationships is vital to many fields of study: biology, engineering, business, economics, political science and design.

The goal is to design artifacts that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user's needs.\n\nThis course is geared toward the novice. It is for learners that have heard about \"user experience\" or \"user interface\" design but don't really know much about these disciplines.\n\nThe course mantra is that “Design is a systematic and data driven process.” Design is systematic because it is based on a set of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.\n\nIn this course the learner is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.\n\nThis means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WelcomeWhat you should know before you start this courseOverview of User Experience DesignIn these lectures we introduce the basic concepts covered in this course.Requirement GatheringThe first step of the design cycle is presented along with techniques that are relevant for understanding the user and tasks. There is also a focus on how to present findings from this phase of the design cycle.Designing AlternativesThe second step of the design cycle is presented. Students are shown how to take the findings from phase 1 (requirement gathering) to design mobile and ubiquitous computing systems that meet the usablility constraints that were identified.PrototypingThe third step of the design cycle is presented. Once the best design is chosen how to we iteratively design models of the system to quickly allow user to interact and provide feedback.EvaluationThe fourth step of the design cycle is presented. Techniques for determining how well the design meets usability constraints and user experience are presented\n                                    ",

This trend is driven by the adoption of Scala as the main programming language for many applications. Scala fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka, and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, Tumblr and also Coursera.\n\nIn this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.\n\nThe course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series programming projects as homework assignments.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n - understand the principles of functional programming,\n - write purely functional programs, using recursion,\n   pattern matching, and higher-order functions,\n - combine functional programming with objects and classes,\n - design immutable data structures,\n - reason about properties of functions,\n - understand generic types for functional programs\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Getting Started + Functions &amp; EvaluationGet up and running with Scala on your computer. Complete an example assignment to familiarize yourself with our unique way of submitting assignments. In this week, we'll learn the difference between functional imperative programming. We step through the basics of Scala; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functions, and recursionHigher Order FunctionsThis week, we'll learn about functions as first-class values, and higher order functions. We'll also learn about Scala's syntax and how it's formally defined. Finally, we'll learn about methods, classes, and data abstraction through the design of a data structure for rational numbers.Data and AbstractionThis week, we'll cover traits, and we'll learn how to organize classes into hierarchies. We'll cover the hierarchy of standard Scala types, and see how to organize classes and traits into packages. Finally, we'll touch upon the different sorts of polymorphism in Scala.Types and Pattern MatchingThis week we'll learn about the relationship between functions and objects in Scala; functions *are* objects! We'll zoom in on Scala's type system, covering subtyping and generics, and moving on to more advanced aspects of Scala's type system like variance. Finally, we'll cover Scala's most widely used data structure, Lists, and one of Scala's most powerful tools, pattern matching.ListsThis week we dive into Lists, the most commonly-used data structure in Scala.CollectionsAfter a deep-dive into Lists, this week we'll explore other data structures; vectors, maps, ranges, arrays, and more. We'll dive into Scala's powerful and flexible for-comprehensions for querying data.\n                                    ",

How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay?  How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners?\n\nTo solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data.  You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.   In addition, as your programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.\n\nThe backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.  And as usual we have our different video series to help tie the content back to its importance in the real world and to provide tiered levels of support to meet your personal needs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to the course and graphsWelcome to the first module in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course.  Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we'll dive right into the technical content and the backbone project, which is your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps!  The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science.  If you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  Ready to begin?  So are we!Class design and simple graph searchThis week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine!Finding shortest paths in weighted graphsIn the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a \"weighted graph\".  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another.Route planning and NP-hard graph problemsIn this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve \"hard\" problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!  End of Course Project ExtensionYou made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.  Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.  \n                                    ",

Imagina además que Google reservase automáticamente la hora que más te acomoda. Ese es el objetivo de la Web Semántica, el que tu computador sea capaz de entender lo que le estás pidiendo y ejecute las acciones necesarias (interactuando automáticamente con otros computadores) para conseguir lo que le pides. Para lograr ese objetivo los computadores deben ser capaces de entender a los personas y máquinas que interactúan en el proceso, para lo cual se necesita de una semántica común. Este es el fin del área de investigación de la Web Semántica. Para que la comunicación entre las personas y computadores funcione a nivel semántico se necesitan tres tecnologías clave: un modelo de datos común (RDF) para leer y escribir en el mismo idioma; un lenguaje de consultas para ese modelo de datos (SPARQL) que permita extraer información; y una lógica que opera sobre esos mismos datos (OWL) para poder razonar sobre ellos. Este curso introducirá los conceptos necesarios para entender estas tecnologías clave. Al finalizar el curso, los participantes serán capaces de entender los conceptos fundamentales de la Web Semántica y sus principales tecnologías, y desarrollar sus propias aplicaciones utilizando las tecnologías de la Web Semántica. Finalmente, los alumnos verán como el objetivo de la Web Semántica no está tan lejos de conseguirse.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Una Introducción a la Web SemánticaLa Web Semántica es un conjunto de tecnologías que permiten a las aplicaciones entenderse entre ellas. Un ejemplo de esto es el poder decirle a nuestra agenda que reserve una hora con un médico especialista y que la acomode en nuestro calendario de forma automática, sin que nosotros tengamos que intervenir. Al final de este curso el alumno será capaz de utilizar tecnologías de la Web Semántica para lograr ese objetivo, logrando que sus propias aplicaciones puedan interpretar automáticamente el contenido de una página web, hacer que sus aplicaciones se entiendan entre ellas o que esas mismas aplicaciones razonen automáticamente acerca de los datos que ellas generan. Al finalizar este módulo los alumnos serán capaces de desarrollar páginas web cuyos contenidos sean entendidos por los grandes jugadores de Internet: Google, Bing, Yahoo y Yandex.El vocabulario RDFSAl finalizar este módulo el alumno será capaz de describir los datos a los cuales accede su aplicación, de tal forma que ésta aplicación será capaz de razonar acerca de los datos que maneja. Es decir; la aplicación del alumno será capaz de identificar automáticamente si un dato representa a una persona o a un auto a partir de las descripciones existentes en esos datos. Para lograr este objetivo, el módulo introducirá a los alumnos el vocabulario RDFS, clave en el razonamiento automático sobre datos en la Web Semántica.El lenguaje de consulta SPARQL 1.0En este módulo el alumno será capaz de utilizar los operadores principales del lenguaje de consulta SPARQL para acceder a datos almacenados en la Web. Multitud de organizaciones (desde la fundación Wikipedia a Best Buy) hacen accesibles sus datos en la web a través del lenguaje SPARQL (y los llamados SPARQL endpoints). Al finalizar este módulo los alumnos sabrán cómo acceder a esos datos utilizando SPARQL desde sus aplicaciones.El lenguaje OWL para especificar ontologíasUtilizando el Web Ontology Language (OWL), presentado en este módulo, las aplicaciones desarrolladas por el alumno serán capaces de utilizar mecanismos de razonamiento automático. Para esto el lenguaje OWL provee de un vocabulario que permite describir desde relaciones transitivas a relaciones existenciales entre los datos y así generar nuevo conocimiento a partir de los ya existentes de forma automática. El lenguaje de consulta SPARQL 1.1SPARQL 1.1 es la última versión del lenguaje de consulta para acceder a datos almacenados en la Web. En este módulo el alumno trabajará con los nuevos operadores que ofrece esta versión del lenguaje de consulta, en concreto con los operadores de razonamiento, agregados y acceso a múltiples SPARQL endpoints desde una misma consulta. Así, el alumno será capaz al finalizar el módulo de proveer aplicaciones de datos mucho más ricas.Traducción de datos a RDF utilizando la noción de direct-mappingEn este módulo el alumno aplicará las tecnologías para traducir datos relacionales a RDF, y así hacer esos datos accesibles a una mayor cantidad de aplicaciones externas. Existen dos tecnologías para realizar esta traducción, RDB to RDF Mapping Language (R2RML) y Direct Mapping. El alumno verá los conceptos asociados a ambas tecnologías y aplicará el Direct Mapping para traducir una base de datos relacional a RDF.Aplicaciones de la Web SemánticaExisten muchas aplicaciones exitosas de las tecnologías de la Web Semántica en el mundo real. El alumno verá dos de ellas en este módulo: una aplicación en la cual se accede a datos biológicos como son datos del genoma humano, del ratón o publicaciones científicas y se transforman a RDF para así facilitar el descubrimiento de nueva información (Bio2RDF). La segunda aplicación de tecnologías de la Web Semántica modela datos sobre leyes chilenas en RDF, proveyendo un acceso fácil a esos datos legislativos.\n                                    ",

The term \"software diagnosis\" refers to recently innovated techniques from automated software analysis and software visual analytics that aim at giving insights into information about complex software system implementations, the correlated software development processes, and the system evolution. To this end, all common, traditionally separated infomation sources of software development get automatically extracted, related, and combined. The ultimate goals of these techniques are to provide not only software engineers but also all other stakeholders better instruments to monitor, to comprehend, to discuss, and to steer software development activities. In particular we will investigate how \"software maps\" as cartography-oriented, general-purpose, powerful visual analytics instruments can be used to improve software development effectiveness and transparency.\r\nAs precondition, our interested learners for this course shall have general knowledge about software development processes and procedures and have experience in IT-systems development or software maintenance.

Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:\n\nOverview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)\n\tTransformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)\n\tOpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)\n\tRaytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)\nThis term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the format of the class?\n\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. \n\nYour score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.\n\nProgramming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.\n\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\n\nYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\n\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\n\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.\n\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\n\nNothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.\n\nWhat computer system do I need for the course?\n\nThe course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.\n\nWill I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?\n\nThis is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.\n\nCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\n\nYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.\n\nI have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?\n\nIn most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.\n\nI have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?\n\nThe course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.\n\n \n\n                                    ",

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.\r\nThe course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.\r\nAn optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.\r\nI hope you enjoy the course!\r\nWHY STUDY COMPILERS?\r\nEverything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.\n\n                                    ",

All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software.\n\nIn this new and improved version of the course, you will learn to write software with a progressive hint system for first time programmers. The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few “lines of code,” but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches you to write good programs.\n\nThe course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.\n\nThroughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems to provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the Codeboard;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich). \n\nBeyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today’s IT-based world possible.\n\nIn this third edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises.\n\n\"Really good course. Followed it with a couple of experienced colleagues all of them having a computer science background. They really liked the concepts and programming in Eiffel a lot.

In other words, however secure the Operating System, Compilers and Applications be, if the hardware on which these thrive is not secure, then the entire system can be compromised. The security of the system is a collective responsibility of Hardware and Software.

The Computational Geometry taught in this course is derived from classical discrete/combinatorial geometry and modern computer science.\n\nComputational Geometry first appeared on the horizon when M. I. Shamos presented his Ph.D. dissertation in 1978. Since then, this phrase has been used to refer to algorithmic study on discrete and combinatorial geometric structures and can also be regarded as the geometric version of Algorithm Design and Analysis. Computational Geometry is now considered the basis of robotics, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAM and CID), and geographic information systems (GIS).\n\n                                    ",

Colors have different symbolism depending on cultural norms. And to accommodate all these differences, you want to do everything you possibly can to avoid the colossal effort of redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every market.\n\nThis computer science course focuses on two aspects of “world-ready” design. The first is globalization: making the user experience and the code that implements it generic enough to accommodate most market differences. The second aspect is localization: customizing features for the local market. The more globalized your design, the easier it is to localize.\n\nThe course instructors include designers and programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience is one all your customers will enjoy, regardless of where they’re from or what language they speak.\n\nPrevious programming or User Experience design experience is always helpful, but not necessary for this course. Completion of “Developing International Software” is also helpful, but not essential.\n\n                                    ",

Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors.In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of message-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Review of Principles of Functional Programming: substitution model, for-expressions and how they relate to monads. Introduces a new implementation of for-expressions: random value generators. Shows how this can be used in randomized testing and gives an overview of ScalaCheck, a tool which implements this idea.Week 2: Functional programming and mutable state. What makes an object mutable? How this impacts the substitution model. Extended example: Digital circuit simulation.Week 3: Futures. Introduces futures as another monad, with for-expressions as concrete syntax. Shows how futures can be composed to avoid thread blocking. Discusses cross-thread error handling.Week 4: Reactive stream processing.  Generalizing futures to reactive computations over streams. Stream operators.Week 5: Actors. Introduces the Actor Model, actors as encapsulated units of consistency, asynchronous message passing, discusses different message delivery semantics (at most once, at least once, exactly once) and eventual consistency.Week 6: Supervision. Introduces reification of failure, hierarchical failure handling, the Error Kernel pattern, lifecycle monitoring, discusses transient and persistent state.Week 7: Conversation Patterns. Discusses the management of conversational state between actors and patterns for flow control, routing of messages to pools of actors for resilience or load balancing, acknowledgement of reception to achieve reliable delivery.\n                                    ",

As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages.\nThe course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students.\nAn optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java.I hope you enjoy the course!\nWhy Study Compilers?\nEverything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.\n\n\n                                    ",

An ever increasing number of data sources, driven by individuals and organizations, contribute to this data deluge by sharing their data with others. However, data is locked up behind proprietary, unreliable, and even unstable programming interfaces that prevent us from optimally making use of it.

They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis. (Ph.D. support might be available at CEMPI in Lille or at the Faculty of Mathematics of National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow)\n\n                                    ",

Latest hardware and software trends led to the development of a new revolutionary database technology that enables flexible and lightning-fast analysis of massive amounts of enterprise data. The basic concepts and design principles of this technology are explained in detail. Beyond that, the implications of the underlying design principles for future enterprise applications and their development are discussed. The course will explain in detail the differences and advantages of an in-memory column-oriented database in contrast to traditional row-oriented disk-based storages. The following topics are covered (among others):\r\n\r\nRequirements for Modern Enterprise Computing, Enterprise Application Characteristics\r\nHardware Trends, Columnar Storage vs. Row Storage\r\nDictionary Encoding, Compression\r\nScans, Selects, Deletes, Inserts, Updates\r\nIndices, Joins\r\nApplications\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 1: The first week will give you an understanding of origins of enterprise computing. It is vital to know the historic development which lead to the emergence of current hardware as we know it now in order to understand the decisions made in the past. Many characteristics of current applications, like materialized aggregates and a reduction of detail in the stored information, have their roots in the past. While these measures were helpful in former systems, they form an obstacle which has to be overcome now in order to allow for new, dynamic applications.\r\nWeek 2: Within the second week, the differences between a horizontal, row oriented layout and a columnar layout are discussed. Concepts like compression and partitioning are introduced. Based on that, you will get an explanation of the internal steps performed inside the database to carry out the fundamental relational operations insert, update and delete. The week concludes with a fundamental difference of SanssouciDB to most other databases: the insert only approach. Following this concept, we circumvent several pitfalls concerning referential integrity and additionally gain the foundation for a gap-less time travel feature.\r\nWeek 3: The content of week 3 focuses on more advanced structures and operations within the database. The differential buffer, a means to prevent frequent resorting of the dictionaries and rewriting of the attribute vectors, is explained in further detail. Subsequently, also the merge process, which incorporates the changes from the differential buffer into the main store, is illustrated. The retrieval of information via the select statement, as well as related concepts like tuple reconstruction, early and late materialization, or a closer examination of the achieved scan speed, are also part of this week's schedule. The description of the join operation, which is used to connect information from different tables, concludes this week.\r\nWeek 4: Week 4 is all about aggregation. Aggregations are the centerpiece of every business analytics application. Given that huge impact of aggregates on all parts of a business, it is of great importance to understand what aggregate functions are, why we remove all materialized aggregates and go for aggregation on the fly. You will further learn how to greatly reduce the costs of this on demand approach by using the aggregate cache and understand its connection to the differential buffer and the merge process. In the units concluding this week, you will see new prototype applications using the aggregate cache to deliver complex simulations in real time.\r\nWeek 5: Week 5 sheds light on some more inner mechanisms of the database. What happens in emergency situations, when for example the power is turned off? Logging and recovery are vital parts to know in order to understand why an in-memory database is as secure as a traditional disk based one. Further, the benefits of replicas are explained. We conclude the week with an outlook onto the implications that arise with the tremendously increased speed at hands.\r\nWeek 6: Week 6 is centered on applications. The last conceptual unit is about data separation into active and passive. After that, we showcase several prototypes and sketch out potential fields to apply the technology, thereby also leaving the domain of pure enterprise solutions, by using main memory databases in weather simulations and medicine.\r\nExam: The final exam will cover all content from the previous weeks and test your understanding of the course as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ",

A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images is undertaken over the entire term. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making will be emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation.\n\nTopics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined. New forms of cameras and imaging paradigms will be introduced.Why Take This Course?You will undertake a hands-on approach over the entire term using computational techniques, merged with digital imaging processes to produce photographic artifacts. In addition to understanding how various elements of the computational photography pipeline function together to produce novel - and sometimes stunning - results, you will be given ample opportunity to appreciate and critique artifacts produced/curated by your peers.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Please refer to the [course schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AqyqgGWSjCbpdFFqWXJiZ01vNW15UXlwaUtTZE84MWc&amp;output=html) for detailed syllabus set to a suggested timeline for Spring 2015, along with assignment due dates and additional materials.\n\nHere is a brief outline of the topics covered:\n\n### Module 1 - Introduction\n- Introduction\n- What is Computational Photography\n- Dual Photography\n- Panorama\n- Why Study Computational Photography\n\n### Module 2 - Digital Imaging\n- What is a Digital Image\n- Point Processes\n- Smoothing\n- Blending Modes\n- Convolution and Cross-Correlation\n- Gradients\n- Edges\n\n### Module 3 - Cameras\n- Cameras\n- Lenses\n- Exposure\n- Sensor\n\n### Module 4 - Comp Vision to Comp Photo\n- Fourier Transform\n- Blending\n- Pyramids\n- Cuts\n- Features\n\n### Module 5 - Applications\n- Panorama\n- HDR\n- Time Lapse\n- Procam Systems\n- Mosaics\n\n### Module 6 - Light Field\n- Lightfield\n- Lightfield Camera\n\n### Module 7 - Blur / De-Blur\n- Lucy-Richardon Blur\n- Flutter Shutter\n\n### Module 8 - Video\n- Video\n- Video Textures\n- Video Stabilization\n\n### Module 9 - Closing Thoughts\n\n---\nFurther resources:\n\n- [Spring 2015 course website](https://www.udacity.com/admin/tools/content-editor#!/c-ud955): Course information, assignments, academic policies, grading scheme.\n- [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/i4fj9alolja61a): Discussions, announcements, clarifications.\n- [T-Square site](https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-cd36-2625-55b0-b0e6-d1c0d4eb36af): Assignment submissions.\n                                    ",

We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionCourse introduction and overview, the roles of abstraction and implementation in systems design, the road ahead.Boolean Functions and Gate LogicWe will start with a brief introduction of Boolean algebra, and learn how Boolean functions can be physically implemented using logic gates. We will then learn how to specify gates and chips using a Hardware Description Language (HDL), and how to simulate the behaviour of the resulting chip specifications using a hardware simulator. This background will set the stage for Project 1, in which you will build, simulate, and test 15 elementary logic gates. The chipset that you will build this module will be later used to construct the computer's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and memory system. This will be done in modules 2 and 3, respectively.General Course InformationGeneral Course InformationBoolean Arithmetic and the ALUUsing the chipset that we've built in the previous module, we will now proceed to build a family of adders -- chips designed to add numbers. We will then take a big step forward and build an Arithmetic Logic Unit. The ALU, which is designed to perform a whole set of arithmetic and logical operations, is the computer's calculating brain. Later in the course we will use this ALU as the centerpiece chip from which we will build the computer's Central Processing Unit, or CPU. Since all these chips operate on binary numbers (0's and 1's), we will start this module with a general overview of binary arithmetic, and only then delve into building the ALU.MemoryHaving built the computer's ALU, this module we turn to building the computer's main memory unit, also known as Random Access Memory, or RAM. This will be done gradually, going bottom-up from elementary flip-flop gates to one-bit registers to n-bit registers to a family of RAM chips. Unlike the computer's processing chips, which are based on combinational logic, the computer's memory logic requires a clock-based sequential logic. We will start with an overview of this theoretical background, and then move on to build our memory chipset.Machine LanguageA critically important aspect of building a new computer system is designing the low-level machine language, or instruction set, with which the computer can be instructed to do various things. As it turns out, this can be done before the computer itself is actually built. For example, we can write a Java program that emulates the yet-to-be-built computer, and then use it to emulate the execution of programs written in the new machine language. Such experiments can give us a good appreciation of the bare bone \"look and feel\" of the new computer, and lead to decisions that may well change and improve both the hardware and the language designs. Taking a similar approach, in this module we assume that the Hack computer and machine language have been built, and write some low-level programs using the Hack machine language. We will then use a supplied CPU Emulator (a computer program) to test and execute our programs. This experience will give you a taste of low-level programming, as well as a solid hands-on overview of the Hack computer platform.Computer ArchitectureLet's recap the last four modules: we've built some elementary logic gates (module 1), and then used them to build an ALU (module 2) and a RAM (module 3). We then played with low-level programming (module 4), assuming that the overall computer is actually available. In this module we assemble all these building blocks into a general-purpose 16-bit computer called Hack. We will start by building the Hack Central Processing Unit (CPU), and we will then integrate the CPU with the RAM, creating a full-blown computer system capable of executing programs written in the Hack machine language.AssemblerEvery computer has a binary machine language, in which instructions are written as series of 0's and 1's, and a symbolic machine language, also known as assembly language, in which instructions are expressed using human-friendly mnemonics. Both languages do exactly the same thing, and are completely equivalent. But, writing programs in assembly is far easier and safer then writing in binary. In order to enjoy this luxury, someone has to translate our symbolic programs into binary code that can execute as-is on the target computer. This translation service is done by an agent called assembler. The assembler can be either a person who carries out the translation manually, or a computer program that automates the process. In this module and final project in the course we learn how to build an assembler. In particular, we'll develop the capability of translating symbolic Hack programs into binary code that can be executed as-is on the Hack platform. Each one of you can choose to accomplish this feat in two different ways: you can either implement an assembler using a high-level language, or you can simulate the assembler's operation using paper and pencil. In both cases we give detailed guidelines about how to carry out your work.\n                                    ",

Upon completing the course, students will understand the vulnerabilities in current digital system design flow and the physical attacks to these systems. They will learn that security starts from hardware design and be familiar with the tools and skills to build secure and trusted hardware.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Digital System Design: Basics and VulnerabilitiesTo learn hardware security, we first need to learn how hardware is designed. This week's lectures give an overview of the basics on digital logic design, which is a semester-long course for freshmen and sophomores in most schools. By no means we can cover all the materials. What we provide here is the minimal set that you need to understand about digital design for you to move on to learn hardware security. Design Intellectual Property ProtectionAs a hardware designer or a company, you want to protect your design intellectual property (IP) from being misused (by users, competitors, silicon foundry, etc). We will cover how you can build such protection during the design process which can be used as an evidence to support law enforcement protection.  You are expected to understand the basic digital logic design knowledge covered in week 1. We will use several NP-hard problems as examples to illustrate the concepts of IP protection. These problems (graph vertex coloring problem and graph partitioning problem) will be introduced in the lecture and you do not need to know the concept of NP-complete. \nPhysical Attacks and Modular ExponentiationThis week you will learn the fundamentals about physical attacks: what are physical attacks, who are the attackers, what are their motivations, how can they attack your system (from hardware), what kind of skills/tools/equipment they should need to break your system, etc. You will also see what are the available countermeasures. You will learn how system security level and tamper resistance level are defined and some general guidelines on how to make your system secure by design. \n\nIn the second part, you will learn a useful mathematical operation called modular exponentiation. It is widely used in modern cryptography but it is very computational expensive. You will see how security vulnerability might be introduced during the implementation of this operation and thus make the mathematically sound cryptographic primitives breakable. This will also be important for you to learn side channel attack next week.Side Channel Attacks and CountermeasuresThis week, we focus on side channel attacks (SCA). We will study in-depth the following SCAs: cache attacks, power analysis, timing attacks, scan chain attacks. We will also learn the available countermeasures from software, hardware, and algorithm design.  Hardware Trojan Detection and Trusted IC DesignThis week we study hardware Trojan and trusted integrated circuit (IC) design. Hardware Trojans are additions or modifications of the circuit with malicious purposes. It has become one of the most dangerous and challenging threats for trusted ID design. We will give hardware Trojan taxonomies based on different criteria, explain how hardware Trojan work, and then talk about some of the existing approaches to detect them. We define trusted IC as circuit that does exactly what it is asked for, no less and no malicious more. We will illustrate this concept through the design space analysis and we will discuss several practical hardware Trojan prevention methods that can facilitate trust IC design. Good Practice and Emerging TechnologiesThis is the last week and we will cover some positive things on hardware security. We start with trust platform module (TPM), followed by physical unclonable functin (PUF), and FPGA-based system design. We conclude with a short discussion on the roles that hardware play in security and trust.  Final Exam \n                                    ",

We will first look at the history of the Internet and Web, followed by a look at how the network works and then examine how we secure information on the Internet and Web.History: Dawn of Electronic ComputingWorld War II emphasized the strategic importance of computation, communication, and information.  There was unprecedented investment in the development of new technologies during the war.  We start with Alan Turing and others at Bletchley Park.History: The First Internet - NSFNetIn the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great deal of research done to build the first wide-area packet switched networks for the US Department of Defense.  In the 1980s, the first “Internet” was formed to allow academic researchers to access supercomputer resources.History: The Web Makes it Easy to UseThe World-Wide-Web was invented in 1990 but it was not an overnight success.  But by 1994 - “the year of the web” - the web was being widely used and Internet usage was growing by leaps and bounds.History: Commercialization and GrowthThe late 1990’s saw the web and Internet used increasingly to revolutionize how business was done.  Companies like Amazon were founded and grew very rapidly.Technology: Internets and PacketsThe Internet is designed based on a four-layer model.  Each layer builds on the layers below it.  The Link and Internetwork layers are the lowest layers of that model.Technology: Transport Control Protocol (TCP)The Transport layer is built on the Internetwork layer and is what makes our network connections reliable.Technology: Application ProtocolsWith reliable “pipes” available from the Transport layer, we can build applications like web browsers, file transfer applications, or email clients and servers.Security: Encrypting and SigningUsing simple examples, we examing how to shield data from prying eyes and make sure that the data was not altered while in transit.Security: Web SecurityWe apply the basic ideas of encryption and signing to who we actually secure the connections that we use on today’s Web and Internet.Final Exam \n                                    ",

How does Google order its search results from the trillions of webpages on the Internet? Why does Verizon charge $15 for every GB of data we use? Is it really true that we are connected in six social steps or less?\n\nThese are just a few of the many intriguing questions we can ask about the social and technical networks that form integral parts of our daily lives. This course is about exploring the answers, using a language that anyone can understand. We will focus on fundamental principles like “sharing is hard”, “crowds are wise”, and “network of networks” that have guided the design and sustainability of today’s networks, and summarize the theories behind everything from the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook to the technology upon which these websites run.\n\nUnlike other networking courses, the mathematics included here are no more complicated than adding and multiplying numbers. While mathematical details are necessary to fully specify the algorithms and systems we investigate, they are not required to understand the main ideas. We use illustrations, analogies, and anecdotes about networks as pedagogical tools in lieu of detailed equations.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionAn introduction to what this course is about: the fundamentals behind social and technical networks.Power Control in Cellular NetworksHow is it possible that we can all communicate effectively without disrupting each other's calls, messages, or Internet usage? In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the methods that have been developed for letting us \"share\" the air over which our phones communicate.Random Access in Wifi NetworksIn this lesson, we will investigate WiFi, another type of wireless network. Rather than having stringent power control algorithms as we saw for cellular, WiFi relies on \"random access\" methods to manage interference among users in the same location.PageRank by GoogleIn this lesson, we will take a look at PageRank, Google's famous algorithm for ordering the results on its search page. PageRank is a prime example of how coming up with the right \"ranking\" of a set of items is a difficult yet important question in networking.Product Rating on AmazonThe decision of whether or not to purchase something online is often driven by the ratings that previous customers have left for it. In this lesson, we will take a look at Amazon's review system, and the see how \"crowds are wise\" is another important networking principle.Movie Recommendation on NetflixOne of the perks of having a Netflix subscription is getting recommendations of movies to watch. Behind the scenes, Netflix uses powerful algorithms to determine which will be suggested to each person specifically. In this lesson, we will take a look at the main ideas behind these algorithms.MidtermViral Videos on YouTubeWhat does it take for a video to become \"viral\" on YouTube? In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the key factors and models that have been used to explain this phenomenon. At the core is the notion of information cascade in a network, which is the counterpart to the wisdom of crowds.Influencing People in Social NetworksIn this lesson, we will continue with our theme of influence, now paying more attention to people's social networks. We will discuss different ways of measuring importance and a popular model for influence spread in social networks like Facebook and Twitter.   Pricing DataData makes up a significant part of our cell phone bills. How do cellular providers set these price points? In this lesson, we will see how so-called usage-based pricing schemes can send better signals than flat- rate, “buffet” schemes, leading to better sharing of the network. Routing Traffic through the InternetIt is hard to overstate the impact that the Internet has had on society. In this lesson, we will overview the  fundamental concepts behind the way the Internet is designed. We will also take a look at routing, which is the process of determining how packets of information are transported.Controlling Congestion in the InternetThe Internet has many important tasks to manage, like routing packets (discussed in the last module) and controlling congestion. This workload is modularized into different functional layers, each responsible for performing a different set of functions, as we will see in this lesson. We will also look at the principles of congestion control, managed at the transport layer.It's a Small WorldSix degrees of separation is a widely told story in popular science. How can it still be a \"small world\" with the enormity of the Internet today? It depends on how the social networks are structured, and on how we search for short paths, as we will see in this lesson.Final ExamThe final covers the last six lessons in the course (those after the midterm). Like the midterm, the questions are all multiple choice, and tend to be easier than the homework questions but harder than the in-video quizzes.\n                                    ",

We will start by introducing the complex plane, along with the algebra and geometry of complex numbers, and then we will make our way via differentiation, integration, complex dynamics, power series representation and Laurent series into territories at the edge of what is known today. Each module consists of five video lectures with embedded quizzes, followed by an electronically graded homework assignment.  Additionally, modules 1, 3, and 5 also contain a peer assessment. \n \nThe homework assignments will require time to think through and practice the concepts discussed in the lectures. In fact, a significant amount of your learning will happen while completing the homework assignments. These assignments are not meant to be completed quickly; rather you'll need paper and pen with you to work through the questions. In total, we expect that the course will take 6-12 hours of work per module, depending on your background.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to Complex NumbersWe’ll begin this module by briefly learning about the history of complex numbers: When and why were they invented? In particular, we’ll look at the rather surprising fact that the original need for complex numbers did not arise from the study of quadratic equations (such as solving the equation z^2+1 = 0), but rather from the study of cubic equations!  Next we’ll cover some algebra and geometry in the complex plane to learn how to compute with and visualize complex numbers. To that end we’ll also learn about the polar representation of complex numbers, which will lend itself nicely to finding roots of complex numbers. We’ll finish this module by looking at some topology in the complex plane.Complex Functions and IterationComplex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, that is, functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. The main goal of this module is to familiarize ourselves with such functions. Ultimately we’ll want to study their smoothness properties (that is, we’ll want to differentiate complex functions of complex variables), and we therefore need to understand sequences of complex numbers as well as limits in the complex plane. We’ll use quadratic polynomials as an example in the study of complex functions and take an excursion into the beautiful field of complex dynamics by looking at the iterates of certain quadratic polynomials.  This allows us to learn about the basics of the construction of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials. You'll learn everything you need to know to create your own beautiful fractal images, if you so desire. We’ll finish this module by defining and looking at the Mandelbrot set and one of the biggest outstanding conjectures in the field of complex dynamics.Analytic FunctionsWhen studying functions we are often interested in their local behavior, more specifically, in how functions change as their argument changes. This leads us to studying complex differentiation – a more powerful concept than that which we learned in calculus. We’ll begin this module by reviewing some facts from calculus and then learn about complex differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations in order to meet the main players: analytic functions. These are functions that possess complex derivatives in lots of places; a fact, which endows them with some of the most beautiful properties mathematics has to offer. We’ll finish this module with the study of some functions that are complex differentiable, such as the complex exponential function and complex trigonometric functions. These functions agree with their well-known real-valued counterparts on the real axis!Conformal MappingsWe’ll begin this module by studying inverse functions of analytic functions such as the complex logarithm (inverse of the exponential) and complex roots (inverses of power) functions. In order to possess a (local) inverse, an analytic function needs to have a non-zero derivative, and we’ll discover the powerful fact  that at any such place an analytic function preserves angles between curves and is therefore a conformal mapping! We'll spend two lectures talking about very special conformal mappings, namely Möbius transformations; these are some of the most fundamental mappings in geometric analysis. We'll finish this module with the famous and stunning Riemann mapping theorem. This theorem allows us to study arbitrary simply connected sub-regions of the complex plane by transporting geometry and complex analysis from the unit disk to those domains via conformal mappings, the existence of which is guaranteed via the Riemann Mapping Theorem.Complex IntegrationNow that we are familiar with complex differentiation and analytic functions we are ready to tackle integration. But we are in the complex plane, so what are the objects we’ll integrate over? Curves! We’ll begin this module by studying curves (“paths”) and next get acquainted with the complex path integral. Then we’ll learn about Cauchy’s beautiful and all encompassing integral theorem and formula.  Next we’ll study some of the powerful consequences of these theorems, such as Liouville’s Theorem, the Maximum Principle and, believe it or not, we’ll be able to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra using Complex Analysis. It's going to be a week filled with many amazing results!Power SeriesIn this module we’ll learn about power series representations of analytic functions. We’ll begin by studying infinite series of complex numbers and complex functions as well as their convergence properties. Power series are especially easy to understand, well behaved and easy to work with. We’ll learn that every analytic function can be locally represented as a power series, which makes it possible to approximate analytic functions locally via polynomials. As a special treat, we'll explore the Riemann zeta function, and we’ll make our way into territories at the edge of what is known today such as the Riemann hypothesis and its relation to prime numbers.Laurent Series and the Residue TheoremLaurent series are a powerful tool to understand analytic functions near their singularities. Whereas power series with non-negative exponents can be used to represent analytic functions in disks, Laurent series (which can have negative exponents) serve a similar purpose in annuli. We’ll begin this module by introducing Laurent series and their relation to analytic functions and then continue on to the study and classification of isolated singularities of analytic functions. We’ll encounter some powerful and famous theorems such as the Theorem of Casorati-Weierstraß and Picard’s Theorem, both of which serve to better understand the behavior of an analytic function near an essential singularity. Finally we’ll be ready to tackle the Residue Theorem, which has many important applications. We’ll learn how to find residues and evaluate some integrals (even some real integrals on the real line!) via this important theorem.Final ExamCongratulations for having completed the seven weeks of this course! This module contains the final exam for the course. The exam is cumulative and covers the topics discussed in Weeks 1-7. The exam has 20 questions and is designed to be a two-hour exam. You have one attempt only, but you do not have to complete the exam within two hours. The discussion forum will stay open during the exam. It is against the honor code to discuss answers to any exam question on the forum. The forum should only be used to discuss questions on other material or to alert staff of technical issues with the exam. \n                                    ",

We will review topics in dental medicine including scope of the field, what to expect in function, and some of the many ways that dysfunction may present for different patients. This will include discussions of mouth, jaw, and tooth anatomy, pathology, and treatment. We will talk about differences between patients and the unique roles that different members of the dental field may play in treatment depending on the patient and condition. This course starts from basic concepts and proceeds to review trends in current research and technology.

We will use case examples and live demonstrations with patients to illustrate these points. Please note that some lectures in this course contain graphic medical images, including illustrations of the human body, oral cavity, early development, and photographs of medical conditions and deformities. Discretion is advised. The materials in this course are intended for education purposes only and are not intended to serve as professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please seek the advice of your dentist, physician, or other qualified health professional if you have any questions related to this material and its relevance to your health or that of someone else. Week 1 is your introduction to dental medicine! This includes oral health's relation to general health, sources of infection, modern technology in dentistry, and the public health impact of dental medicine. Let's get started!Week 2 - Form and Function of the Oral CavityThe modules in week 2 describe basic dental anatomy including embryology of the oral cavity, oral functions, basic tooth structure, and clinical implications of disease. Emphasis is placed on the clinical implications of these concepts and structures.Week 3 - Comprehensive Evaluation of Dental Patient NeedsThese modules will demonstrate the evaluation of extra- and intraoral structures. They also review the taking of a thorough medical history, with live patient demonstrations. This unit emphasizes the complex relationship between the systemic and oral health.Week 4 - Most Common Dental Diseases Affecting Teeth and PeriodontiumDiseases affecting the dentition and its surrounding structures have a profound influence on the patient and his/her health. Untreated conditions can result in severe pain, localized, and systemic infections and result in partial or complete loss of teeth.The etiology and the contributing factors to these diseases are discussed in detail.Week 5 - Oral Mucosal Conditions: Diagnosis and ManagementPossible oral and mucosal conditions include anomalies, ulcers, cancer and associated diseases. Some of these conditions have localized or idiopathic etiology; others are manifestations of systemic diseases of the body. Many times these oral conditions appear as the initial symptom of a systemic disease. The management of such conditions often involves an interdisciplinary approach to management involving the patient's dentist, physician, and medical specialists.Week 6 - The Science of Pain Affecting the Intraoral and Extraoral StructuresThese modules address oral and facial pain from common conditions to rare ones, including an exploration of the psychological aspects of oral and facial pain. Dental pain can originate not only from diseased dentition, but also from various disorders affecting the TMJ, nerves, soft and hard tissue infections and other sources. Dental pain can have underlying psychosocial etiology as well, and the diagnosis in such cases can be challenging.Week 7 - Overview of Dental Specialties: Scope and Modalities of TreatmentSelected cases in dental medicine ranging from oral surgery to prosthetic reconstruction are discussed in the context of the important role of dental specialists. Each presenter discusses the challenges of focused dental treatment and presents cases with \"before\" and \"after\" documentation.\n                                    ",

The latest graphics and animations will help you to find new insights and understanding of this part of the body, that has been the focus of anatomical research for centuries and presently arouses renewed scientific interest.\n\nYou will explore the 3D anatomy of the organs from a basic level, providing thorough anatomical understanding, to its advanced application in surgical procedures. This course will challenge you to discover and help you to understand the anatomy of the abdomen and pelvis in all its aspects, ranging from its embryological underpinnings, via digital microscopy to gross topography and its clinical applications.\n\nThe course is unique in that it continuously connects basic anatomical knowledge from the lab with its medical applications and current diagnostic techniques. You’ll get the chance to discuss anatomical and clinical problems with peers and experts in forum discussions and you will receive guidance in exploring the wealth of anatomical information that has been gathered over the centuries. Follow us on an exciting journey through the abdomen and pelvis where you digest your food but also where new life starts!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Mapping the abdomen and pelvisWelcome to the first week of the course. Have you ever wondered what lies inside your abdomen? Do you know where the spleen or appendix is situated? Would you like to know how the physician looks at it and get the basics of a physical examination of the abdomen? Do you want to understand how all these structures can be seen on scans or X-rays? During this week you will get a better understanding of these things. We also lay the foundation for the following weeks of the course, like basic things to know about vascularization, the nervous system, embryology, and the wonderful membrane holding all these structures together: the peritoneum.Trip into the gutAfter the first introduction of the abdomen with all its organs, this week we will focus at some microscopy and the first stages of gut development in the embryo. The gut starts as a simple straight tube which differentiates further into a internalized tract with specialized sections, each with its own function. You will learn how the esophagus transports your food, while its lower sphincter prevents food from returning - even if you're upside down! Then you will focus on how the stomach drenches all food in an extremely acid pool, attacking ingested bacteria and starting the digestion. That same acid would also damage the duodenum, so protective action is required. You will follow the digestion further down the tract, with its extensive folds and specialized cells and end up with more and more solid bowel contents when water is extracted in the colon. In order to demonstrate some functions further, we also have to dive into the world of microscopy. Join us on this trip into the gut with all its ingenious structural specializations along the way!The gut and its 'suppliers and purchasers'We discussed some microscopy before and the embryonic origin of the initial gut tube and how it differentiates into specialized sections for digestion. We will now focus on the question why the bowels are not arranged symmetrically left and right, like in the rest of our body, but are closely encircling and crossing over each other. With a unique 3D animation you will learn about the rotation of the gut during development. This key concept will help you to understand the anatomical relationships of the gut with its suppliers and purchasers. The gut cannot do it alone; it needs additional organs which supply digestive chemicals such as enzymes and bile and organs that process the absorbed food further. Both the gut and these organs also need a blood supply. You will learn where their blood vessels are situated. Also, the less prominent, but very important 'sewage' system, the lymphatics, will be dealt with. In the gut area, the lymphatics are specialized in transporting fats that are absorbed from the food! Lymphatic vessels also keep an eye on pathological invaders. Unfortunately they may also spread tumor cells. In short, this week's module is for everyone who is interested in the collaboration between the abdominal organs and the gut.Knowing your peritoneal relationshipsYou have already learned that the bowels are not arranged symmetrically left and right. The rotation processes of the gut and its suppliers have important consequences for the peritoneal coverings of the gut and the abdominal wall. It determines why some structures lie easily accessible in the abdomen and others are more hidden away. In this week you will get a grip on difficult concepts as 'intraperitoneal' and 'retroperitoneal'. It is also a starter week about abdominal surgery. You will also learn a secret: The best way to mobilize the abdominal and pelvic organs is to separate what got adhered when the patient was just an embryo! Please feel free to dive into these embryonic matters and enjoy all the twists and turns!Protecting the internal organsThe abdominal body wall and the pelvis are the topics of this week. What happens if you push hard to pass a stool, or in reverse, how do you prevent unwantedly passing a stool when you sneeze or cough hard? It may not seem the most attractive area of the body, but the rectum and anus hold many intricacies and even nowadays new things are discovered! Weak areas in the body wall are a frequent cause of problems, for instance they can lead to inguinal hernias. You will learn about their complicated anatomy. And finally, we will dive deep in the pelvis and learn about its hidden gems: the internal genitals.Pain!The course comes to an end with this last topic: Pain in my belly! Probably all of us have experienced abdominal pains and have witnessed its many different forms. Sometimes it can just be a slight discomfort, or it can come in waves of agony. The aches can develop gradually over several days, or strike suddenly as severe abdominal pain. In many cases the patient cannot easily locate the pain. Even shoulder pain can be caused by something going on in the abdomen! Abdominal pain is one of the most frequent reasons to seek medical attention. However, diagnosing the cause of the pain can be very difficult. Many different diseases may cause abdominal pain. Many of those do not require immediate treatment, yet others are life-threatening. The challenge is to correctly identify those dangerous cases that require prompt surgical intervention. You will learn the anatomical basis of pain and how to apply this knowledge in the diagnostic process. We will wrap up with an overview of several abdominal diseases that might all present themselves with pain.Concluding the MOOC\n                                    ",

With the current surge of veterans reintegrating into civilian society it is critical to improve the training of the next cadre of providers who will provide care for our veterans.  It is widely known that veterans receive care in all aspects of the health system, thus providers in  veteran focused care facilities, military health serves and civilian locals must be aware of the unique needs of veterans.  It is perhaps even more important to educate civilian providers who may be unfamiliar with the unique physical, mental and emotional needs related to military service.\n\nCourse Audience\n - all health professions learners, example:\n - medical students, resident physicians, dental students,\n - nursing students, advanced practice nurses,\n - social work, pharmacy student as graduate level learners\n - as well as any and all health professionals interested in veteran-centered care\n\nWhat You Will Learn:\nThis course will provide learners the opportunity to engage with material to facilitate their understanding of the origins of Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Administration affiliations, recognize and manage the influence of bias, class, and power on the clinical encounter and self-reflect on their biases that particularly affect U.S. military veterans.   This course also features several video clips from the acclaimed documentary, Where Soldiers Come From, directed by Heather Courtney.\n\n\nThe views expressed in this course are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the U.S. government.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1Unit 1 highlights the relationship between Academic Medical Centers and Veterans Health Administration and provides an overview of knowledge of the military and basic demographic of U.S. veterans.Unit 2Unit 2 provides clear instruction on conceptual differences between determinants of health and health disparities and health care disparities; illustrate individual-based and system-based sources of health disparities for veterans.Unit 3Unit 3 outlines the fundamental principles of patient-centeredness and cultural competence in health care, provide tools to develop self-awareness of individual assumptions, stereotypes and biases that influence the medical encounter and deliver activities that help learners acknowledge the importance of patients’ values, culture, and beliefs in improving health care.Unit 4Unit 4 illustrates the role of empathy in health care delivery, using key experiences, concerns and perspectives of U.S. military veterans as a clinical context. This unit also describes the relationship between medical history taking and health care delivery as well as develops knowledge in areas related to military and veteran centered care.\nUnit 5Unit 5 allows learners to use everything they have learned and apply those principles to improving assessment and triage skills for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and identifying anxiety and depression.Unit 6Unit 6 highlights the importance of partnership and collaboration across professional disciplines to enhance veteran centered to achieve optimal health.\nUnit 7Unit 7 highlights the importance of partnership and collaboration across professional disciplines to enhance veteran centered care.\n                                    ",

By learning the methods of QI and implementing these methods, you will add powerful QI tools to your ‘toolbox.’ You will learn the steps in the QI process during short lectures and reflective exercises, Then you will identify a clinically relevant project  to address in your own practice setting or a personal improvement project and apply the QI tools.The QI project will be considered within the context of interprofessional teams and from a systems perspective. Care environments are complex settings and call for a sophisticated set of collaborative teamwork skills and systems thinking. The objective of this course is to empower you, the working healthcare professional, to improve your knowledge and skills in the science of quality improvement so that you can take action in your own clinical setting to improve the quality of care for your patients and their families.\nThis course has been approved for 27.7 contact hours and for module by module contact hours. See module agenda for number of contact hours available for specific modules. These contact hours will be awarded to participants who complete individual modules and the evaluation components. Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing (OH-216/11-01-15) is an approved provider of continuing nursing education by the Ohio Nurses Association (OBN-001-91), an accredited approver by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The 5-week course provides healthcare professionals across the world with the basic knowledge and skills to improve the quality and safety of health care using process improvement methods.  Quality and safety in healthcare is an international priority.  In the United States, it is a driver for change that is mandated by regulation, accreditation and reimbursement. Therefore it is essential to educate all healthcare professionals, faculty and students about contemporary approaches to improve quality and safety, supporting the goal to move quality improvement out of the ‘quality department’ and into the ‘hands of the professionals who deliver care.This is an interprofessional course. The audience for the course includes front-line healthcare professionals, faculty and students in health professions schools, and other interested individuals. It is most relevant for nurses, physicians, pharmacists, social workers, therapists, dietitians, and healthcare administrators. An interdisciplinary framework is used that includes both theory and experiential components. The emphasis is on acquiring competence in quality improvement methods and teamwork and collaboration. The course will transform healthcare professionals to not only ‘do their work, but also to ‘improve their work.Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to apply methods of continuous quality improvement to:Define quality and safety problems in the healthcare system;Assess organizational contextual factors and benchmarks of best practices in quality and safety;andDesign, implement, and evaluate tests of change to improve healthcare systems.Learners will integrate the principles of interprofessional teamwork as an essential feature of the improvement process.For each of five weeks there are two 1-hour didactic modules with active learning that include:Videos of core learning content (see syllabus outline);Lessons learned from the field that include stories from healthcare professionals;Active interaction using assignments and case studies; Reflective exercises on the discussion board to apply the learning to the participants’ work settings; and Required readings in advance of each module.Evaluation consists of achievement of learner competencies that are assessed with:Pre and post course evaluation for QI knowledge, attitudes, systems thinking and pre and post module evaluation of self-efficacy;Quiz after each module; andLearner evaluation of the course.Continuous Quality Improvement in ActionThrough case study analysis and individual clinically based projects, participants will experience and reflect on the dimensions of improvement:Explain the system of care; Identify factors related to psychology of change;Differentiate the types of variation (common and special) present in a process; andDescribe one Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle.Interdisciplinary Team WorkThrough work within teams within the clinical setting, participants will:Describe why and how disciplines, each representing a body of scientific knowledge, must work together to achieve continual improvement of health care;Demonstrate an appreciation for various health disciplines and a realization that improvement will occur by cooperative problem solving;Analyze the contributions of each discipline to the group project; Identify ways to improve collaborative efforts; andDemonstrate the ability to give and receive constructive feedback.The course is divided into modules addressing:Week #       Module #                                                     Content1                         1              Overview of Healthcare Quality Improvement                           2              Evidence for Improvement, Literature, Internet and More2                         3              Interprofessional Teams for Improvement Work                           4              Knowledge of Systems3                         5              Targeting Your Aim from Global to Specific                           6              Measuring for Improvement4                         7              Data Variation and Control Charts                           8              The Human Side of QI: Psychology of Change5                         9              Pilot, Implement &amp; Spread Change: The Model for                                                          Improvement                           10             Putting it All Together: Facilitating &amp; Leading Change\n                                    ",

All buzzwords of recent years that excite, confuse and infuriate the public, researchers and healthcare professionals. Broadly speaking, these terms all refer to the idea of tailoring treatment to individual patients based on their genetic code.\n\nWhat does it all mean, and why should you care?\n\nThis free online course will discuss both the hype and hope surrounding the genetic revolution and personalised medicine. The impact of personalised medicine on clinical practice will likely yield significant benefits for patients, yet it raises a number of serious ethical and legal issues for health professionals, patients and the community.\n\nExplore the power of genetics across disease prevention and diagnosis\n\nIn this unique course you will learn from leading researchers and healthcare professionals how genetic testing is currently used to guide treatment across diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and mental health, and infectious disease. You will also explore the power of genetics to impact disease prevention and diagnosis, and the social, legal, political and ethical implications of this new knowledge.\n\nExamine key personalised medicine topics week by week\n\nWeek One: We begin by discussing what causes disease and development of personal traits – our genes or our environment? We will also explore how genes are passed from one generation to the next, basic medical genetics, and how recent technological and scientific advances have heralded the advent of the genetic revolution, and the global approach and impact of these advances.\n\nWeek Two: We will explore the concept of risk and multifactorial disease. We will describe examples of genes that pre-dispose patients to specific diseases, and discuss genetic testing and genetic counselling.\n\nWeek Three: We will investigate the use of personalised medicine today and tease out the reality from the hype. We will also explore the apparent delay between research findings and translation to the clinic - from bench to bedside.\n\nWeek Four: We will describe the rationale of medical patents, clinical trials, drug approval and regulation, and how these differ in various parts of the world.\n\nWeek Five: We will explore and debate the legal and ethical issues surrounding genetic testing and personalised medicine.\n\nForm your own opinion on the genetic revolution\n\nThis course will distill the hype around personalised medicine, and allow you to form your own opinion on the advantages and disadvantages of the genetic revolution. Learning from a wide variety of expert clinicians and researchers currently working in the field, you will be equipped with the language and skills to debate the impact of personalised medicine on your own situation.\n\n\n                                    ",

It is now possible to analyse all 20,000 human genes in a single experiment, rather than focussing on one gene at a time. We are in the genomics era.\n\nThis free online course will introduce the topic of genomics, using the University of Exeter’s research expertise in diabetes, to illustrate the clinical application of current genomics knowledge.\n\nExplore the impact of genomic testing\n\nWe will use patient experiences to discuss the impact and value of a genetic diagnosis for diabetes for patients, their families and the clinicians responsible for their care. You will learn about the value of understanding the underlying pathological mechanism of a disease, to enable the progression from genomic testing to improvements in clinical care.\n\nFind out how genomics can inform us about disease risks\n\nYou will learn about: the different modes of inheritance for diabetes, including polygenic, monogenic, mitochondrial and epigenetic; the molecular basis of these inheritance patterns; and how this relates to risk for individuals, families and populations.\n\nUnderstand the strategies for genomic testing\n\nYou will be taken through the process of discovering novel genetic mutations in the genome, including intergenic regions, previously thought to play a minor role in gene function. This will include thinking about the pattern of inheritance, to design a strategy for gene discovery, through to the latest laboratory techniques used for genomic sequencing.\n\nThere will also be an introduction to the bioinformatics resources and techniques used to interpret the wealth of genomic data generated by the techniques described.\n\nWe won’t be able to join the discussions ourselves, so we hope that the course will be one that develops a strong learning community. We encourage you to participate fully in discussions, to support other learners and to share knowledge where possible, and hope that you will enjoy interacting with and learning from each other in this way.\n\n\n                                    ",

For the first time, once deadly infectious diseases, such as pneumonia and bloodstream infections, became manageable health problems and new horizons for modern medicine were defined. The marketing of other antibiotics soon followed, and as a result of their initial success, bacterial infections were considered to be permanently defeated.\r\nExplore the rise of antibiotic resistance\r\nHowever, misuse of antibiotics worldwide has eroded their efficacy and antibiotic-resistant bacteria rapidly emerge and spread across the globe. At the same time, the pipeline of new antibiotics is now almost dry.\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reports that we have arrived at a point where the pandemic of antibiotic resistance has become a global health crisis. It is a silent tsunami that, without a sound, roars over the world and crumbles down the pillars upon which modern medicine is built. More than anything, this situation requires immediate action and we all need to share the responsibility for preserving antibiotics for current and future generations.\r\nUnderstand antibiotic resistance and how to take action\r\nThis free online course introduces the concepts of antibiotic resistance and what actions are needed to meet this global health threat.\r\nOver the four weeks, you will learn about the mechanisms behind the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, gain insight into the current situation, and take part of real-life stories told by patients, doctors, and other experts.\r\nThis knowledge will help you to understand what challenges we are facing, but also what preventative actions and other control mechanisms we can implement to limit the impact of antibiotic resistance on our society.\r\nExamine the development and use of antibiotics worldwide\r\nAs we progress through the weeks, we will also discuss the modest development of new antibiotics, as well as the urgent need for innovation in the field.

As need for humanitarian aid grows, how can efforts to alleviate human suffering evolve with it?\n\nThis course from the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and HarvardX seeks to prepare learners to recognize and analyze emerging challenges in the humanitarian field. The course explores the ethical and professional principles that guide humanitarian response to conflict and disaster. Participants will learn the legal and historical frameworks that shaped these principles, test their applicability to the challenges faced by humanitarian actors today.\n\nThrough four case studies covering the responses to crises in Goma (Zaire), Somalia, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Pakistan, participants will engage with Harvard faculty, current practitioners, and one another. These cases introduce major trends affecting the current landscape of humanitarian response – including rapid population displacement, violence against aid workers, and civil-military engagement. Thoughtfully engaging with this course will prepare participants to be informed and aware humanitarian practitioners, scholars, policy-makers, and global citizens.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

Ever wondered what all those letters and numbers a dentist calls out during your check-up mean? How are broken teeth fixed, or how dentures are made? Join Dr Christopher Stokes from the School of Clinical Dentistry at The University of Sheffield on a learning journey to explore the dental profession and the impact dentistry has on all our lives.\n\nThroughout this course you’ll hear from, and interact with, experts from all corners of the dental professions to discover dentistry.\n\nStarting with the public perception of dentistry, to the sometimes gruesome history of the profession, we will explore the context of dentistry today. Through interactive exercises we will demystify the various roles and activities within a dental practice, and explore in detail how common dental diseases and problems are treated by talking to the experts and watching them work. We will investigate how false teeth and dental crowns are made, and take a glimpse into the future by looking at the latest technology of 3D printed teeth.\n\nThis course is for everyone. Whether you are an aspiring dentist, preparing for a dental school interview, or want to learn about the interesting multidisciplinary world of looking after smiles, join us for an entertaining and insightful exploration of your mouth and the people who care for it.\n\n\n                                    ",

A group of expert faculty will explore a scientific approach to improvement — a practical, rigorous methodology that includes a theory of change, measurable aims, and iterative, incremental small tests of change to determine if improvement concepts can be implemented effectively in practice. Faculty will present this science through the lens of improving health and health care, but will also share examples of how improvement can (and does) influence our daily lives.\n\nEach week, learners will dive into engaging, interactive materials and relevant resources to start building an improvement toolkit that will serve them long after the six-week course ends. Learners will immediately put their new skills to the test as they work each week on a personal improvement project that will show them the power of the science that has improved healthcare — and other industries — around the world for decades.\n\nThe only prerequisite for the course is curiosity, but the reward is a lifetime of improvement.\n\n \n\n\n\nThis collaboration between the Institute of Healthcare Improvement and HarvardX will teach you the skills and tools of improvement science to make positive changes in health, healthcare, and your daily life.\n\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

The Metabolic Applied Research Strategy (MARS) represents a comprehensive approach to developing an understanding of the mechanisms that drive the significant improvements in health associated with metabolic and bariatric surgery. The groundbreaking insights generated through MARS research are redefining the management of obesity, associated metabolic conditions, and patient care. This free online course is your opportunity to learn about those insights. But more than that, it's an opportunity for you to reshape the conversation when it comes to the obesity epidemic and the role of bariatric surgery.\r\nJoin us as we explore the truth of the \"energy balance equation,\" establish the notion of a \"set point,\" and subsequently debunk a controversial set of myths associated with obesity and bariatric surgery. (Spoiler alert: Obesity is far more complex than most people believe, and bariatric surgery is much more about physiological changes than it is about mechanical changes.) The two lead MARS investigators will share their findings and attempt to contextualize them for you, but this course will also be powered by the interactions you will have with your fellow learners. We will provide plenty of opportunity for you to discuss, debate, and ultimately, to learn from one another. At the end of our 6 weeks together, you'll be thinking and talking about obesity and the role of bariatric surgery in new and unexpected ways.\n\n                                    ",

Estimates suggest that over 98,000 patients die in US hospitals each year due to medical errors; making medical errors a leading cause of death. Adverse events in healthcare often result from problems in the complex systems of care. Improving patient safety demands a complex system-wide effort, involving a wide range of actions in performance improvement, environmental safety and risk management.

What's actually in a vaccine? Are vaccines effective? Are they safe?  Should a society require that all citizens get certain vaccines?In this course, Dr. Paul Offit will tackle these questions and more. We will explore the history, science, and debate behind vaccines.  We'll trace the development of vaccines over the past two and a half centuries, and describe methods for the attenuation of various viruses and bacteria. We'll discuss the benefits of vaccines in the United States and around the world, and we'll also explore the risks, both real and perceived, associated with vaccines. We'll look at how the media shapes the conversation about vaccines and some controversies that surround them, specifically that vaccines cause autism, multiple sclerosis, neurodevelopmental delays, diabetes or other chronic problems. The focus throughout the course will be on research and real-world examples and the discussion will conclude with an update on newly created vaccines and recent outbreaks of previously controlled diseases.Dr. Offit is an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology and a Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.For additional information about vaccines, the Vaccine Education Center, or its program for parents, called Parents PACK, please visit:http://vaccine.chop.eduhttp://vaccine.chop.edu/parentshttp://www.prevent-hpv.com\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK ONE: History of Vaccines An overview of the history of vaccines is covered in week one starting with the first vaccine, the vaccine for smallpox, and concluding with discussion of Recombinant DNA and Reassortant Viruses.WEEK TWO: Schedules and Common Questions Current and alternate vaccine schedules are discussed as well as possible benefits and drawbacks of choosing an alternative schedule. The subject of vaccines raises many questions in various levels. \"What are vaccines? Are they safe? Do they cause chronic illness?\" These and other questions are also addressed in week two.WEEK THREE: Vaccines and the MediaSuch topics as the media's role in medical education of the population, the power of popular anecdote over fact, and the purported link between MMR and Autism will be discussed all in relation to the role of vaccines in society. WEEK FOUR: Case Study - The Rotavirus Vaccine The rotavirus structure is discussed along with functional properties of rotavirus proteins. The risks and benefits of Rotasheild in the U.S. and in the developing world, and processes and results of Rotateq trials are also examined.WEEK FIVE: Exemptions Various aspects and causes of vaccine exemptions are explored, including safety issues, tragedies, religious exemptions, and specific lawsuits. The consequences of exemptions, including breakdowns in herd immunity, are also discussed.WEEK SIX: Recent Vaccines and Outbreaks The course concludes with an overview of newly created vaccines and recent outbreaks of previously controlled diseases.\n                                    ",

One important component of Precision Medicine is the use of an individual’s genomic information to offer targeted treatment, tailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide participants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical applications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity and utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and social issues inherent in this field.  \n\nThe course is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be accessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic understanding of genetics.  It is designed to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and practical information about real-world applications of genomics. Lessons 1 and 4 offer a basic primer on molecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient populations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics and present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: New insights into the structure of the human genome and different types of genetic and non-genetic variation that occur\nWeek 2: Genetic screening and diagnosis: prenatal carrier testing and newborn screening for Mendelian diseases \nWeek 3: The use of next-generation sequencing for solving diagnostic dilemmas\nWeek 4: Methods used in patient populations to uncover associations between genome variation and common diseases \nWeek 5: Predictive tests for common, complex diseases\nWeek 6: Pharmacogenomic testing for drug selection, dosing and predicting adverse effects of commonly prescribed drugs\nWeek 7: Tumor profiling for targeting cancer treatment and the use of blood-based gene expression profiles in cancer prognosis\n                                    ",

The question is, how can health organisations provide high quality and safe healthcare to growing populations, with increasingly complex needs, while remaining within budget constraints? And how can health leaders respond effectively to consumer and community concerns and demands, while at the same time managing a highly skilled workforce, all within organisational, regulatory and political constraints?  This course will look at these questions from the perspective of healthcare leaders. We will consider what the latest research, practitioners, and opinion leaders tell us about how to ensure a safe, efficient and equitable healthcare service. We will also explore what it means to take on a leadership role in the context of current healthcare challenges, including that of ensuring the quality, safety and equity of care. Throughout the course, we will be discussing the knowledge, skills and capabilities individuals require to lead effectively, and will outline approaches leaders can take to leading health teams and organisations.  By the end of this course, you should be able to:1.

So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.\n\nThis two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals, researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.\n\nDelivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines and effect behaviour change. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.\n\nBy the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:\n\n1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines\n\n2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.\n\nThe learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.\n\nSuccess and feedback from the course\n\nSince April 2014 over 10,000 learners registered on this course from across the world. There has been a rich multidisciplinary range of healthcare professionals, including primary and secondary care pharmacists, doctors, nurses and dentists, alongside patients and carers. Following the course, learners indicated that they agreed or strongly agreed that:\n\n\n  \n    they had gained skills and knowledge from the course that will allow them to work more effectively with patients with medicines adherence issues (94%).\n  \n  \n    the course would enable them to respond to medicines adherence issues with greater confidence (93%).\n  \n  \n    the course had added a fresh perspective to their current role (95%).\n  \n  \n    they would recommend the course to a colleague or friend (97%).\n  \n\n\n\n                                    ",

Together, we will look in detail at why we do research and how we do it. We will bring this to life through cases studies covering topics such as how research is helping to find new ways of treating and providing care for some of the major diseases including cancer and dementia. Through the course we will focus on the important ethical questions raised by clinical research and take a look into the future.\n\nOver four weeks, we will speak to different members of a research team, including academics and clinicians from the National Institute of Health Research and the University of Leeds. We will also hear from the ordinary people who have participated in clinical research studies.\n\nWe’ll learn how they all make invaluable contributions to the process of discovery. By the end, you will have a much better understanding of not only the challenges of conducting clinical research, but also the enormous benefits that it can offer to modern healthcare.\n\nWhat do previous learners say?\n\nIn this video you can hear from people who participated in the course the last time it was run. Here are a few comments from past learners:\n\n\n  “It made me look at research in a different light…it gave me confidence”\n  “Anything that helps us to improve patient care, has got to be a good thing”\n  “Helps you understand that people don’t do research to you….they can not do research without you”\n  “Everyone has different questions and views on research, this brings it all together”\n\n\nAccreditation\n\nThis course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles. By completing the course you will have achieved 16 hours of CPD time.\n\n\n                                    ",

It is an umbrella term that captures concepts about the health context, technology, and people.\n\nIn this free online course, we will provide you with insight into the domain of eHealth, describe methods to develop eHealth, and explain theories that enable behaviour change and facilitate implementation. You will also understand how eHealth technologies are developed and used in practice, by means of a variety of case studies, assignments and examples.\n\nThis course pays attention to the perspectives of the eHealth developers, patients, healthcare professionals and healthy people who want to improve or maintain their health and wellbeing. These perspectives are applied to the three main topics of this course:\n\nDuring Weeks 1 and 2, we will introduce eHealth and show you how eHealth technologies are used to enable or improve self-care and prevention, supportive care, and societal health.\nWeeks 3 and 4 will focus on design. You will learn how to design eHealth that fits the user and the context, and is able to seduce or support people into changing their behaviour.\nIn Weeks 5 and 6, we focus on the diffusion and evaluation of eHealth technologies within the intended context, and among users and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nAfter finishing this course, you will have new knowledge about eHealth, acquired relevant eHealth skills, and gained insight into the use of eHealth in practice.\n\n\n                                    ",

Diferentes trabajos de investigación han demostrado la importancia que tiene la postura, especialmente de la columna vertebral, en la aparición, desarrollo y prevención de patologías raquídeas. La adopción de posturas inadecuadas en las actividades cotidianas (limpiar, sentarse, llevar una mochila, coger pesos, etc.) y en la práctica físico-deportiva, aumenta el riesgo de alteración en las diferentes estructuras que componen la columna vertebral. Además, en el caso de tener alguna desalineación postural (hipercifosis, hiperlordosis, escoliosis, etc.) es preciso adoptar medidas posturales oportunas. En ámbito educativo se plantean contenidos de postura corporal, que se deben desarrollar mediante situaciones lúdicas que permitan al alumnado conocer su sistema músculo-esquelético, identificar las posturas corporales más correctas, así como elegir los ejercicios más adecuados.\n\n                                    ",

What used to be an experimental, risky, and very limited treatment option more than 50 years ago is now routinely performed in many countries worldwide. The number of renal transplants is expected to rise sharply in the next decade since the proportion of patients with end stage renal disease is increasing. \n\nAre you interested in clinical kidney, pancreas and islet transplantation? If you are a (bio) medical student or a health care professional who works in the (pre) clinical transplant field this might be the course for you. This course is also for anyone interested in the research and knowledge on clinical transplantation. The course will be taught by a multidisciplinary team of transplant professionals and will give you the state of the art updates. \n\nIt is divided in 4 modules: \n1) Before the transplant \n2) The surgical procedures and the challenged patient, including the patient with diabetes \n3) Early challenges \n4) Late challenges after transplantation. \n\nThe offered modules will include lectures, interactive patient cases, 3D movies, interviews with well-known experts and with patients and a donor, a serious game to increase knowledge of the field and of course an active forum. Become an expert and join us!\n\nThe course is endorsed by The European Society of Organ Transplantation (ESOT), The International Society of Nephrology (ISN) and The Transplantation Society (TTS).\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Before the TransplantWelcome to this first module of Clinical Kidney Transplantation! This week we will answer important questions before transplantation. These include: why is transplantation the preferred option for patients with end stage renal disease? what are the immunological barriers for transplantation? and what are the selection criteria before transplantation? Unique 3d movies about the different immunological tests will help you to understand the concepts. There are also advanced optional lectures, including a fascinating movie about the Eurotransplant allocation system. At the end of the module we will link the contents you have learned to clinical patient cases, patient - donor interviews and a quiz. You can find each other on the discussion forum. With the etivities you can apply your knowledge. Have fun and good luck with the first module!The Procedure and the Patient Now you know the factors of importance before transplantation, including the immunological  barriers and important aspects for patient selection,  we can focus on challenged patient  groups and on surgical procedures. \nWhat does a kidney, pancreas and islet transplantation surgical procedure look like? What  is important? And what are the key aspects in elderly patients, patients with diabetes and immunological challenged patients. We have unique visulisations and a game about a patient case. Advanced readings will invite you to look at the different subjects in more depth. At the end of the module there are interviews about a patient with diabetes and the transplant recipient and donor to illustrate the impact of life. You can discuss patient cases on the forum together with your peers. Let’s start and we hope you enjoy this module.\nEarly Challenges in TransplantationYou are now familiar with the basic knowledge about challenges in transplant recipients and the surgical transplant procedures. Once the transplantation has been successful, it doesn’t mean everything is stable. What are actually the graft survival data? Which challenges do we face in the first months? How can we tackle these challenges? 3D movies about early surgical challenges and about the targets for immunosuppressives, including cell therapy, will help you to understand the concepts. In addition, we invite you to master the advanced knowledge and to give your opinion in the patient cases in the forum. There is also a serious game about a patient case. Can you solve the challenges? And can you think of a scenario for the game and help us building? We will make a game of the best scenario, which will be incorporated in the course. Good luck with this module and happy learning!\nLate Challenges in TransplantationNow you’ve learned about the challenges in the early period after transplantation. But what about the late period? What is the long term patient and allograft survival? Have we improved in the last decades. What are the main causes for morbidity and mortality? And can we reach tolerance in the future? We invite you to give your opinion in the \npatient cases and to discuss it on the forum. There are also advanced readings to look at additional subjects, including recurrence of the kidney disease after transplantation, the organization of dermatological care for the transplant recipiënt and  the role of the patient himself in the whole process. The interview about tolerance gives you insight why pregnancy is of interest to understand the concept of tolerance and which steps have been made from lab research to a clinical protocol. Have fun and good luck with this last module.Final Quiz We hope you have enjoyed all the modules. Good luck with the final quiz!\n                                    ",

This course will present short primers in genetics and mechanisms underlying variability in drug responses. A series of case studies will be used to illustrate principles of how genetics are being brought to bear on refining diagnoses and on personalizing treatment in rare and common diseases. The ethical and operational issues around how to implement large scale genomic sequencing in clinical practice will be addressed. \n\nAfter completing this course, learners will understand\n1. The ways in which genetic variants can contribute to human disease susceptibility\n2. How to choose among drug therapies based on genetic factors  \n3. That the functional consequences of the vast majority of genetic variants discovered by modern sequencing are unknown.\n\nThis course is targeted primarily at physicians 5+ years out of training. Other healthcare providers, medical/health sciences students, and members of the public may also be interested. \n\nCourse launches January 15, 2016.\n\n* The information presented in “Case Studies in Personalized Medicine” is offered for educational and informational purposes only, and should not be construed as personal medical advice.

We will very briefly review fundamentals of genetics as these apply to personalized medicine (DNA structure; RNA; protein structures; function of DNA; coding; DNA variations; types of genetic variants), as well as review statistical concepts and skills important to clinical data analysis (odds ratios, relative risk, P values, multiple testing, sensitivity, specificity, ROCs). In Module 2 we will explore drug actions and reactions as we look closely at the general mechanisms underlying variability in drug responses, drug metabolism and transport, and genetic variability in drug-handling molecules.UNIT 2: STUDYING GENETIC VARIATIONModule 3 focuses on how we study genetic variation. We'll start by looking at families and populations. Topics that will be introduced include family history and inheritance patterns, ancestry, and linkage. Then in Module 4 we shift our focus to studying the contemporary techniques and technologies used to study genetic variation, including genome-wide association and sequencing.UNIT 3: CASE STUDIES IN PERSONALIZED MEDICINE, PART 1In Module 5 we will begin to discuss specific cases as these apply to personalized medicine. We will first look very closely at a case of familial hypercholesterolemia as we investigate how we use genomic medicine to move from a rare disease to a common medication, using genomics to find new drug targets, and a discussion of the side effects of statin therapy. In Module 6 we will look at a collection of \"high risk pharmacogenetics\"cases that illustrate adverse reactions due to drug metabolism and variable drug responses.UNIT 4: CASE STUDIES IN PERSONALIZED MEDICINE, PART 2Module 7 continues our focus on case studies with a look at some cases that illustrate how personalized medicine informs treatment decisions related to specific diseases/conditions. These include cystic fibrosis, Marfan syndrome, heart failure, neuropsychiatric diseases, and diabetes. Three cases/lessons focus specifically on how genomic medicine informs testing for and treatment of cancer.  UNIT 5: PERSONALIZED MEDICINE IN A SYSTEM OF CAREModule 8 serves as a review and a continuing discussion of the cases presented in Modules 5-7, as we take a look at where we are now and what's on the horizon in personalized medicine. In Module 9 we will explore some critical considerations for implementing and operationalizing personalized medicine in a system of care, particularly in the area of informatics. We will discuss the role of the electronic medical record in a learning healthcare system, how electronic records support discovery, and using electronic records in the delivery of personalized medicine.     FINAL REFLECTION ACTIVITYWe are on the verge of having patients come to their physicians with their entire genome sequenced. How can we best use this information to improve care? This course looks closely at many specific genetic variants that have been identified as playing a role in a person’s susceptibility to disease and/or potential for adverse reaction to certain substances/drugs. \n\nIn the peer review activity below, please reflect on how your learning in this course has impacted your understanding of personalized medicine. There are two versions of this activity – one for healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, medical students, etc.), and one for non-healthcare professionals (patients, consumers, general interest, etc.) \n\nPlease be sure to choose the appropriate version of the activity.\n\n                                    ",

We consider economic, social, political and human rights factors, and the challenges women face in maintaining health and managing their lives in the face of societal pressures and obstacles.\r\nWe focus on critical issues, namely those that may mean life or death to a woman, depending on whether she can exercise her human rights. These critical issues include: being born female and discrimination; poverty; unequal access to education, food, paid work and health care; and various forms of violence. Topics discussed include son preference, education, HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, violence in the home and in war and refugee circumstances, women's work, sex trafficking, and aging.\r\nOur MOOC will have a special focus on creating an international network of engaged students. We will ask students to take part in interactive discussions and cooperative exercises and to share their own experiences. We also ask students to engage with the communities they live in, in order to deepen their understanding of the issues and tie academic ideas to real-life circumstances.\r\nTo find out more details about this course and its principles, please visit our Project Page atwww.internationalwomenshealth.org\n\n                                    ",

Anatomically it includes diseases in the upper urinary tract like the kidneys and ureters, the lower urinary tract like the urinary bladder and urethra, and the male inner and outer genitals like the prostate, testicles and the epididymis.\n \nMany of the symptoms from these organs belong to the top 100 most common symptoms for which patients seek help. This course will set you on a path to a basic understanding of the most common symptoms from the genitourinary system.\n\nYou might think that urology merely is a surgical specialty but that opinion couldn’t be more wrong.

It will\nrequire your active participation in creating health literate interactions at\nvarious organizational levels. This course will provide the opportunity to\nreinforce existing opportunities to work together as a multidisciplinary team\nor fill a gap if you haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet! \n\nUpon completion\nof the course, you will be able to:\n\n1.     Define health literacy and how it applies to all health disciplines. 2.     List the varied factors that influence health literacy and health communication. 3.     Identify who is affected by health literacy and health communication. 4.     Recognize the consequences of limited health literacy and poor health communication. 5.     Determine the stakeholders in health literacy and health communication. 6.     Recognize the role of health literacy in meeting core health service across disciplines. 7.      Apply strategies to improve health literacy at the group, organizational, community, and policy levels\n\nIn addition to these\ncourse objectives, it is key to the success of the student that participants\nunderstand their responsibilities of working as a part of an inter-professional\nhealth care team. The basis of patient-centered care and the foundation of the\nmedical home model is that health professionals will learn and implement skills\nto meet the community’s health needs in the context of the community’s daily\nlives—which is their reality! That includes recognizing the social determinants\nof health, such as complex social, economic, environmental, and political\nfactors, that impact both the public’s wellness and their health literacy, too.\n\n\nOne initial\nstep – a recommended prerequisite to beginning this online course – is to first\ncomplete the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s self-directed online\ntraining, “Health Literacy for Public Health Professionals”. It\nprovides a good foundation about health literacy in three brief, interactive\nlessons which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete. \n\nWe are also\nusing the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy discussion\npaper, “Ten Attributes of Health Literate Health Care Organizations” as a guide.  This online course will assist its participants in understanding that health\nliteracy needs to be an organizational value and embraced as part of the\norganization’s core business.  \n\nA phrase that we often like to use is “help a person connect the dots”. By this we mean we\nneed to make sure that understanding of health information exists. An example\nof this would be thinking if someone is advised they need to take a\nmedication, or told they need to change daily choices and behaviors\nto improve health that it will simply happen as directed. But, there are\nmany necessary steps, strategies, and skills in communication for the advice being given to actually happen.  Often, current health\nprofessionals and health care settings often assume that “one size fits all”\nwhen it comes to communicating health messages.  This course will focus on\nsome approaches to becoming a health literate health care organization by using\nscenarios with actors based on patient experiences, by also letting patients\nshare their experiences in their own words, and by offering suggestions\nfor improvement in health communication.\n\nWe hope you join us and become an agent of change both in your own discipline and as a\nmember of an inter-professional team in health care organizations going\nforward!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The course\nconsists of the following eight modules:\n\n\n Literacy: Its role in\n     health care organizations\n Initiation: Preparing the\n     health care workforce\n They: Who are we serving?\n Equipped: Using the best\n     tools for communication\n Results: Evaluating our\n     efforts\n Access: Providing plain\n     information\n Transferring Information:\n     Using the best channels \n Essential Skills:\n     Communicating high risk and care transitions\n\n\nEach module in\nthis course will focus on one or two attributes to guide you in exploring an action in your discipline as well as how being a member of an\ninter-professional team has advantages for improving organizational responses\nto health literacy.\n                                    ",

Despite striking advances in information technology, clinical problem solving has not yet been effectively replicated by computers, making it essential that clinicians work to develop expertise in this very important skill set.  While television shows make this seem like a magical process, work done by cognitive psychologists and medical educators has helped us understand the ways in which expert physicians reason through these difficult problems to help their patients.\n \nThis course will examine the ways physicians think about clinical problem solving and will help participants develop competence in the building blocks of clinical problem solving. The professor will use cases to illustrate different reasoning strategies and will discuss how both correct and incorrect diagnoses result from these strategies. Participants will use sample clinical cases to practice what they have learned through the lectures. Finally, the professor will discuss strategies to help students and young physicians read textbooks and articles in a way that enhances their ability to use information in the clinical environment. \n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: How experts understand diseases and how to read like an expert to form disease based illness scripts.Module 2: How experts analyze their patient' problems: processing and the patient illness script.Module 3: Using disease and patient illness scripts to prioritize differential diagnostic possibilities into tiers of probabilityModule 4: Understanding how diagnostic tests can be appropriately used to improve diagnostic accuracy.Module 5: Diagnostic Mistakes: how they happen, how you can avoid them and how to find them once they occur.Module 6: How our clinical problem solving strategies can be used to write good test questions, perform well on tests, and teach others to do well too.\n                                    ",

In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute\n    of the History of Pharmacy has written that, “...the very concept\n    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered\n    one of humanity’s greatest advances.” Since its independent origins\n    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated\n    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients\n    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.\nSo what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?\nThis course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction\n    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving\n    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues\n    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into\n    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.\nAs we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists\n    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what\n    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.\n    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career\n    path that you want to pursue!  Whether student or healthcare consumer,\n    you’re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.All lectures and instructional materials developed for this course by the Ohio State University are licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

In a round the world regatta such as the Barcelona World Race, which lasts for three months, the sailors race for weeks on end in some of the planet's most inhospitable and remote waters. That's why it's important for them to have a high level of hygiene and medical knowledge to help them to survive and overcome any illnesses, injuries or physiological disturbances they may experience out on the ocean. With that in mind, the sailors have a remote medical care service available to them, set up by the regatta organisers and based on the latest telecommunications technologies.\r\nDuring this course, you will learn about the basic medical techniques for the prevention of medical problems on board a yacht, how to plan medical prevention and active techniques to deal with some of the main issues that may arise during a two-crew round the world regatta. You will also be introduced to telemedical assistance protocols and the technology associated with it.\r\nThis course is aimed at the general public and anyone with an interest in sailing or medicine. It is also aimed at those involved in the world of sailing who are interested in dealing with health issues in a straightforward and quick manner, either on board a boat or in a maritime context. It's also aimed at healthcare professionals who want to expand their knowledge of sailing and want to prepare a first aid kit with the basic materials to deal with small problems on board.\r\nThe content may also be relevant and provide knowledge for trainee doctors and nurses or for those volunteering for sea or coastal rescue organisations (Red Cross, Sea Rescue or Lifeguards).\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The course is structured around five modules.\r\nModule 1A general approach to onboard health\r\nModule 2Evaluating an emergency (PAR)\r\nModule 3Symptom evaluation\r\nModule 4Non-traumatic problems\r\nModule 5Traumatic problems \n                                    ",

At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence – inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This course will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage the learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology.Learning ObjectivesDevelop skills to apply IDSA guidelines in treating common infections such as acute rhino-sinusitis.Apply evidence based antibiotic management to treat sepsis.Implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship when providing care to special populations and in various settings.Apply evidence based antibiotic management to surgical patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis.Apply evidence based antibiotic stewardship program in the outpatient setting.Accreditation StatementThe Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.AMA Credit Designation StatementThe Stanford University School of Medicine designates this enduring material for a maximum of 6.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)™. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.DisclosuresThe following Course Director has indicated that he has a relationship with industry to disclose relative to the content of this activity during the planning phase.

You will be given a unique insight into modern genetics laboratories and state of the art sequencing facilities, led by clinical scientists who are using whole genome sequencing to shape decisions about patient care and appropriate treatments.\n\nYou will be introduced to the fundamental basics of DNA and genetic variation, before exploring the process of whole genome sequencing and the ways in which the resultant data can be analysed and used to benefit patients. Leading scientists and genomics experts will explore the potential and limitations of this new technology, and the ethical questions that arise when we can ‘read a person’s genome’.\n\nExplore how whole genome sequencing affects healthcare\n\nThroughout the course you will be introduced to a range of case studies and scenarios where whole genome sequencing is having a profound impact on healthcare and life decisions. You will be introduced to England’s pioneering 100,000 Genomes Project and its potential impact on how we understand and care for patients with rare diseases and cancer. You will also discover how genomics is being used in epidemiology and helping us tackle infectious diseases.\n\n\n                                    ",

Mientras esas técnicas y posibilidades terapéuticas avanzan, persisten sin embargo muchos interrogantes sobre el modo en el que los órganos pueden obtenerse lícitamente. Algunos de esos dilemas nos acompañan desde siempre, otros son suscitados por la aparición de fenómenos novedosos como el turismo de trasplantes, las posibilidades que ofrece la donación tras la muerte cardiocirculatoria o los descubrimientos sobre las funciones fisiológicas remanentes en los pacientes diagnosticados en muerte cerebral. En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?\nEn este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos\n The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. \n\n                                    ",

We’ll discover how HTA uses sophisticated research methods and techniques, to bring this evidence together in a format that can be used in a variety of health systems around the world.\n\nWe’ll look at some of the key processes of HTA in order to answer some key questions about a new treatment, such as:\n\n\n  How do we know if the treatment is of benefit?\n  How can we make sense of all the evidence?\n  And how is evidence of the cost of drugs used in HTA?\n\n\nWe’ll also explore how the final HTA report fits within the wider range of information used to make decisions about which treatments to fund.\n\nLearn with HTA experts from The University of Sheffield\n\nThe educators for this course are based in the School of Health and Related Research at The University of Sheffield and are experts in this kind of research, so you will be learning from people who are actively involved in HTA and in developing the methods used.\n\nWe’ll show you the process using animated videos and interactive exercises, and by looking at an actual completed Health Technology Assessment that went on to inform healthcare decisions in the real world.\n\nUnderstand why new health technologies are funded\n\nBy the end of the course, you’ll be able to explain the process which leads to potential decisions on whether or not a new health technology is adopted and funded by the NHS or another national healthcare system. You’ll be able to make an informed contribution to a discussion about NHS decisions and form your own, knowledgable opinions about the subject.\n\nWhether you’re in the medical or pharmaceutical profession, studying or thinking of studying a subject such as medicine, nursing, healthcare or health economics, or simply an interested member of the public or a patient yourself, this course will give you the story behind the headlines. And you’ll be able to answer the question: how do healthcare systems make decisions about funding new treatments?\n\nYou can find out more about some of the themes covered in this course in Claire Beecroft’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “Penny pinchers or NICE people?

They will pose critical questions about how we deal with health, healing and being human.\n\nEach has been filmed on location in Cape Town, including at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, the Heart of Cape Town Museum, and the Pathology Learning Centre.\n\nDevelop and discuss your own ideas\n\nThe course will encourage you to discuss your ideas with learners all over the world, and reflect on the ways in which bodies, health, social life, culture and the imagination intersect in your local setting. Together, we’ll ask:\n\n\n  How is it that academic disciplines have become so rigid in their focus that they sometimes struggle to talk meaningfully to general audiences and other specialists?\n  And what potential can we unlock by combining different fields of expertise and the silos of knowledge that otherwise separate them?\n\n\nBy the end of the course, you’ll understand multiple, complex perspectives on health, illness and healing, and be able to create alternative responses to important health challenges.\n\nYou can find out more in Susan Levine and Steve Reid’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “Introducing medical humanities: a new, interdisciplinary approach to healthcare.”\n\n\n                                    ",

Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.\n\nAs the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.\n\nIn this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!\n\nAfter we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.\n\n                                    ",

In this course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with virtual patient interactions will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self¬-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your own life.\n\nTo help people who need to improve their health by changing their behaviors, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following sections will focus on coping with stress, improving sleep, increasing physical activity and everyday behaviors like hand washing, safer sex and minimizing risky alcohol use.\n\nTo complete this course, you will need to spend a total of about 30-40 hours. This time covers course videos, follow-up questions to help you remember what you have learned, course reading (mostly open access scientific articles) and homework tasks. Part of the work is for you to do on your own, and part will be together with other participants in the course community.\n\n                                    ",

National organizations, including the CDC and the Joint Commission, advocate for a formal “Antibiotic Timeout” to reassess empiric antibiotics 48-72 hours after their initiation. During this Timeout, clinicians should answer the following questions:\r\nDoes the patient have an infection that will respond to antibiotics?If so, is the patient on the right antibiotic(s) and is it being administered in the correct dose and by the correct route and (in the case of intravenous therapy) duration of infusion?Can a more targeted antibiotic regimen be used to treat the infection (i.e., de-escalation)?For how long should the antibiotic(s) be administered?This CME/CPE activity provides a practical approach to performing “Antibiotic Timeouts” in the inpatient setting. Using short, didactic sessions, we will provide examples on how to reassess antibiotic therapy started empirically using clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data. The majority of this CME/CPE will be high-yield, interactive inpatient cases covering skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, and neutropenic fever, that illustrate the timeout process and the principles of appropriate use of antimicrobials.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionEmpiric Antibiotic TherapyAntibiotic Timeout CasesCourse Wrap-upResources and ReferencesHelp!\n                                    ",

The critical questions then are:\n\n\n  how do we get the drug into the body?\n  how much needs to be taken?\n  and will it be safe enough as well as effective?\n\n\nWhat’s your experience?\n\nThe course will take an interactive approach, allowing you to both share your own experiences of medicines, and learn from experts in pharmacology and neuroscience. All jargon will be explained, so that you can join in without any specialist knowledge.\n\nYou can read more about the course in Alison Cooper’s blog post: “Have you ever wondered how drugs end up in a bottle in your medicine cabinet?”\n\nLearn more with the Good Brain, Bad Brain program\n\nThis course is the third of three in the Good Brain, Bad Brain program from the University of Birmingham. You can begin by looking at the basics of the human brain and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nWhen you complete all three courses and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will earn a FutureLearn Award as proof of completing the program of study.\n\n\n                                    ",

The overall course paradigm is the Institute of Medicine's vision of a \"Learning Health System\" that uses data from actual patient care to gain new knowledge and feeds that knowledge back as care is delivered to achieve a safer, higher quality and more cost effective health delivery system. Module 1 covers the US healthcare delivery system's unique structural, economic and policy issues and the strategic role for health informatics. It also looks at the federal programs to encourage adoption of electronic record systems. Module 2 gives a high level overview of some key health standards with a particular emphasis on the new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard. Module 3 explores how these technologies are being deployed and some of their current limitations using specific commercial and open source systems as examples. It features an interview with the developers of an innovative, new EHR. Module 4 presents examples of cutting edge research using \"big data\" and shows how analytic based tools are helping overcome some of the challenges posed in the prior module. It features an interview with developers of a innovative cloud-based service to bring together datasets and analytic tools from diverse sources. Optionally, as the course progresses, students read the instructor’s book, Practitioner's Guide to Health Informatics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WELCOME TO HEALTH INFORMATICS ON FHIRHealth informatics, broadly speaking, is the application of information technology to care delivery.  The field is arguably now at a \"tipping point\" because of the relatively recent widespread adoption of electronic record and other digital systems for use by both providers and patients.  Because of that, we are now, at least in theory, able to aggregate data from millions of patient encounters in order to analyze it to gain new knowledge and to obtain feedback on the quality and efficiency of the care those patients received.  Of course, it's not that simple and in this module we'll explore some of the unique structural issues of US healthcare and what the federal government has been doing to bridge those issues in order to create what the Institute of Medicine calls a \"learning health system\" -- a continuously improving system based on data from the applications of information technology just described.Data and Interoperability Standards To usefully aggregate and analyze data from thousands of electronic record systems and millions of patient encounters these systems need to be interoperable -- they need to be able to meaningfully share data.  It is generally agreed that accomplishing this requires standards. The degree to which they are critical is somewhat less clear now that computers are powerful enough to do sophisticated natural language processing.  However, it is likely that, for many years into the future, useful health data will be standardized to some degree.  In this module we'll explore the most commonly used health data standards and we'll briefly discuss how standardized data (along with free text) is packaged into standard electronic clinical documents and into messages to link together diverse systems in hospitals and beyond.  We'll focus on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), the new, rapidly evolving standard that offers to accelerate interoperability and even create a universal health app platform that could potentially help solve some of the challenges with current electronic record systems we'll discuss in Module 3.Real World Applications &amp; ChallengesWith the increased use of electronic health record and other digital health systems and tools it is increasingly clear that much work remains to be done to make those systems easier and more efficient to use.  These systems must also insure the privacy of patients and the security of the data they contain.  Finally, they should provide researchers and other secondary users with the highest possible data quality consistent with the practical needs of the providers entering that data.  In this module we'll explore all of these issues as they occur in real world systems.  We'll interview the developers of one of the most innovative new electronic health record systems to gain some insights into the future directions these systems may take.Big Data and AnalyticsDespite the many challenges we've discussed a great deal is already being done to aggregate and analyze health data from actual patient care for purposes such as improved diagnosis and treatment.  In this module we'll look at examples of that as well as some of the other exciting future opportunities in big health data and analytics.  We'll also see how analytic-based tools and systems can help overcome some of the challenges we introduced earlier including protecting patient privacy and security, helping to improve the quality of the data that is collected and making massive amounts of clinical data useful in daily clinical practice.\n                                    ",

C’est pour atteindre cet objectif que le cours s’appuie sur une approche pluridisciplinaire qui constitue une opportunité d'observer comment diverses disciplines abordent un même objet, selon différents angles et de manière complémentaire. Il s'agit également de donner des repères permettant d'appréhender le dopage dans sa complexité.\n\nLe dopage dans le sport est une pratique complexe dont la définition et l'identification renvoient à la construction sociale et historique de normes. \n\nLe cours propose une clarification des processus qui ont conduit à l'usage et la prohibition des produits dopants. L'amélioration des performances ou les transformations des apparences sont deux aspects du dopage qui dérangent alors que pourtant les sociétés vantent les mérites de \"l'amélioration\" du corps et que les marchés du \"human enhancement\" prospèrent. Ces apparentes contradictions seront analysées en montrant que, au-delà des questions sanitaires, le dopage est au croisement de multiples enjeux sociaux, scientifiques ou encore juridiques.\n\nPour y faire face, les autorités sportives et étatiques ont contribué à la mise en place d’institutions en charge de l'identification du dopage, de politiques de prévention, de répression et de recherche. Les dispositifs biologiques de contrôle comme le passeport biologique, les dimensions juridiques qui fondent la lutte contre le dopage, les organisations de production de la performance, comme les dimensions sociologiques du dopage seront abordés par ce cours.\n\nOutre les enseignants de l’Université de Lausanne, les meilleurs spécialistes du dopage, d’un laboratoire antidopage (LAD), du TAS (Tribunal Arbitral du Sport), de l’UEFA (football) et de l’AMA (Agence Mondiale Antidopage) interviennent dans ce cours. \n\nTeaser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ZQVQsWAdo \n\nObjectifs pédagogiques principaux :\n\nA la fin de ce cours les participants seront capables de:\n\n1.\tIdentifier la dimension « culturelle » du dopage, c’est-à-dire comme pratique qui a une histoire en lien avec la transformation de normes sociales\n\n2.\tPasser d’un mode de raisonnement binaire sur le dopage, pour ou contre, à la compréhension de la complexité d’un phénomène à la fois biologique, psychologique et sociologique\n\n3.\tReconnaître les institutions, les acteurs et les pratiques de lutte contre le dopage\n\n4.\tExpliquer comment le contexte social et organisationnel pèse sur les décisions des individus et comment il peut être réduit par des mesures de prévention. \n\n5.\tIdentifier comment fonctionne la lutte contre le dopage et les procédures de contrôle\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1- Identification et définition du dopageLe premier module porte sur l’identification et la définition du dopage. Il propose une approche critique et distanciée en s’appuyant sur les sciences sociales. Il permet de comprendre le dopage comme une norme sociale de production des performances sportives. L’historique du dopage et sa définition actuelle selon les normes juridiques de l’Agence Mondiale Antidopage (AMA) y sont abordés.Module 2- Pourquoi les sportifs se dopent-ils ?Le module 2 vise à comprendre ce qui peut conduire des individus ordinaires à prendre des produits dopants. L’analyse des processus qui conduisent au dopage est abordée à travers les facteurs sociaux et psycho-sociaux du dopage, ainsi que le rôle de la culture et des organisations sportives. Ce module inclut un entretien avec Denis Hauw, Professeur à l’Institut des Sciences du Sport de l’Université de Lausanne et spécialiste en psychologie du sport.Module 3- Les organisations face au dopageLe module 3 propose de mieux connaître le rôle des organisations sportives dans la lutte contre le dopage, à partir de deux exemples, celui de l’Union européenne des associations de football (UEFA) et de l’UCI (Union cycliste internationale). Ce module traite également du rôle des organisations spécialisées en charge de la lutte contre le dopage en présentant deux acteurs majeurs l’AMA (l’Agence mondiale antidopage) et le TAS (Tribunal arbitral du sport), dont une partie des activités porte sur le dopage. La présentation de ces organisations se fait par le biais de 4 entretiens avec :- Frédéric Donzé, Directeur du Bureau européen de l’AMA ; -Marc Vouillamoz, Responsable de l’unité médicale et antidopage de l’UEFA ; -Matthieu Reeb, Secrétaire Général du TAS ; -Olivier Aubel, Maître d'enseignement et de recherche à l’Institut des Sciences du Sport de l’Université de Lausanne qui présente des nouveaux dispositifs proposés à l’UCI pour prévenir le dopage dans le cyclisme.Module 4- Les approches bioanalytiques et forensiques du dopageLe module 4 présente les moyens d’analyse et de détection des substances dopantes par l’utilisation d’approches bioanalytiques et forensiques. Il est composé de 4 entretiens réalisés avec les spécialistes du dopage du Laboratoire suisse d’analyse du dopage (LAD) à Lausanne (Suisse) qui proposent de vous expliquer :   - le déroulement des bioanalyses (Norbert Baume, responsable scientifique du LAD);  -\tle passeport biologique (Neil Robinson, responsable scientifique du LAD);  - l’approche forensique du dopage (François Marclay, chercheur au LAD);  - les résultats d’analyse atypiques et des évolutions futures de la lutte contre le dopage (Martial Saugy, directeur du LAD).\n                                    ",

The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.\nThe course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs. We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment. In the second half of the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted. Finally, we will review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments on people.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Types of Trial DesignsThis week, we explore different types of trial designs, including parallel, crossover, group allocation, factorial, large simple, equivalency, non-inferiority, and adaptive designs.Randomization and MaskingThis week we discuss two key design features of randomized clinical trials used to protect against bias, randomization and masking.Outcomes and AnalysisThis week focuses on a key design issue - selecting the primary outcome. We will also cover the gold standard for analysis of clinical trials, which is including all the participants in the analysis regardless of their actual treatment.EthicsThis week focuses on a key issue in the field of clinical trials, the ethics of experimentation in humans. Reporting ResultsThis week, we focus on reporting results of clinical trials in publications. We cover the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.Randomized Clinical TrialsThis week, we focus on whether RCTs are still the gold standard for evaluating evidence. \n                                    ",

You may be a clinical practitioner reading research articles to keep up-to-date with developments in your field or a medical student wondering how to approach your own research. Greater confidence in understanding statistical analysis and the results can benefit both working professionals and those undertaking research themselves. \n\nIf you are simply interested in properly understanding the published literature or if you are embarking on conducting your own research, this course is your first step. It offers an easy entry into interpreting common statistical concepts without getting into nitty-gritty mathematical formulae. To be able to interpret and understand these concepts is the best way to start your journey into the world of clinical literature. That’s where this course comes in - so let’s get started!\n\nThe course is free to enroll and take. You will be offered the option of purchasing a certificate of completion which you become eligible for, if you successfully complete the course requirements. This can be an excellent way of staying motivated!  Financial Aid is also available.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Getting things started by defining study typesWelcome to the first week of this course. We’ll be tackling five broad topics to provide you with an intuitive understanding of clinical research results. This isn’t a comprehensive statistics course, but it offers a practical orientation to the field of medical research and commonly used statistical analysis. The first topics will look at research methods and the collection of data - with a specific focus on study types. By the end of the lectures you should be able to identify which study types are being used and why the researchers selected them when you are reading a paper.Describing your data With the next topics, we finally get started with the statistics. Have you ever looked at the methods and results section of any healthcare research publication and noted the variety of statistical tests used?  You would have come across terms like t-test, Mann-Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon test, Fisher’s exact test and the ubiquitous chi-squared test.  Why so many tests you might wonder?  It’s all about types of data.  In this week,  I am going to tackle the differences in data which determine what type of statistical test we can use in making sense of our data.Building an intuitive understanding of statistical analysisThere is hardly any healthcare professional who is unfamiliar with the p-value.  It is usually understood to have a watershed value of 0.05.  If a research question is evaluated through the collection of data points and statistical analysis reveals a value less that 0.05, we accept this a proof that some significant difference was found, at least statistically.In reality things are a bit more complicated than that.  The literature is currently full of questions about the ubiquitous p-vale and why it is not the panacea many of us have used it as. During this week you will develop an intuitive understanding of concept of a p-value. From there, I'll move on to the heart of probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem and data distribution.The important first steps: Hypothesis testing and confidence levelsIn general, a researcher has a question in mind that he or she needs an answer to.  Everyone might have an opinion on the question (or answer), but an investigator looks for the answer by designing an experiment and investigating the outcome. In the first lesson we will look at hypotheses and how they relate to ethical and unbiased research and reporting.We'll also tackle Confidence intervals which I believe are one of the least understood and often misrepresented values in healthcare research. The most common tests used in the literature to compare numerical data point values are t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression.  In the last lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions. Which test should you use?The most common statistical test that you might come across in the literature is the t-test.  There are, in actual fact, a few t-tests, but the one most are familiar with, is of course, Student’s t-test and its ubiquitous p-value.  Not everyone, though, knows that the name Student was actually a pseudonym, used by William Gosset (1876 - 1937).  Parametric tests have very strict assumptions that must be met before their use is justified.  In this lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions.  Once you know these, you will be able to identify when these tests are used inappropriately.Categorical data and analyzing accuracy of results Congratulations! You've reached the final week of the course Understanding Clinical Research. In this lesson we will take a look at how good tests are at picking up the presence or absence of disease, helping us choose appropriate tests, and how to interpret positive and negative results.  We’ll decipher sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. You'll end of this course with a final exam, to test the knowledge and application you've learned in this course. I hope you've enjoyed this course and it helps your understanding of clinical research. \n                                    ",

The core curriculum introduces learners to a global perspective on gender based violence (GBV), and includes a review with Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno of the new WHO guidelines on responding to violence. Students who wish to receive Honors Recognition will complete the honors module, which expands on the core material and highlights special circumstances and programs. \n\nThis is an in-depth course with 2 components: \n1) Core curriculum introduces GBV from a global perspective, with an emphasis on ensuring a strong health sector response to GBV and teaching key competencies for social workers, physicians, nurses, midwives, community health workers, counselors, and other healthcare workers. Completion of the core content is required for students to pass the course. \n2) Honors curriculum offered by experts from around the world helps students dive deeper into certain issues, and touches on unique populations and specialized topics. Completion of Honors curriculum is required for those students who wish to receive a Certificate of Accomplishment with Honors.\n\nAfter taking the course, students will be able to:\n●\tDescribe the global epidemiology of leading forms of GBV and the evidence linking GBV to poor health.\n●\tArticulate the challenges, strategies, and WHO guidelines for integrating GBV response within the health sector. \n●\tDescribe the components of a comprehensive clinical assessment, treatment, and management of a GBV survivor.\n●\tDescribe the appropriate psychosocial support and management of a GBV survivor.\n\nModule 1 – Introduction to GBV- Epidemiology and Health Impact\nGBV comes in a variety of forms, each with health consequences for the survivor. An understanding of these issues helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 – Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 – Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module – In-Depth Information and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon, and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and human trafficking. Further information is provided on epidemiology, policy, and ethical guidelines, as well as the use of mHealth in GBV screening and care. We’ll cover the unique challenges of GBV research, and explore programs that encourage men and boys to be engaged in the prevention of violence against women. \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis course is a project of the Johns Hopkins Center for Clinical Global Health Education.

Knowledge is power, and this course will provide you with a deep understanding of the problems and the solutions. You can become part of the solution.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction: Who is Caring for Mary?100,000 patients die annually as a consequence of preventable medical errors, and over 1 million patients suffer life-changing injuries. Despite the calls to action medical errors continue at the rate of 1 out of 10 patients. How can those of us who help to deliver care and those of us that receive care help to prevent harm? There are 5 fundamental areas each of us needs to understand and use to fix healthcare delivery:   1. Apply the principles of high performing manufacturers and athletic teams to continually improve our processes. 2.We all need to learn how lead and be part of multidisciplinary teams that include patients and coordinate the care they receive.   3.The human brain continually makes errors. Certain conditions increase the likelihood of errors, and these need to be avoided. Systems can be designed that force the right behavior, and second checks can help caregivers provide the right care at the right time and in the right place. 4.We all need to become effective leaders. Most importantly we must practice adaptive leadership, that is, leadership that promotes a true change in the way things are done. 5.Finally we all can utilize the campaign methods of successful politicians and advocacy groups to change the attitudes of our fellow caregivers and patients, and thereby change the culture of our healthcare systems. During this 8-module course you will be provided with the tools to accomplish all 5 of these goals, and as an individual you can truly make a difference.\nWhy do we need to understand about systems? How do we evaluate a system and as a patient or provider what characteristics do you think are important? How does quality relate to safety? These are important questions that we all need to have answers to as we learn how to improve how we deliver and receive healthcare. The personal consequences of distracted physicians and defective systems are illustrated in Mary's frightening hospital experience.Applying Manufacturing Principles to Improve HealthcareIn this module we will be discussing the manufacturing principles of the Toyota Production System. The concept of value stream or work flow diagrams will be introduced. The well known 80/20 rule in manufacturing will be applied to patient care. The 8 ways waste can be reduced in health care will be explored, and finally the problem of push medicine and how patients can guard against this all too common problem will be covered.Healthcare Requires TeamworkTeamwork is critical in modern healthcare. We will explore the state of healthcare teamwork in most healthcare systems. The 5 resources required for effective teams will be reviewed, and we will discuss how athletic principles can be used to encourage teamwork, improve efficiency and increase the quality of patient care. We will review how to launch and coach a team, and how to manage the complex dynamics of teams. Finally we will discuss how to create a self-improving team.Understanding and Preventing Human Error Part IThis module will be discussing the consequences of medical errors, and you will learn from Sorrel King's loss of her daughter, Josie, and from my personal experience that preventable injuries not only cause death but also can lead to permanent life changing injuries. Sitting around and doing nothing is not an option. However we all need to understand and use three key tools to determine the causes of medical errors and to fix them, Root cause analysis, Driver Diagrams, and PDSA cycles. Finally we will discuss the issue of small errors and our tendency to ignore and workaround them. Unfortunately this approach to small problems is one of leading causes for the continued high rate of preventable injuries and deaths in our hospitals and clinics. It is time to fix the little things.\nUnderstanding and Preventing Human Error Part IIThis module introduces you to the famous W. Edwards Deming red bead experiment that illustrates the tyranny of random variation, and introduce the use of run charts to differentiate random or common cause from specific cause variation. Next we will introduce you the concept of reliability and will illustrate why we need to dramatically improve the reliability in health care. Strategies for reducing human errors are reviewed, and the effectiveness hierarchy of different interventions discussed. We end with a discussion of how health systems and providers should be treating patients and families who they have inadvertently harmed.We All Can Lead: Becoming an Adaptive LeaderIn this module, we will be discussing the need in healthcare for distributive leadership that is adaptive. The complexity of healthcare prevents one leader from micromanaging a healthcare system, and leadership must be encouraged on the front lines of care. Effective leaders are good listeners, empathetic, follow their principles (North Star) and are courageous. Adaptive or innovative leaders are a necessity for improving the quality and safety of healthcare. The strategies for controlling emotional disequilbrium will be addressed, and specific analogies presented to assist students in understanding how to practice leadership that will bring about change.How Organizing People can Drive Change in Healthcare DeliveryChange requires those on the front lines to embrace new approaches to care and to work across department barriers. This session will use our Founding Father Samuel Adams to exemplify the approaches that have been used for decades to encourage others to come together to bring about change. Samuel Adams campaign led to United States independence from Great Britain and these methods if applied throughout the world can lead to a revolution in healthcare delivery. One-one techniques, personal narrative, creation of leadership teams, and the creation of effective strategies and tactics to bring about action will all be covered. You can make a difference.Immunity to Change, Examples of Successful Patient Care Initiatives, and Final SummaryIn this final module we will review why many of us fail to change our viewpoints and behavior. We will discuss how you can overcome your natural immunity to change. Next we will review the key points from each of the past 7 module, and then outline a general plan of action that will allow you to create your personal plan to fix one component of your healthcare system. Your learning has just begun. Now you will be able to apply what you learned, you will achieve greater and greater understanding by doing.Final ExamThis is the final exam. \n                                    ",

Although this unit may seem trivial, knowing when to make the decision to do surgery, having a good informed consent discussion, selecting an intraocular lens and anesthetic type are critical to a successful surgery and happy patient.Unit 2: In the Operating Room and Getting to the CataractThis unit begins in the operating room after the patient is prepped and draped. It covers each step needed for you to access the lens. Once you begin operating, you will realize that each step of surgery has a domino effect. If the beginning steps are not done skillfully, it will make the rest of the case more difficult.Unit 3: Removing the Cataract and Intraocular Lens PlacementThis unit is where all the fun begins. The lectures cover lens and cortex removal. We also discuss intraocular lenses and their insertion into the eye. While lens removal is the most critical step of surgery, it is also where the most serious complications occur, so pay attention!Unit 4: Cataract Complications and ExtrasThis unit covers some additional tools and strategies you will need to manage complications and difficult cataracts.

The course is structured as a journey, taking as its starting point a person or couple wanting to conceive and using these types of technologies to who want to make a baby but can’t do so , due to their infertility, advanced age, sexuality or lack of partner.\n\nUnderstand the choices that surround assisted reproduction\n\nAs soon as anyone decides to use reproductive technology to help them to have biological offspring, they are often confronted with a dizzying array of choices and dilemmas:\n\n\n  to have a sperm or egg donor;\n  to choose a known or an anonymous donor;\n  to test the fetus for genetic abnormalities;\n  to use a surrogate (and, if so, in an ethical way);\n  to test the embryo or baby for genetic abnormalities;\n  and whether to use new technologies that allow genome editing\n\n\nAll of these issues pose urgent ethical challenges. But who decides what’s right or wrong? Who is potentially harmed? And how is this changing our society?\n\nExplore the challenges posed by reproductive technology\n\nMaking Babies in the 21st Century will look at human reproduction in an age where reproductive technology is becoming the norm, exploring the social, ethical and legal challenges that currently confront us. The course will enable you to:\n\n\n  explore how technology is changing the way babies are made and how family life is constructed;\n  appreciate the key ethical dilemmas that these new technologies bring;\n  and gain awareness of the social aspects of the relevant ethical challenges\n\n\nLearn with UCL’s Institute for Women’s Health\n\nThe course has been created by Dr Dan Reisel, a research associate and clinical research fellow in Women’s Health at UCL.\n\nThe content of the course grows out of the ethics teaching at the Institute for Women’s Health, and brings together clinicians, scientists, patient advocates and students interested in the ethical and social implications of the new reproductive and genomic technologies.\n\n\n                                    ",

Costs are fairly straightforward to calculate, but what about benefits? How do we know which treatments help patients most? And how do we measure and value these benefits?\n\nUnderstand Patient Reported Outcome Measures and Quality Adjusted Life Years\n\nThis free online course will introduce you to health outcomes and explain how they can be measured and valued, to make more informed decisions about where to spend our limited healthcare budgets.\n\nWe’ll look at two different types of measures, asking how they’re developed and calculated, and how they’re used by decision makers in practice:\n\n\n  \n    Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs): which are measures completed by the patients themselves, about their health, symptoms, functioning, well-being or satisfaction with treatment.\n  \n  \n    Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs): which compare the benefits of different treatment options, based on the quality and quantity of life they yield.\n  \n\n\nLearn and debate with specialists in health economics\n\nOver 3 weeks, you’ll learn with Dr Katherine Stevens, Dr Clara Mukuria and other specialists from the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield.\n\nYou’ll also get to share your experiences and debate the key issues with other learners. Should it be patients or the general population who value our health? Or someone else? And should we value children’s health differently?\n\nThis course will help you understand how and why choices about drugs and treatments have been made. It may inspire you to think about a career in healthcare, local decision making or academia.\n\nYou may even wish to take your learning further, with the University of Sheffield’s Masters degrees and short courses in areas such as health economics, public health and international healthcare technology assessment.\n\nYou can find out more about this subject in Dr Katherine Stevens’ post for the FutureLearn blog: “How do we make decisions in healthcare about which drugs and treatments to fund?”\n\n\n                                    ",

Charter schools now serve over five percent of the public school population, voucher programs have been introduced in many states, and digital education has captured the attention of educators across the country. What is the theoretical basis for these innovations? How effective are the early initiatives? How do parents decide what is best for their children? And how do all of these options affect the students who remain in traditional public schools?\n\nWith the help of several scholars and participants in these new ventures, we will discuss the ways in which these school choice initiatives are re-shaping U. S. education.\n\nThis mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also includes assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.\n\nThis is the fourth mini-course in a four-course sequence.\n\nMini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education\n\tMini-Course 2: Teacher Policies\n\tMini-Course 3: Accountability and National Standards\n\tMini-Course 4: School Choice\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.\n\nIn the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016.\n\nEach mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos.

How do we recruit and retain the very best teachers?

You may remember how painful this experience was. Millions of children around the world are excluded from access to education because of a disability - their exclusion robs them of their potential and diminishes our society.\n\nUnderstand inclusive education and disability\n\nInclusive education is about addressing barriers to learning and participation and transforming school communities to allow them to really benefit from inclusion. Although inclusive education is about all forms of diversity, on this course you learn specifically about disability - as it is often an aspect of diversity that is neglected.\n\nFind out how to create an inclusive environment\n\nAccess to education for children with disabilities has been a challenge in many countries, with problems ranging from lack of resources, discriminatory policies, cultural and social prejudice, as well as the lack of practical support for educators and parents.\n\nThis course aims to help teachers, other professionals and parents to tackle inclusion, in a practical way, in their own environment. Over six weeks, we will look at the background of disability and strategies for creating an enabling environment in the school and community.\n\nYou will learn in a variety of ways, from short video lectures, readings and discussions, to online quizzes. Each will introduce different perspectives in the inclusive education framework and help you to apply inclusive education in your own context.\n\nLearn from people with experience of disability\n\nFrom challenging perceptions of disability to everyday classroom practices, this course will offer you insights from a range of people who have worked with disabled children - parents, teachers, facilitators, occupational and allied therapists and school principals.\n\nYou will also learn from established educators. Dr Judith McKenzie is a lecturer and researcher at the University of Cape Town who has taught and published extensively on disability and inclusive education; she has worked in rural areas focusing on community based and interdisciplinary efforts to address disability, exclusion and poverty.\n\nChioma Ohajunwa has a B.Ed in Special Education and Language Arts and an MPhil in Disability Studies and has worked in various contexts ranging from educare for disabled children in Nigeria and Liberia, to disabilities studies in South African higher education.\n\nIn the words of American educator, Dr Kevin Maxwell, “Our job is to teach the kids we have. Not the ones we would like to have. Not the ones we used to have. Those we have right now…all of them.”  This course will help you teach all of our children, right now.\n\nCourse outline:\n\n●      Week 1 - Why inclusion?\n●      Week 2 - Education begins at home\n●      Week 3 - Creating an inclusive school \n●      Week 4 - Partnerships for success\n●      Week 5 - Changing classroom practices\n●      Week 6 - Building networks\n\n\n                                    ",

Bonus: Students enrolled in this Coursera course will also be invited to many onsite and online events, workshops, and conferences offered by more than fifty learning institutions around the world, as part of an initiative on Shaping the Future of Higher Education.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nLearning Objectives\n\n\n    Understand how and why we inherited the Industrial Age educational systems.\n    Think deeply about the requirements of the world we live in now.\n    Discover new ideas, methods, competencies, and subject matter.\n    Share our pathways to successful innovation with others around the world.  Together, we can change schools, classrooms, institutions, learning--and maybe ourselves!  \n    \n\nWEEK ONE - January 27, 2014Guiding Principles and Driving Concepts - Let’s Get Started\n    This week we will think about the uses of history: learning how and why educational institutions were constructed in the past helps us think about what we need now, in order to begin to shape a different future of education in order to help shape a more just future for all.\nWEEK TWO - February 3, 2014The iPod Experiment: Or, Learning vs. Education\n    Duke University’s iPod experiment became international news.  Why?  What happens when students are in charge?  What happens when education begins at a place where no one (not even the instructor) knows the answer in advance? What if\n    the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?  This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning.\n    \n\n\nWEEK THREE - February 10, 2014Teaching Like It’s 1992    \n    The World changed on April 22, 1993, when the scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released the Internet and the World Wide Web to the general public.  From then on, anyone with access to an Internet connection could\n    communicate  to anyone else with an Internet connection.  No editor or publisher provides a safety net now and, at the same time, our data can be hacked, our privacy invaded.  The digital world we live in now comes with tremendous responsibilities and opportunity--and yet it comes with real inequalities, perils, and obstacles too.  Does our educational system prepare us for these challenges?\n    \n\n\n\nWEEK FOUR - February 17, 2014Welcome to the Future: 10 Ways to Change the Paradigm of Higher Education\n    We will now be looking at different principles, methods and metrics for redesigning an innovative form of learning that helps us all navigate the complexities of the world we inhabit outside of school.  This week we focus specifically on innovations\n    to the curriculum.\n    \n\n\n\nWEEK FIVE - February 24, 2014Innovations in Pedagogy (Methods) and Assessment\n    This week we will focus on innovations in pedagogy (the methods for learning) and assessment.  How you teach is what you teach.  And, we need to think deeply about what we value and make sure what we value is what we count.    \n    \n\nWEEK SIX - March 3, 2014How to Make Institutional Change \n    Even if we make changes in our personal learning and teaching methods, we still have to work mostly within institutions of learning.  Institutional change can be difficult; it takes patience, strategy, and allies. This week offers (and also invites)\n    ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.  This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds.  \n\n\n\nConclusion: Thank you for joining this movement on behalf of educational innovation and reform!  This is not the end.  It’s the beginning.  Where will we do from here? Let’s get started! \n    \n\n\n                                    ",

The UCL Institute of Education, University of London (IOE http://www.ioe.ac.uk/)  and the UNESCO Institute for IT in\nEducation (IITE http://iite.unesco.org/ ) are collaborating to run this professional development course\nfor teachers, headteachers and policymakers working in the Primary Education\nsector.\n\nThe course is part of IITE’s role to support and promote an\nactive community of practitioners and policymakers in the use of digital\ntechnologies for learning and teaching.\n\nIt is also linked to the UCL IOE’s mission to promote excellence in education and\nprofessional practice through advancing knowledge and understanding.  \n\nThe resources for the course are derived from teachers’ Primary\npractice in different countries. The UNESCO IITE funded an international\nproject to collect practices, experiences, policies, cases and data from several\ncountries in different parts of the world. The outcome is two volumes\nsummarising the findings. The basis of the course is therefore not a\nparticular theoretical approach, but a collection of good and interesting\nexperiences and exemplars of ICT in primary education from across the world.\nWhat unites all the authors and teachers involved in the project is our\nconviction that ICT, used well, by good teachers, alongside other methods, can\nenable every child to achieve their learning potential.Announcement for US based teachers:Coursera and its partners are proud to\noffer eligible teachers free verified certificates for this\ncourse and other high-quality teacher professional development courses, through\nthe ConnectED effort announced by President Obama.\n\nTo participate in this opportunity, district leaders simply need\nto approve Coursera teacher professional development by completing a brief form\nat: www.coursera.org/tpd.\n\nTeachers interested in this opportunity are also encouraged to\nfollow the link to learn more and complete the form.  \n\nOnce a district’s form has been verified, the district leader will\nbe notified and teachers in the district will receive access to free verified\ncertificates for Coursera professional development.\n\nCoursera and its partners thank educators\nfor the hard work they do every day and hope this opportunity will allow them\nto continue developing their craft in a meaningful and flexible way.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\n    The 21st Century Primary SchoolOrientationWhy should we consider using ICT in primary schools?The 21st Century school environmentSupporting teachers' needsReflecting on the lessons learnedHow does ICT make a difference?OrientationDimensions of change within the schoolBeyond the school - national and international connectionsChildren's perspectivesReflecting on the weekPedagogical changes achievable through ICTOrientationIntegreation of ICT into the teaching and learning processMeeting curriculum objectives and skills developmentPlanning and preparing activities with ICTPersonalisation, scope, and assessmentReflecting on the weekTechnology opportunitiesOrientationChoosing the technologyIntegrating the LMSDigital content: using, choosing, getting, buying, sharing, and developingFuture plansReflecting on the weekHow to overcome the challenges of ICT in primary educationOrientationPractical aspects of using ICT activities wellHow to overcome challenges and obstaclesReflecting on the weekMaking ICT work\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    OrientationReflecting on issues and challengesPromising practicesCase studies from the front line of teaching with ICTReflecting on the course\n\nLearning Outcomes\nThe intended learning outcomes are:\n\n\n    The primary school teaching community to be able to contribute to the integration of a range of effective ICT-based practices and pedagogies.\n    School leaders to be able to develop, improve, and share the strategies and mechanisms that optimise the development of ICT-based teaching and learning in their school.\n    Policymakers and schools-related stakeholders, agencies and companies to be able to support head teachers and specialist staff in developing pedagogy-led and problem-led uses of ICT.To become familiar with a wider range of useful tools and resources for integrating ICT.\n\n\nInstructors\nProfessor Diana Laurillard (UCL Institute of Education, University of London, UK)Professor Ivan Kalaš (Slovak Republic)Dr Ernesto Laval (Chile)Professor Cher Ping Lim (Hong Kong)Professor Florian Meyer (Canada)Professor Abtar Darshan Singh (UAE)Professor Márta Turcsányi-Szabó (Hungary)Natalia Tokareva (Russian Federation)Please see Profile pages for contact \nAdvisors\nLynn Roberts, Tim Neumann, Paul Thompson (all UCL Institute of Education, University of London, UK)\n                                    ",

However, although the basic raw material is the reasoning, it is exaggerated in the proliferation of proposals in multiple ways, coupled with restricted vision of the potential of the human brain. We are firm in the belief that intelligence is developed as universal knowledge, and a reconstruction of education and cognitive approaches that support them in order to promote sustained growth and strengthening is needed.\r\nUnfortunately, its impact on the daily practice demonstrates that every day we depend more on new proposals for the solution of problems, which are costly to be implemented in companies that face. Such is the case of Reasoning or Disruptive Thinking, or CPS Creative Problem Solving.\r\nThat is why we consider it urgent that the educational models consider the need to train students in this line, and in the case of companies or institutions, reflect on this issue.\r\nMIRM competitive advantages are: 1. Encompass under a single approach, the different currents of thought, such as: Convergent, divergent or parallel, Critic, Intuitive, disruptive, etc. 2.

Maybe you’re already working with a group doing social impact work in an established organization/NGO. Or perhaps you have an idea for a social initiative and want to team up with others, locally or virtually. Or maybe you’re just concerned about the direction the world is heading and want to join a global conversation about creating some positive, sustainable change. If so, this first ever GROOC is for you.\n\nOur GROOC has a distinct pedagogy: we believe profound learning happens when people share their experiences with each other, ask questions and tell stories. It’s called social learning. There are no right or wrong answers and no tests along the way. Instead, you’ll delve into relevant issues that concern all social initiatives, at any stage of development.\n\nOver seven sessions, you will be exposed to concepts and models from our four course designers and will hear from top international scholars and practitioners who combine the best thinking with the most effective doing. Plus, you’ll have access to more than 20 “deep dive” interviews with fascinating individuals who are at the forefront of creating social change, including Muhammad Yunus, Mary Gordon, Marshall Ganz, and many more.\n\nThe goal of our GROOC is simple: to inspire the creation of social initiatives that will help rebalance society. Join us to engage in meaningful social learning with a worldwide network of people who want to create a better world together.\n\n                                    ",

Though libraries have been loved for over 3,600 years, their relevance in the digital age is being questioned, and their economic and social impacts are poorly understood. What is really essential about libraries and librarians, today and tomorrow? How can library members and all who support the mission of 21st-century librarianship raise the profile and support of these timeless values and services, and ensure universal access to the universe of ideas in all our communities? This course is based on what works. We’ll take an inspired, strategic, evidence-based approach to advocacy for the future of strong communities – cities, villages, universities and colleges, research and development centres, businesses, and not-for-profits.\nWe will cover:\n\nValues and transformative impacts of libraries and librarianship\n\tResearch on current perceptions of libraries and librarians\n\tRole of relationships in advocacy\n\tPrinciples of influence and their impact on advocacy\n\tStrategic thinking and planning in advocacy\n\tEffective communication: messages, messengers, and timing\nGuest speakers share their ideas, recommendations and successes. These leading advocates include, among others: \n\nBarbara Band, Emmbrook School, Berkshire\n\tCathy De Rosa, OCLC\n\tKen Haycock, University of Southern California\n\tJoe Janes, University of Washington\n\tNancy Kranich, Rutgers University\n\tVictoria Owen, University of Toronto\n\tJohn Szabo, Los Angeles Public Library\nPrevious participants have said that this course – “showed me the value of building relationships,” and “made me approach our library’s advocacy much differently”, and “helped me see advocacy in a new light.\"\nAdvocacy is growing in urgency and importance on the agenda of all library associations.  In this highly competitive environment, associations help their members and their communities to build advocacy capacity.  This course meets that strategic need. It is offered in partnership with the Canadian Library Association and the American Library Association.\n\n \n\n\"\n\nFor the full description, please see the syllabus at:http://courses.edx.org/c4x/University_of_TorontoX/LA101x_2/asset/LA101X__2015__Syllabus.docx\n\n                                    ",

From notions of 'global competency' and 'international branch campuses,' to ever more common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking that are framed and operate at a global scale, contexts are changing. This massive open online course (MOOC) itself, developed in Madison and Bristol and hosted on the Coursera platform in Silicon Valley, is a perfect case in point!Globalizing Higher Education and Research for the ‘Knowledge Economy’ is designed to help students better understand some of these complex changes. Our specific objectives are to:Provide an integrated 'big picture' regarding the globalization of higher education and research.  Reinforce the value of thinking about processes of change by focusing on emergences -- the forward edges of change -- as well as the frictions associated with these processes. We attempt to make this tangible by highlighting the role of relevant logics, thinkers, institutions, networks, technologies, ideas, temporalities, and regulations.Highlight the role of relative and variable forms of power in shaping agendas and practices, as well as uneven development patterns and outcomes.In the end, we hope to stimulate some exciting globally oriented learning about how the higher education sector - from research to teaching, learning, and service (the 'third mission') - are changing. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Universities (Starting Monday 24 March)Keywords: collaboration, competition, global competency, globalization, internationalization, learning, logics, mechanisms, mission, mobility, models, technologyWeek 2: City-regions (Starting Monday 31 March)Keywords: academic freedom, branch campuses, cities, city-regions, competition, hubs, gateway cities, global cities, innovation systems, liberal arts colleges, mobility, R&amp;D, networks, urbanization.Week 3: Nations (Starting Monday 7 April)Keywords: competition, denationalization, exports, mobility, nation-state, revenue, services, studentsWeek 4: Regions (Starting Monday 14 April)Keywords: collaboration, competition, geopolitics, higher education areas, interregionalism, regionalismWeek 5: Globals (Starting Monday 21 April)Keywords: assessment, benchmarking, competition, desectoralization, framing, governance, hegemony, knowledge, intergovernmental organizations, publishing, R&amp;D, rankings, thinkersWeek 6: World Class (Starting Monday 28 April)Keywords: assessment, benchmarking, bibliometrics, competition, desectoralization, governance, metrics, models, world class universities, world university rankingsWeek 7: Singapore (Starting Monday 5 May)Keywords: academic freedom, branch campuses, city-state, competition, developmental state, global cities, hubs, innovation systems, nation-states, networks, R&amp;D, rankings, regionalism, services\n                                    ",

Couple this with the regular external inspections that schools in many countries receive, and there are growing pressures on all PE teachers to reach the highest levels of performance.\n\nThis free online course is designed to help PE teachers achieve and sustain these levels. It defines an “outstanding” physical education lesson as one that meets the diverse learning needs of all of its students at a point in time and in a specific context.\n\nBecome an “activator” and deliver outstanding PE lessons\n\nThe course begins with a guided, expert analysis of students’ needs, local and national curriculum requirements, and teachers’ personal readiness to deliver outstanding PE lessons. Throughout, PE teachers will be positioned as “activators” – practitioners who activate new, inclusive learning possibilities for their students.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will:\n\n\n  understand the characteristics of an outstanding physical education lesson;\n  know and be able to engage with the process of being an activator of learning;\n  develop the capabilities to engage in self-directed continuous professional development (CPD) using a range of digital tools.\n\n\nLearn with physical education CPD experts\n\nThe course has been developed by the School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Birmingham. It is led by Dr Victoria Goodyear, who has extensive experience of supporting physical education teachers, through online CPD, video blogging and social media.\n\n\n                                    ",

We have\nthe chance to help them find answers. \n\nLearning analytics is about using\ndata to improve teaching and learning. You might wonder why there’s suddenly so\nmuch conversation about this previously invisible topic.[1] After\nall, institutions of higher education have maintained careful records of\nstudent progress and outcomes for more than a century.  They have always been ready to provide a\ntranscript for every student, reporting all courses taken, grades received,\nhonors awarded, and degrees conferred. Institutional research offices provide\nsummaries of these student records to campus leaders, accreditation agencies,\nand the public. Why learning analytics now?\n\nTwo major trends drive the\ncurrent emergence of learning analytics. First, data informing teaching and\nlearning are increasingly extensive and accessible. Second, innovative new analytic\napproaches to digesting, visualizing, and acting on these data emerge every day.What’s special about this\ncourse?Practical Learning Analytics has a specific goal: to help us\ncollectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way. To keep it practical,\nwe will focus on using traditional student record data, the kinds of data every\ncampus already has. To make it interesting, we will address questions raised by\nan array of different stakeholders, including campus leaders, faculty, staff,\nand especially students. To provide analytic teeth, each analysis we discuss\nwill be supported by both realistic data and sample code.Who should take this course?Practical Learning Analytics should provide something for anyone\ninterested in higher education: current, former, or future students, policy\nmakers, academic advisors, data scientists, university administrators, ed-tech\nentrepreneurs, faculty members, even the curious public. This course has been designed to\nwork for a wide variety of audiences. Its structure is modeled on something\neveryone can enjoy: a smörgåsbord –\nwe’re going to treat the class like one big meal. After we set the table, each\nguest may wander the room, taking either a small plate or a full entrée from a\nseries of courses we offer up. When everyone is full, we’ll gather again over\ncoffee to hear what people thought. There is no defined way to pursue such a\nmeal – each diner chooses what’s right for them. And there is no defined way to\ntake this course – every student must choose what’s right for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course will open with a two\nweek introduction, exploring the landscape of learning analytics in higher\neducation and setting the table for the main event. This is followed by a four\nweek meal during which participants may choose among an array of five different\ntopics, each presented at two levels: a small plate providing a quick\nintroduction, or a more filling entrée. Those choosing small plates will still have\nthe opportunity to work with realistic data, analyzing it with code we provide.\nThose choosing entrées will make creative contributions of their own: writing\nnew code for analysis or visualization of the data we provide, perhaps bringing\nin data of their own. After this month of exploration, the final two weeks will\nfeature a concluding coffee. In them, we’ll review what students learned while\nwandering through all five courses, share the best things class members\ninvented, and provide some concluding remarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]\nTry searching for “learning\nanalytics” in the Google Ngram server…nothing comes up!\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The menu:\n\nOur smörgåsbord will include five\nmajor courses, each offered in both small plate and full entrée sizes. Each\ncourse will provide both a realistic data set and a set of example R code which\ncan be used to conduct the basic analyses we will discuss. Small plate users\nwill watch a few video lectures about their topic, complete a short quiz on the\ncontent, download the data and R code, and run an analysis to answer some simple\nquestions. Users who choose the entrée will go further, extending the code in\nboth instructor-specified and student defined ways. The really ambitious will\nrepeat and extend these analyses using their own, local data. An introductory\nvideo for each course will outline what it includes and provide some sense of\nwhat users at each level will experience.\n\nTo keep the focus on the\npractical, the five courses are designed to explore analyses of interest to\ndifferent audiences: students, instructors, department leaders, campus-wide\nleaders, and course designers.\n\nLA for students: How to become the student you\nwant to be? Exploring courses, majors, comparing your performance to others\nrealistically and richly.LA for instructors: Performance prediction in a\ncourse: up to and including grade penalties, placement analyses, performance\ndisparities and their correlates, course-to-course correlationLA for department leaders: Persistence in a\nmajor, first through short course sequences and then from intention to degreeLA for college/university leaders:\nCharacterizing the student experience, program evaluation – observing\ndifferences and probing impact, capturing more and better information,\ncomparing the experience of different groups.LA for course designers: What affects\nperformance – behavior measurement, establishing the evidence basis for advice,\nthen acting to affect performance with technological and human behavior change\ntechniques, putting real-time data to work – early warning systems and\npersonalized communication\n                                    ",

This course explores a set of critical issues in the education and educational reform space, with a focus on aspects of the field that have sparked controversy and polarized views. We will dig into these debates, situating them within the larger history of public education and school reform, and considering the viewpoints, the evidence, and translation of issues into educational policy. \n \nWe will consider three broad topics in this course:\n1.  Federal Strategies in School Reform: How has the federal government legislated and incented public school reform? \n2.  School Choice: How does school choice aim to improve schools? \n3.  Accountability: What is the history of accountability in American public schooling? What are the policies and practices associated with accountability? \n\nLearning Goals\nThis course will enable participants to:\n1. develop an informed historical perspective about public schooling in the United States;\n2. understand the unique contextual elements of the American approach to public schooling;\n3. analyze and assess divergent viewpoints about American public school history and school reform policy.\n\nTeachers may be able to receive continuing education credit for successful completion of this course. To earn continuing education credits students must purchase and earn the Course Certificate, which they can then submit to the credit-issuing agency in their state.  Students should also fill out the requisite paperwork stating that the affiliated provider is the Graham School at the University of Chicago, and that average time for certificate-level course completion is 18 hours. Students outside of Illinois should contact their state’s accreditation board to determine whether this course is eligible for continuing education credit. Note that it is up to the schools or districts that employ teachers to decide whether this course meet their requirements.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        American Public Education: Critical Issues &amp; Historical ContextAs we launch the course, we will explore the history of public schooling and school reform in the United States. The approach to public education in the United States is unique, with governance, quality, and approach residing at the state and local level. As a result, efforts to improve and reform public schools in the United States are complex. Together, we will unpack these critical foundational characteristics of American public schooling, and explore the ways in which these contextual factors influence topics explored throughout the course.The No Child Left Behind ActThis week, we will examine federal strategies to improve public schooling, beginning with the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). NCLB is the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Enacted during the presidency of George W Bush, NCLB emphasized accountability, choice and flexibility. Discussion of the goals and intentions of NCLB will naturally lead us to consider the controversies around federal involvement in public education given the nature of the locally controlled approach to the American system. We will explore divergent opinions about NCLB theory of action and effectiveness.The Common Core State StandardsAs we continue our exploration of federal involvement in public education, we will discuss the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), the creation of a shared set of common standards and assessments for public education. We will examine the history of the creation of standards in the United States, revealing the fact that the concept of standards has been evident for decades. What can we learn from this history? How is the Common Core like or not like these previous efforts? We will consider the goals and intentions behind the Common Core, as well as the divergent opinions about its effectiveness.Interlude 1: Interview and Panel Discussion on NCLB and CCSSWe had the pleasure of interviewing several experts in the education space from around Chicago and the Urban Education Institute. Listen as they discuss topics surrounding NCLB and CCSS. They will have a variety of perspectives from that of a researcher to a practitioner. Which do you identify with? Did any of the participants resonate with you?Summarizing Debates around School ChoiceSchool choice includes a set of practices and policies that aim to provide new educational options for students, to improve individual, school and school system outcomes. The concept on the surface sounds simple and logical and yet school choice is complex in implementation and has sparked much debate. What are the reasons for this controversy? Together, we will examine the history, types of school choice, the debates about effectiveness, and the ways in which this theory of action has become highly politicized and controversial.Charter SchoolsThis week, we will focus our attention on charter schools. We will explore the history of charter schools in the United States, examining fundamental questions about their theory of action and effectiveness. In these lectures, we will gain critical knowledge about how charter schools came to be, whether they are effective, and why they are so controversial.Interlude 2: Interview and Panel Discussion on School Choice and Charter SchoolsWe had the pleasure of interviewing several experts in the education space from around Chicago and the Urban Education Institute. Listen as they discuss issues surrounding School Choice and Charter Schools. They will have a variety of perspectives from that of a researcher to a practitioner. Which do you identify with? Did any of the participants resonate with you?School Accountability: History, Theory of Action, PolicyThe idea of accountability, or holding students, teachers, schools and school districts responsible for school performance, has become a key focus for practitioners, policy makers, and citizens. Why did the concept of accountability emerge and why has it become so central, so controversial? This week, we will learn about the concept of accountability in schools, which emerged in the United States in the 1990s. We will examine the history of the accountability, and the many forms this idea has taken. In doing so, we will consider pressing questions about how we ensure high quality schooling while not making accountability an ends in itself. Teacher Effectiveness and EvaluationThis week, we will dig more deeply into the concept of accountability, by examining teacher effectiveness and evaluation. In the process, we will learn about efforts to define and measure teacher effectiveness, and the push nationally to integrate teacher evaluation into individual teacher, school, school system and state accountability systems.Conclusion and Final AssignmentIn the last week, we interviewed several experts in the education space from around Chicago and the Urban Education Institute on their view of accountability. As a summary of your learning in this class, we ask you to write a short response paper. \n                                    ",

Participants will gain competence and confidence in working with students by focusing on legislation, universal design, and assistive technologies.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionStudents come to our higher education classrooms with a wide variety of knowledge, skills, talents, and abilities. As educators, we want all of our students to be successful and feel supported in an inclusive learning environment. Many of our students have disabilities that they may or may not disclose to faculty and staff. Typically, the process of providing required documentation and identifying appropriate accommodations is a collaborative effort between the student and the disability services staff. Faculty are not a part of this process and may not be aware of the rationale or implications. In this week, we will begin with an introduction to students with disabilities. Week 1 highlights the key United States legislation that relates to higher education students with disabilities and describes the process of obtaining support services. Accommodations and Assistive TechnologyThis week we describe the process used for deciding on reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and the role of Disability Services in making this determination. We identify specific accommodations that students with disabilities might need in order to fully participate in life at the university.Accessible DesignIn Weeks 1 and 2, we reviewed disability definitions and legislation, plus the disability services, accommodations, and technologies that you might find on your college campus.  In Week 3, we focus on the design and development of your course materials. We use the term “universal design” to emphasize the inclusive design of instruction to make it meaningful and useful for all students. We also look at best practices for documents such as using clear fonts, organizing text with headings, and describing images with alternative text.\nApplicationPlease read the following case studies and respond to the corresponding questions on the discussion boards.\n                                    ",

You will be introduced to the concept of task and the key principles of task-based language teaching (TBLT) and learning. TBLT uses communicative tasks as the key unit for creating language learning activities. You will also examine the role of reading in real-life and in second and foreign language teaching and current thinking about the interface between TBLT and second language reading. You will explore how TBLT and teaching second language reading can be successfully integrated in practice through analysing task-based reading materials. The course culminates in creating task-based materials for teaching reading in your own language teaching contexts. \n\nAfter completing the course, you will be able to: \n1.\tExplain the main components and tenets of a task-based approach to teaching language;\n2.\tExplain the main issues involved in teaching reading;\n3.\tIllustrate connections between TBLT approaches and the teaching of reading;  \n4.\tIntegrate tasks into your own teaching; \n5.\tIdentify reading texts that are suitable for the construction of tasks; and \n6.\tConstruct reading tasks and sequences for use in your own classroom.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to the Course Welcome to 'Teaching EFL/ESL Reading: A Task Based Approach!'.What is Task-based Language Teaching (TBLT)? Welcome to module 1! In this module we will be looking at some key concepts and issues that surround the role of tasks in second language learning and teaching.  First, we will define what we mean by the notion of task. Then, we will consider different task types and the role of tasks in the syllabus. We will also discuss the rationale for using tasks in second language teaching, and how task-based lessons and sequences are typically organized. The module ends with an interview with Dr. Nick Andon from Kings' College London, who is an international expert on task-based language teaching. What is Reading and What Does It Involve?Welcome to module 2! In this module we examine reading from a number of angles. We start by examining the cognitive element of reading. The second angle we examine reading from is reading as a communicative activity, and its links with communicative language teaching. We then look at reading as a strategic activity, and at the links between reading and background knowledge, and look at the way in which background knowledge is needed in order to understand three specific texts. We end by discussing ways of developing reading fluency. Teaching Reading in the Second Language Classroom\nWelcome to module 3! In this module we will be thinking about the ways in which we teach reading in the foreign and second language classroom. We start by comparing the ways in which we read outside the classroom and the ways in which we ask our learners to reading in the classroom. We think about principles for reading in the communicative language classroom and about the implications of these principles. We go on to consider the three-phase reading lesson and look closely at an example of such a lesson, and then look at other ways in which we can construct reading lessons, focusing on the way in which we can incorporate tasks into such lessons. We end with an interview with Prof. Cathie Wallace, who talks about her research into reading classrooms. \nFocus on Language in the Reading Lesson Welcome to module 4! In this module we will be looking at how a focus on language, such as grammar and vocabulary, can be integrated into task-based reading sequences. First, we will consider some of the options available in terms of the stages of the task-based reading lesson. Next, we will look at each stage in more detail. We will discuss the usefulness of pre-teaching vocabulary. We will examine how  a focus on language can be incorporated at the while-reading stage. In particular, we will review research on two textual modification techniques, glossing and textual input enhancement. We will also reflect on ways of selecting linguistic features for language-focused work in the post-reading phase. The module ends with an interview with Dr. Parvaneh Tavakoli, a well-known researcher working on task-based language teaching. Extensive Reading Welcome to module 5! In this module we move away from the intensive teaching of reading in the classroom to working with learners on extensive reading. We define extensive reading and look at the main principles of using extensive reading. We discuss the benefits of extensive reading programmes, as well as the way in which extensive reading can be linked to task based language teaching. We end with an interview with Dr. Sam Duncan in which she talks about her experience of running a reading circle with a group of adult literacy and ESOL learners. Designing Reading Tasks Welcome to the last module on our MOOC. In this module we will focus on the way in which we can write materials: we will think about sources for texts, about finding suitable tasks for texts, and will practice write new tasks for texts that you have already read. We will end with two interviews: one with Caroline Herring, a teacher in London who talks about materials she wrote for her own learners, and the second with Prof. Pauline Foster, who talks about reading and reading tasks. \n                                    ",

Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course Introduction, First C# Program, and Storing DataLearn about the course structure, the course programming environment, and Dr. T; Learn how to write a C# program; Learn how we use data types, variables, and constants to store data in our programs; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 1Classes and Objects, MonoGame/XNA BasicsLearn some foundational Object-Oriented concepts; Learn the basics of MonoGame/XNA; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 2; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 1Strings and SelectionLearn about using C# strings; Learn how we make decisions in our code; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 3; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 2Recovery weekReflect on previous course material with no new material this week; Complete and submit Project Increment 1; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 3MonoGame/XNA Mice and Controllers, Arrays and Collection ClassesLearn how to use mice and controllers for input; Learn how to store larger amounts of data; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 4; Complete and submit Peer Review of Project Increment 1Recovery weekReflect on previous course material with no new material this week; Complete and submit Project Increment 2; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 4IterationLearn how to do things multiple times; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 5; Complete and submit Peer Review of Project Increment 2Recovery weekReflect on previous course material with no new material this week; Complete and submit Project Increment 3; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 5Class Design and ImplementationLearn how to design and implement classes; Complete and submit Programming Assignment 6; Complete and submit Peer Review of Project Increment 3Recovery WeekReflect on previous course material with no new material this week; Complete and submit Project Increment 4; Complete and submit Peer Review of Programming Assignment 6MonoGame/XNA Audio, MonoGame/XNA Text IOLearn how to play music and sound effects in MonoGame/XNA; Learn how to process keyboard input and display text in MonoGame/XNA; Complete and submit Project Increment 5; Complete and submit Peer Review of Project Increment 4The Final WeekThe description goes here\n                                    ",

We’ll also look at some core algorithms for searching for and sorting data.   And along the way, you will develop an exciting interactive application with a graphical user interface.\n\nIn this course we want you to be inspired to create.  You’ll dive into a course project right away, with each lesson designed around concepts that are directly applicable to extending the project’s functionality.  The video lectures include both core content as well as testimonials and stories from real-world software engineers, conversations between real students who are learning the material that you will likely relate to, and numerous support videos that you can turn to if you get stuck.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome and Project Overview: Visualizing DataWelcome to the first module in our course.

Let's get started!Objects, Memory Models, and ScopeWe hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are!  In this second module of the course, we’re going to briefly step away from writing project code and learn some fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. This module might be a bit of a review of material you have learned in your first Java programming course.  If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip right to module assessment, which for this module is a quiz.

If you learn well from lectures alone, then watching only these videos might work for you. The Concept Challenge videos test your learning of material you just watched.  These videos will give you practice to make sure you’re prepared for the quizzes and the programming assignments.  Most learners will find them helpful in addition to the Core video series. The Support series videos give you a little extra practice and guidance when you feel you need it.  Finally, the In the Real World, and When I Struggled video series relate the concepts and skills you are learning to real-life experiences and situations.  Play around with watching and/or skipping the different video types until you find a combination of that works best for your learning.Graphical output: Creating GUIs and Displaying DataNow that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. This is a highly interactive module, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up!  We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos.  Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course.  Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos.  We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want.  The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this module - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun!InheritanceNow that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code.  Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this module.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.    GUIs: Responding to User EventsYou’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this module you’ll add interactivity to your map!  You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm.  Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks. As always, make sure you're writing code along with us as you watch the videos and work through the module.  Also, feel free to dive into the programming assignment (project) whenever you are readySearching and Sorting: From Code to AlgorithmsYou've come a long way in this course, and you've got a great project to show for it. In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array.  Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.   We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing.Finishing UpWhat?  Another module?  Well, there's no new content to learn, but we wanted to give you a little buffer time to work on your projects and your peer review assignments and reviews.  So take this time to make sure you've got the best project you can produce, and to get some ungraded feedback from your peers on your peer review assignment.  Just make sure you're all finished up with your graded submission and your peer reviews well before the end of course deadline.  We're looking forward to seeing you in our next class!\n                                    ",

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill.\n\nOne of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding,” this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression.\n\nSo if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this free online course extremely useful.\n\nExplore the concepts and skills of creative coding\n\nThroughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write.\n\nThe aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs.\n\nEach week we’ll start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound. You’ll learn how to interact with them to change their behaviour, creating increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques.\n\nLearn with professional artists and designers\n\nWe will also look at how leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them.\n\nThe course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as:\n\n\n  Can a computer be independently creative?\n  Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program?\n  How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology?\n  Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art?\n\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.\n\n(Image © 2010 Jon McCormack)\n\n\n                                    ",

This course, *built with input from GitHub*, will introduce the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.\n\nThis course is part of the  Front End and  Full Stack Nanodegrees..Why Take This Course?Git is used by many tech companies, and a public GitHub profile serves as a great portfolio for any developer. But more than that, you’ll establish an efficient programming workflow that allows you to:\n\n* Keep track of multiple versions of a file\n* Track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file\n* Seamlessly collaborate with other developers on a project\n\nThe use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with other developers in most professional environments.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ###Lesson 1: Navigating a Commit History\nIn this lesson, you’ll learn about a few different types of version control systems and discover what makes Git a great version control system for programmers.  You’ll also get practice using Git to view the history of an existing project.  You’ll learn to see all the versions that have been saved, checkout a previous version, and compare two different versions.\n###Lesson 2: Creating and Modifying a Repository\nIn this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a repository and save versions of your project.  You’ll learn about the staging area, committing your code, branching, and merging, and how you can use these to make you more efficient and effective.\n###Lesson 3: Using GitHub to Collaborate\nIn this lesson, you’ll get practice using GitHub or other remote repositories to share your changes with others and collaborate on multi-developer projects.  You’ll learn how to make and review a pull request on GitHub.  Finally, you’ll get practice by collaborating with other Udacity students to write a create-your-own-adventure story.\n\n###Project: Contribute to a Live Project\nStudents will publish a repository containing their reflections from the course and submit a pull request to a collaborative Create-Your-Own-Adventure story.\n                                    ",

This course is for anyone with mathematical, scientific or engineering backgrounds who wishes to develop a grounding in scientific computing. Using a range of hands-on lessons, participants in the course will develop the basic skills to tackle modern computational modelling problems.\r\nIn developing this course, the instructors are inspired by the philosophy of open-source software. One of the tenets of the course is that we can use the web to interact, connect our learning, teach each other by sharing our learning objects. Therefore, this course is especially for those who are eager to participate in distributed knowledge creation on the web. Join us in this adventure!\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nThe connected courses and MOOC are aimed at first-year graduate students or advanced seniors, but assume only a background in vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. We won't assume more than a beginner's programming experience and will guide students to develop a foundation in numerical methods, and hands-on experience coding up solutions to differential equations.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The course will consist of six learning modules that are somewhat self-contained. Each one will be motivated by a problem that can be modeled by a differential equation (or system of DEs) and will build new concepts in numerical computing, new coding skills and ideas about analysis of numerical solutions.\r\nThe learning modules are roughly as follows:\r\nThe phugoid model of glider flight.\r\nDescribed by a set of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the phugoid model motivates numerical time integration methods, and we will build it starting from an even simpler model (e.g., simple harmonic motion), building up to the full nonlinear model in 4 or 5 lessons on initial-value problems. Roughly, this module would include: a) Forward/backward differencing and Euler's method for simple harmonic motion; b) extension to the phugoid model; c) the midpoint method, convergence testing, local vs. global error; d) Runge-Kutta methods.\r\nSpace and Time—Introduction to finite-difference solutions of PDEs\r\nStarting with the simplest model represented by a partial differential equation (PDE)—the linear convection equation in one dimension—, this module builds the foundation of using finite differencing in PDEs. (The module is based on the “CFD Python” collection, steps 1 through 4.) It also motivates CFL condition, numerical diffusion, accuracy of finite-difference approximations via Taylor series, consistency and stability, and the physical idea of conservation laws.\r\nRiding the wave: convection problems.\r\nStarting with the inviscid Burgers’ equation in conservation form and a 1D shock wave, cover a sampling of finite-difference convection schemes of various types: upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff, MacCormack, then MUSCL (discussing limiters). Traffic-flow equation with MUSCL (from HyperPython). Reinforce concepts of numerical diffusion and stability, in the context of solutions with shocks. It will motivate spectral analysis of schemes, dispersion errors, Gibbs phenomenon, conservative schemes.\r\nSpreading out: diffusion problems\r\nStart with heat equation in 2D (first introduction of two-dimensional FD discretization). Introduce implicit methods: backward Euler, trapezoidal rule (Crank-Nicolson), backward-differentiation formula (BDF). Pattern formation models (reaction-diffusion). Theory content: A-stability (unconditional stability), L-stability. Fourier spectral methods and splitting.\r\nRelax and hold steady: elliptic problems.\r\nLaplace and Poisson equations (steps 9 and 10 of “CFD Python”), explained as systems relaxing under the influence of the boundary conditions and the Laplace operator; introducing the idea of pseudo-time and iterative methods. Linear solvers for PDEs : Jacobi’s method, slow convergence of low-frequency modes (matrix analysis of Jacobi), Jacobi as a smoother, Multigrid.\r\nBoundaries take over: the boundary element method (BEM)\r\nWeak and boundary integral formulation of elliptic partial differential equations; the free space Green's function. Boundary discretization: basis functions; collocation and Galerkin systems. The BEM stiffness matrix: dense versus sparse; matrix conditioning. Solving the BEM system: singular and near-singular integrals; Gauss quadrature integration.\n                                    ",

Learn how to  create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies.\n\nDeveloping international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code.\n\nIn this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later; but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand.\n\nIn this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process. The course has three discrete sections: business considerations, design, and development.\n\nNo previous programming knowledge is necessary for Part 1. Parts 2 and 3 require an understanding of basic coding techniques.\n\n                                    ",

Dijkstra*\n\nDebugging is yin to programming's yang; you can't have one without the other. However, finding bugs in programs can be an incredibly frustrating and demotivating process for developers. This course will teach you a variety of techniques to help make debugging your code easier.Why Take This Course?Debugging is one of the most fundamental processes involved in writing software. Nobody writes perfect code, and job-ready developers should know how to find and fix programming errors.\n\nIn this course, you'll learn standard methodologies for debugging software—especially for iOS applications. Additionally, you'll learn how to use Xcode’s debugging tools (breakpoints, LLDB, etc.) to squash those bugs!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ###Lesson 1A: Debugging, Printing, Logging\nIn this lesson, you'll be introduced to the \"So Many Bugs\" app, which we'll use to solve coding mysteries throughout the course. You'll also learn about the debugging process, and how to use print statements to identify bugs.\n\n###Lesson 1B: Stepping Through Code\nIn this lesson, you'll learn how to use breakpoints to examine application state at any point during execution.\n\n###Lesson 2A: LLDB and Breakpoint Actions\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about LLDB (low-level debugger)—the debugging super tool. You'll be introduced to common LLDB commands, tips, and tricks.\n\n###Lesson 2B: Breakpoints and Visual Tools\nIn this lesson, you'll learn about exception and symbolic breakpoints, and how to debug your code using Xcode's visual debugging tools.\n                                    ",

As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables, arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated development environment.\n\nThis course is comprised of two 5-week parts.\n\nPart 1 introduces programming fundamentals.\n\nProblem solving\n\tPrimitive data types and arithmetic expressions\n\tObject-oriented programming basics\n\tBranching and Loops\n\tArrays\nPart 2 covers the following topics.\n\nString manipulation\n\tFile I/O\n\tSimple event-driven programming\n\tRecursion\n\tAbstract data types\nFAQ\n\nWhat software will be required for this course?\n\nWe will use Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) to give the computer the capability to run java programs and use BlueJ as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java programs.\n\nWhich version of Java will be used in this course?\n\nThe course is based on Java Version 7. It is fine that if you would like to use Java Version 8, but the new features introduced in Version 8 will not be covered by this course.\n\nWhat are the system requirements for MS Windows users?\n\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by MS Windows XP or above (except Windows RT). Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Internet Explorer 8+ or Firefox 3.6+ or Google Chrome to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\n\nWhat are the system requirements for Mac users?\n\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or above. Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Safari 5.1.3+ or Firefox 3.6+ (64-bit) to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Google Chrome is not supported. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\n\nWhat are the system requirements for Linux users?\n\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Ubuntu/Debian Linux. OpenJDK, an implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK), will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Firefox 3.6+ to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\n\nCan I use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) other than BlueJ?\n\nIn this course, we would recommend BlueJ to beginning programmers as it is compact and provides just enough features for learning programming. Most of the programming examples in this course assume using BlueJ. However, you may use other professional IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans according to your own preference.\n\nWill I be required to view Java Applets for learning the course materials?\n\nThere will be some demonstration programs shown as Java Applets in this course. However, these applets will only act as supplementary materials. Inaccessible to the applets would not affect the learning of the course materials. To access the applets, you will have to enable or activate Java plug-in on the browser. The plug-in requires 32-bit version of Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) on MS Windows, 64-bit version of JRE on Mac OS X or 32/64-bit version of OpenJDK on Linux depending on the architecture of the system.\n\n                                    ",

The lessons and examples provided are delivered in a step-by-step, detailed way to ensure mastery of the skills and topics covered.\r\nCourse Outline\r\nIntroduction walks through the course goals, approach and then define Maven.\r\nAfter just a little bit of Theory in Core Concepts, we step through Maven Installation on Windows and Mac OS X.\r\nIn Setup and Getting Help, we cover how to ask for help in Maven. We also download the course working files on GitHub.\r\nAfter the setup and installation of Maven, we get hands-on in Getting Started as we create our first Maven project -- keeping it simple with a minimal demo. Maven Basics covers additional concepts. The concepts are continued in Beyond the Basics as we look into dependencies, repositories and plugins within Maven. Then we improve our project by Unit Testing -- where we add JUnit tests, deal with (and avoid) testing failures. Finally, the last section of the main part of this course is dedicated to running Maven within Eclipse using the M2Eclipse plugin.\r\nDuring the entire course, we get into a habit of saving our changes periodically using Git source control.\r\nFinally, the Bonus section provides some extra lessons to compliment the course and add value. These lesson are non-critical and thus don't belong in the main part of the course.\r\nCourse Features\r\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum (about 20 minutes).\r\nOver 2 hours of Screencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated.\r\nAt the end of each section containing command line interaction, Command Listing lectures that serve as reference and reminder of the commands used in the previous lecture(s).

In order to ikeep the course short and to-the-point, several decisions were made in order to provide a complete path from CI to CD.\r\nThe pipeline created in this course consists of the following:\r\n\r\nJenkins CI server installed and configured on Windows\r\nGit as the source control system\r\nJava as the main programming language of build projects\r\nMaven as the build tool\r\nFindbugs, PMD, and Checkstyle as the static code analysis tools\r\nTomcat as the deployment server\r\n\r\nThis set of tools provides a comprehensive, end-to-end implementation continuous deployment pipeline. Jenkins can be installed on many operating systems and supports a myriad of tools and technologies -- which means, this course provides tremendous value to those comfortable or interested in other operating systems and/or technologies.\r\nCourse Outline\r\nIntroduction provides an overview for the course, which leas to the Core Concepts for Jenkins. This provides a foundation for the remainder of the course.\r\nInstallation provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Jenkins and all the related tools specifically on Windows. The same principles are applicable to other operating systems as well.\r\nThe Basics provides a first look at Jenkins at work with a very simple \"freestyle\" project. This allows us to learn the Jenkins interface and the key features it provides.\r\nAfter that, we dive into Maven Projects specifically -- since Jenkins natively understand Maven and thus provides special features for Maven projects.\r\nJenkins can do so much more than simply building. In Test &amp; Quality, we hook up a standard set of unit testing and quality analysis tools for Java projects. Then, we use that information to affect the build status based on established standards.\r\nWe also cover how to use Jenkins as an artifact repository which is used to store the build artifacts, like jars and wars, after successful builds. This is particularly useful when integrating Jenkins with other tools in a more comprehensive software delivery strategy.\r\nThen, we bring everything together for Deployment to a running Tomcat server. Don't worry, I'll walk you through the complete setup and configuration to work seamlessly with Jenkins!\r\nFinally, no course would be complete without talking about Security. In this final chapter, we setup Jenkins to allow users to login and only see their projects.\r\nCourse Features\r\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas in each major area or introduction of new concepts.\r\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There are several hours of screencat video content -- it makes up the vast majority of the course. Any command line based screencast will include a command listing in the lecture downloads.\n\n                                    ",

We start off by signing up for GitHub, creating a repository there, the makiing a local copy (clone), local changes (add/commit) and then update GitHub with our changes (push).\r\nIn Basic Commands, we walk through all the foundational commands needed to start a new project managed by Git (or enable Git for an existing project) all the way through making commits, including common file operations like moving and deleting files. We also cover how to exclude the wrong files from accidentally being committed and how to review your repository's history.\r\nWith a strong foundation in place, we explore ways to make Comparisons in Git, including all the different local states, between commits, and between local and remote repositories.\r\nWe give great attending to Branching and Merging in Git. We start off with the simple \"happy path\" and learn about \"Fast-Forward\" merges and how to control them. The we walk through common \"automatic\" merges. Finally, we cause trouble on purpose so we can step through resolving conflicting merges with our visual merge tool.\r\nWith a strong foundation in branching and merging, we will then cover a more complex topic,Rebasing. In that section, we cover several rebasing examples, including how to resolve a rebase conflict.\r\nIn the Stashing section, we save our work-in-progress while we attend to more pressing issues, then pick up where we left off after that.\r\nNEW: In the Tagging section, we mark important milestones or releases within our project. We also use those tags later for comparing differences between important milestones. We also look at how to use tags within GitHub.\r\nAll tools have installation and configuration sections to ensure no one is left behind.\r\nCourse Features\r\nPresentations provide audio/video training of conceptual ideas. Since few like slide-ware presentations, slide-presentations are kept to a minimum.\r\nScreencasts provide a video of the instructor's computer system with any actions, commands, or screens displayed and narrated. There is nearly 4 hours of screencast based video training in order to step through each command or action in sufficient detail.\r\nSeveral attachments and document lectures throughout the course provide supplemental information, illustrations, or other reference material.\r\nMoving Forward\r\nThis course will expand periodically to include more topics, supporting materials and bonus content! Some content may be in direct response to student feedback or discussions -- so get engaged with the course discussions feature!\n\n                                    ",

SAP HANA extended application services in SPS 11 represents an evolution of the application server architecture; building upon the previous strengths while expanding the technical scope. This one-week nutshell course will offer an overview of the new architecture and the various expanded capabilities it makes possible.\r\nAll of the architectural changes described in this course can be summarized in one key point: choice. SAP HANA SPS 11 offers customers and partners the freedom of choice of technologies, tools, and deployment options for high-scale development and operation of native SAP HANA applications.\r\nIt is also easier to choose between on-premise and cloud deployment. Because of the shared architecture being delivered going forward, it will soon be easy to develop an application that can be deployed on premise, in the cloud, or both without any coding changes.\r\nIn this course, we will assume that you have baseline knowledge of SAP HANA development and will instead focus on new and improved features which were introduced in SAP HANA SPS 11. Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nUnit 1: Introduction to SAP HANA XS Advanced\r\nUnit 2: Node.js\r\nUnit 3: SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure\r\nUnit 4: Security and User Management\r\nUnit 5: Tooling\r\nUnit 6: Closing\r\n\n                                    ",

Max allows most computer users to write a simple, meaningful program within a few minutes, even with limited programming knowledge. But to do something more substantial it's necessary to approach Max as an actual programming language, by taking advantage of its various mechanisms for abstracting program elements into scalable, reusable components that can be combined in increasingly powerful ways.This class will not cover every single capability of the language, but instead will focus on key concepts and mechanisms that will allow for tremendous new freedom and possibilities in Max. The class will touch upon:sound and movie playbacksound synthesissound and video effects processingalgorithmic compositioncross-modal mappings (e.g., video affecting audio and vice versa)interactive control (e.g., from QWERTY keyboard, mouse, USB devices, Open Sound Control)Max programming, like most interesting topics, has deep aspects and shallow aspects. This course will largely focus on the deep aspects: principles, concepts, techniques, and theory. If you understand these underlying aspects, your capacity to create in Max will deepen exponentially.At the same time, this is not just a theory class. You will also create your own projects using Max. This course will teach the minimum you need to start working on assignments, but mostly I will teach you how to learn or look up the shallow knowledge on your own using Max’s built-in documentation, the Internet, and the Kadenze course forum, as well as how to program your own tests that answer specific questions or reveal potential bugs. Working in this way, you will also develop essential skills and habits that will develop confidence and self-sufficiency, and serve you in the future.\n\n                                    ",

It is a \"literacy\" course designed to introduce you to the various core components that make the web such a powerful platform for art – art that is not only visual, but sonic, physical, interactive, and social. It will give you the basics (in terms of knowledge and code templates) to make things that run in browsers using:• Animation with graphics and sound,• Interaction with graphics and sound,Just as you don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car, you do not need to wait until you are an expert programmer before creating work for the web.There is a vast array of tools for making things for the web. Making things for the web is a process of constant learning and discovery – not one of knowing everything first and then making. It is also a process of ripping and mashing rather than writing everything from scratch. Getting comfortable with this process is the first step, and is the approach we take in this introductory course.By the end of this course, you will be making things with the real-world core components that give the web its potential for art, but you will have only just begun. More importantly, you will understand what you have to learn more about to accomplish your artistic objectives, be able to recognize things and be able to evaluate their value to you, and have a command of the terminology you need to search for and discuss your needs and interests with the huge community of people on the net with experience (and code chunks) to share.Why JavaScript and the Web?There are some excellent special-purpose coding platforms for artists out there such as Processing for interactive graphics, Chuck or supercollider for synthesis, graphical languages such as Max/MSP or PD for interactive sound and graphics. These platforms have extensive communities of people to share experience and code with. However, these special-purpose platforms are not standard web building and design tools.What they offer is a direct path to achieving a specific artistic objective, but it is at the expense of a more general applicability of language, tools, and skills that would allow you to interact with people in the web-based creative industries.  They do a great job at \"hiding\" things you may not want to worry about as an artist, but dealing with a bit of the scaffolding is necessary if the web is the space you have chosen to embark on for developing your work.This course will take you through the basics you need to develop artistic content for the web using standard web tools – JavaScript, html, and several fundamental libraries.  It will point you to exactly what concerns an artist most – making creative content. It will guide you and teach you what you can ignore for now in order to focus on artistic content, but will not prevent you from integrating with the vast world of the web and learning and using some of the scaffolding if and when you should need it later.Our basic approach to achieving this goal is to \"throw you in to the deep end\" with a set of code templates for meeting artistic goals – interactive graphical mobile applications using physical sensors, for example,  and explaining simple things you can do immediately to explore and  implement your own ideas.The advantages to JavaScript:• It is the language embedded in all browsers today.• It is general purpose, and makes no assumptions that limit your artistic objectives.• You can deploy all your work on the web for others to experience.• You only need to learn one language for writing both client and server code.• A *lot* of other people use it that you can share and communicate with.• It is a marketable skill.Thus, we are not restricting you to special-purpose tools that don't generalize well to the web – but that doesn't mean you will have to write a bunch of code not related to your artistic vision.  The \"template\" technique used in this course is a \"middle way\" that gets you up and going fast, but provides a path to future growth and connection to the real world.You will learn to recognize patterns of code that you need not know how to write. This will provide you with a basic understanding of how things work in the real world (let's call it literacy). This will help you find, recognize, and use chunks of code that others share, and it will allow you to focus on code directly relevant to artistic content.This will give you the foundations you need to go on learning on your own by exploring the unstructured wealth of material available out there on the web to pillage and modify for your own work. That is how real web programmers work all the time, anyway!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Intro To The Web Landscape This session will cover set up, HTML &amp; CSS, how to structure a document, as well as help and support resources.\r\nSession 2: JavaScript Basics This session will introduce operators, variables, strings, objects, and functions; course template directory and file structures, how to use console.log, communicating with the DOM, and interaction.\r\nSession 3: Graphics This session will cover how to use libraries, shapes and colors, animation, timers and callbacks, interaction, and audio.\r\nSession 4: Servers And Clients (Node.Js) In this session we will discuss servers, clients, networks, serving a web page using node.js, more interaction, and JavaScript basics II.\r\nSession 5: Client Communication This session will cover clients and servers, ports and sockets, non-blocking code and callbacks, chat room.\r\nSession 6: Sensors This session will cover pitch, roll, yaw and putting it all together.\n                                    ",

Quizzes (5) 30%Assignments (4) 40%Project (1) 30 %Quizzes After watching each video lecture series, you will take a multiple choice quiz which will count towards your final grade. You can only take these quizzes ONCE. We are using this MOOC to flip the classroom and we do not give our students multiple chances.  There are also “in-video questions,” and you must answer these questions correctly in order to advance the video, but these questions are NOT graded, you can re-do the “in-video” quiz as many times as you need to.AssignmentsAssignments are purely technical; each module will include a detailed explanation of how to complete and grade each assignment. There will be one assignment (which may have multiple components)  every week that there is no project due.  Each assignment should take you no more than one hour.ProjectThe final project is both aesthetic and technical; there will be an explanation of how to grade the project but you must remember that art is subjective. You can expect the project to take at  least 4 hours to complete.

In this module, you will be learning some basic principles that you will need for effective planning. You will start this module off with an introduction to planning. You will then learn about how planning, and the approach you take to planning, can reduce uncertainty in your project. We will then move onto learning how to breakdown a project into small, manageable pieces, and how to organize those pieces. Finally, we will go over the differences between estimates, targets, and commitments. Together, these lessons will build a good base for learning planning techniques at both the release and iteration level. \nModule 2: Project PlanningWelcome to module 2! Now that you’ve gotten your feet wet with general principles in project planning, let’s talk about some specific ways that you can use to implement those techniques. We’ll first discuss the concepts of story points and velocity, then move into how time boxing can be used to improve your project efficiency. We’ll then introduce the Gantt chart, a basic tried and true method of visualizing project tasks. We’ll finish off with techniques for planning your project at a release level, which will set the stage for iteration planning in the next module.\nModule 3: Iteration PlanningThis module will be focusing on planning techniques at the iteration or sprint level. You will start by looking at various techniques for estimating task time. You will then look at task dependencies in more detail. This will come in handy when you learn two visual planning charts--the Critical Path Method chart, and the PERT chart. Finally, you will learn the process for creating an iteration plan. By the end of this module, you will have the tools you need to plan sprints or iterations for development. Module 4: Risk PlanningYou’ve made it to the last module, congratulations! Here, we’re going to talk about what can cause projects to fail. We’ll start off by discussing common causes of failures, including anti-patterns. Then, you’ll learn how to assess risks, looking at their likelihood and potential impact on the project. We’ll end on an optimistic note by leaving you with strategies for intervening when risks present themselves and avoiding those risks to begin with.\n\n                                    ",

In this module, you will become familiar with software requirements and some issues surrounding them. You will learn what a software requirement is, including the different types of requirements. Then, you will learn how to deal with changing requirements and control project scope, as well as how requirements affect design. These lessons will give you the knowledge you need to move on to eliciting and creating good quality requirements in the next modules.\nModule 2: User InteractionA major duty of a software product manager is eliciting and expressing requirements from your client. This module will walk you through the basics of client interactions and requirements elicitation and expression. You will learn how to create the best product for your end users, how to conduct productive  client meetings, and various ways of expressing requirements. These techniques will provide you with the tools you will need to confidently interact with your client as well as satisfy them with the “right product”. Module 3: Writing RequirementsExplore the many ways in which software requirements can be represented. In this module, you will learn about the most popular means of expressing requirements in the industry today: the user story. You will learn how acceptance tests help to verify the stories which they accompany, and how to create a robust product backlog. At the end of the module, you will learn how story maps are used to organize user stories, so that you’re always putting your effort into the tasks which makes the most impact.\nModule 4: Quality RequirementsTo this point, you have learned how to effectively elicit, express, and prioritize requirements. It’s now time to ensure clarity. This last module will explore the activity of analyzing requirements in greater detail. Analyzing creates clear, actionable, requirements which result in high quality software with fewer errors. \n                                    ",

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.\n\nFunctional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.\n\nThis course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.\n\nOnce you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.\n\nLICENSEThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ",

It also covers the foundations of core Agile practices, such as Extreme Programming and Scrum.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\n- Distinguish between different process models for organizing software production.\n- Gauge the applicability of process models for a software development project.\n- Apply the fundamentals of Agile software development and management practices.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introduction to ProcessesAre you someone who likes to see the big-picture? Being a forward thinker who knows what’s coming next is an invaluable trait as a software product manager. This module will prepare you to become this asset for your team. A software process organizes development from beginning to end. We are going to walk through each step of the development process. This will allow you to become familiar with the entire development process so that you can effectively organize product development and foresee upcoming steps--even if you’ve never worked in software development before!Module 2: Process ModelsReady to dive a little deeper? This module will familiarize you with a wide variety of software process models from throughout history. You will learn about basic software process models, like the Waterfall model and The Unified Process. These fundamental processes will set the stage for the knowledge you will gain later in the course, where more complex processes will be introduced.Module 3: Agile PracticesDo you want to help developers reach their full potential? Do you want to impress clients by delivering a great product on-schedule and on-budget?  Then this module is the place for you! In this module, you will learn some Agile methodologies that are practiced in the industry today. This module will cover the Scrum and Extreme Programming methodologies. The practices in these methodologies are some of the most popular practices in the industry today. They provide practices that will help to maintain organized and effective development. These methodologies will help you to know the exact state of your product and deliver successfully!Module 4: Other PracticesAlmost there! In this last module, we will dive into Lean Software Development and Kanban. Being the most complex tools which we will cover in this course makes them the “spike-driving machines” from our railroad-building analogy. Lean and Kanban are a cumulation of many lessons learned, and are widely used in some form in the industry today. \n                                    ",

You will discover the powerful mechanisms that are offered to build and manipulate complex data structures in a clean and efficient way. And you will see how functions play a central role, as first-class values that can be freely used in any place where an expression can appear.The OCaml programming language is a member of the ML language family pioneered by Robin Milner. An important feature of OCaml is that it reconciles the conciseness and flexibility of untyped programming languages (like Python, for example) with the safety of strongly typed programming languages (like Java, for example). The OCaml compiler performs in fact a type inference: types of identifiers do not have to be declared but are inferred by the compiler at the moment of definition of an identifier, and then used for assuring type correctness when using an identifier.We will start by using OCaml as a purely functional programming language. At the end of this MOOC we will see that OCaml is in fact a multi-paradigm language which allows you to combine the functional programming style with the imperative programming paradigm.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 0: Introduction and overviewWeek 1: Basic types, definitions and functionsWeek 2: Basic data structuresWeek 3: More advanced data structuresWeek 4: Higher order functionsWeek 5: Exceptions, input/output and imperative constructsWeek 6: Modules and data abstraction\n                                    ",

It focuses on metrics and reviews to track and improve project progress and software quality.\n \nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\n - Apply techniques to measure and visualize project progress\n - Integrate Agile review practices to increase project visibility\n - Reflect on lessons learned in software projects through retrospective exercises\n - Improve project and process quality through ongoing measurement\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Right ProductWelcome to the first module! This module is all about creating the “right product”. You will examine various ways of ensuring that you are creating the right product for both your client and your users. You will learn how to conduct a sprint review meeting and why they are an important step for delivering the right product. Then you will look at user studies. You will learn about several techniques for determining the needs of your users. The module concludes by examining how some of the big companies in the industry ensure that they are delivering the right product to their users. \nModule 2: Done RightWelcome to the second module! Now that you’ve learned about how to make sure you’re creating the “right product”, it’s time to explore how to ensure that product is “done right”. Here, you’ll start with review techniques, some issues surrounding project monitoring in general, and the Goal Quality Metric framework. Then, you’ll move on to desirable properties of metrics and dive into some key metrics for ensuring that you’re on track. You’ll finish off the module with defect analysis, leading you into getting your product “managed right” in the next module.\nModule 3: Managed RightThis third module examines the concept of managing your project right. You will learn some important and popular project management techniques. The module starts off by introducing you to the Daily Scrum meeting. You will learn ways to implement daily scrums with the teams that you work with as well as techniques to improve the meetings if they are not working well. Then we will cover the concept of Velocity in more detail which will prepare you for learning about burndown charts. This module covers both Release Burndowns, as well as Iteration Burndowns. We show you how to create, read, and use these useful tracking tools with the teams you work with. Together, these lessons will teach you how to ensure your projects are “managed right”.\nModule 4: Project RetrospectivesWelcome to the final module of the course! The previous module was focused on ensuring your project was managed right by exploring techniques in project planning. This module will focus on an often-neglected, but very valuable tool: Retrospectives. You’ll explore what retrospectives are and some issues surrounding them. Then, you’ll learn about how a retrospective looks, along with some recommended retrospective exercises. Finally, you’ll round the module off with a summary of the course!\n\n                                    ",

F# is about getting things done. The language has been attractive to groups working in finance and math-intensive disciplines but it broadens the ability of any developer to correctly express more powerful programming ideas in a safer way. So regardless of your programming background, learning F# can help make you a more effective programmer.\n\nThe first part of this course provides the groundwork and fundamentals necessary to build functional applications. It will provide a framework of functional programming concepts by giving the student clear examples and the opportunity to practice writing code using those concepts. The course will also provide you with the basics of F# syntax and the core features of the language.\n\nThe second part of this course will dive deeper into the more advanced concepts of F# such as concurrency, integration with other languages, type providers, and agents. By the end of this two-part course you will have a solid foundation in functional programming with F#.\n\nTo be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Knowing the basics of program flow, conditionals, and loops will provide a good foundation for the concepts taught in this course. There are a number of excellent resources available on edX and Microsoft Virtual Academy to help you pick up those skills before jumping in.\n\nWe look forward to spending the next few weeks with you helping you explore and understand F#.\n\n                                    ",

Il vise à faire réaliser quelques programmes simples utilisant les instructions de base (if, boucles, tableaux). A travers cette réalisation, le but est de faire comprendre ce qu'est un programme applicatif et par quel processus il est créé. Il s'agit de comprendre ce qui se passe quand on clique sur une icône.\r\nLe cours utilise le langage Java mais sans introduire les concepts de la programmation objet. Il se concentre sur des instructions de base existant sous une forme voisine dans tous les langages courants.\r\nLe cours a une durée de six semaines, chaque semaine étant subdivisée en six séquences d'une dizaine de minutes. Des évaluations intermédiaires sous forme de QCM non notés sont proposées après chaque séquence. Les évaluations notées consistent en un petit programme à écrire par semaine, celui de la dernière semaine comptant davantage. Ces évaluations notées permettent d'obtenir une attestation de suivi avec succès.\r\nUn forum est dédié aux échanges entre apprenants, aux témoignages et aux questions. Le professeur répond régulièrement par web conférence ou annonce sur la plateforme, aux principales interrogations qui ont émergé des discussions du forum.\r\nPlusieurs espaces dédiés à ce Mooc sont accessibles sur les réseaux sociaux. La communauté des inscrits et futurs inscrits peut d'ores et déjà s'y retrouver, partager des centres d'intérêts, échanger des informations, dialoguer et glaner quelques précisions sur le contenu du cours à venir.

Recent advances in hardware and software have focussed application\ndevelopment on the Web and for mobile devices such as smart phones.

This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus is on the key representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, these designs, as they move from logic to layout.   Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures.

The Simplex algorithm to solve linear programs is widely regarded as one among the \"top ten\" algorithms of the 20th century. Linear Programs arise in almost all fields of engineering including operations research, statistics, machine learning, control system design, scheduling, formal verification and computer vision. It forms the basis for numerous approaches to solving hard combinatorial optimization problems through randomization and approximation.The primary goals of this course will be to:1. Understand the basic theory behind LP, algorithms to solve LPs, and the basics of (mixed) integer programs (ILP).2. Understand important and emerging applications of LP and ILPs to economic problems (optimal resource allocation, scheduling problems), machine learning (SVM), and combinatorial optimization problems.At the end of the course, the successful student will be able to cast various problems that may arise in her research as optimization problems, understand the cases where the optimization problem will be linear, choose appropriate solution methods and interpret results appropriately.

This means that being able to design programs\n    - or at least be able to work with people who design programs - is becoming\n    a more and more valuable skill.\nTo build your own programs you need to know two things: how to use the\n    specific programming language and libraries needed, and the more general\n    skill of how to design a program.\nThis course presents a design method that will enable you to approach\n    the design of complex programs systematically. The method will work for\n    programs in this course as well as hard to design programs you develop\n    in the future.\nUsing this method you will learn how to model the information in a problem\n    domain, how to structure program data to mirror that information and how\n    to further structure the data to lead to a well organized program. You\n    will also learn to distinguish those parts of a program that are naturally\n    data driven, from those that should use an alternative algorithmic approach.\n    The method uses unit-tests to both produce a better developed design, and\n    to test your program as you develop it.\nIn the first course -- Part 1 -- we use a simple\n    teaching language to cover the core of the design method. In Part 1 we cover various forms of data; simple interactive programs like games and animations; storing information in and rendering trees; and finally exploring search programs: programs that solve puzzles like Sudoku boards. A second phase of the course, to be offered later,  will consist of parallel tracks, with each track using a different popular\n    programming language and focusing on a different kind of problem. This\n    will help you bring the design method to whatever language and problem\n    domain interests you.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nWeek One: Introduction and the structure of the course.

The topics in this course are timely since the advent of multi-core and distributed-core processors--coupled with ubiquitous wireless and wireline connectivity--is increasing the demand for researchers and practitioners who understand how to successfully develop and deploy concurrent and networked software.Despite continuous improvements in processors and networks during the past four decades, however, developing quality concurrent and networked software remains hard; developing quality reusable concurrent and networked software is even harder. The principles, methods, and skills required to develop such software can be greatly enhanced by understanding how to create and apply patterns and frameworks. A pattern describes a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a particular context. When related patterns are woven together they form a pattern language that provides a vocabulary and a process for the orderly resolution of software development problems. A framework is an integrated set of software components that collaborate to provide a reusable architecture for a family of related applications. Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete realizations of pattern languages that facilitate direct reuse of design and code.This course describes how to apply patterns and frameworks to alleviate many accidental and inherent complexities associated with developing and deploying concurrent and networked software. These patterns and frameworks have been used successfully in many domains, including telecom/datacom, mobile devices, electronic medical imaging, network management, aerospace, avionics, automation, online gaming, and financial systems. Over the coming weeks and months I'll illustrate by example how patterns and frameworks simplify and enhance the development of concurrent and networked software via the use of:Object-oriented design concepts and notations -- such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, extensibility, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).Object-oriented programming language features -- such as classes, inheritance, dynamic binding, and parameterized types available in languages like Java, C++, and C#.Middleware -- which is infrastructure software residing between applications and the underlying operating systems, networks, and hardware that encapsulates heterogeneity and enables control over key end-to-end quality-of-service properties, such as dependability and security.Operating system mechanisms -- such as event demultiplexing, multi-threading, multi-processing, and dynamic linking.We'll explore several case studies from the domains of mobile apps, web servers, object request brokers, avionic control systems, and expression tree processing to showcase a time-tested pattern-oriented software design and programming method for concurrent and networked software.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The course is organized as follows:Section 0: Overview of all the topics covered in the course. This material is designed to help you visualize the motivations for--and challenges of--of concurrent and networked software. We also summarize how patterns and frameworks help address key challenges of concurrent and networked software.Section 1: Introduction to concurrency and networking, which provides background info pertaining largely to the OS and middleware layers. We discuss key design dimensions of concurrent and networked software, as well as review common operating system programming mechanisms and Android programming mechanisms. This part focuses on concepts and is generally independent of programming language.Section 2: Overview of patterns and frameworks, which focuses on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked software. We explore key pattern and framework concepts, relationships, and examples, as well as evaluate the pros and cons of patterns and frameworks. Small code examples are shown throughout using C++ and Java, though this section concentrates more on design rather than programming.Section 3: Applying patterns and frameworks to develop concurrent and networked software, which examines lots of code. An open-source web server is used as a running example to illustrate patterns and frameworks pertaining to service access, communication, synchronous event handling, connection establishment, service initialization, service configuration and activation, concurrency and synchronization, and asynchronous event handling.

Evaluates the limitations with algorithm design and shows how pattern-oriented design alleviates these limtations.

It's this commitment to experimenting that's at the heart of today’s most successful implementations of agile. This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept testing, usability testing, functional testing, and continuous deployment. \n\nBasically, we’ll show you how to use experiments to answer these three big questions: \n     Should we build it? (And then: Did it matter?)\n     Is it usable?\n     Did it break?\n\nWe'll show you how to: \n- Translate your product’s strategic direction into a user-centric charter with lots of small, testable ideas\n- Test user motivation to make sure you’re building something that matters\n- Design and conduct usability testing (even without working software)\n- Use narrative collaboration to focus your testing \n- Integrate functional testing into a more continuous release flow\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business. The Batten Institute’s mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation: www.batteninstitute.org.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Should we build it? Did it matter?Ultimately, agile’s backbone is the substitution of observable results over the false certainty of elaborate plans. You’ve learned to avoid waste by validating problems/needs and user motivation before investing in software. Putting that testing into practice takes skill and the right kind of project charter--one that allows you to break the work into small(ish), testable ideas. In this module you’ll learn how to put that into practice by making concept testing an integral part of your culture of experimentation. You’ll go deeper on the Lean Startup techniques you’ve learned to test motivation. We’ll look at how to design and run situation-appropriate experiments, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of some working software)Is it usable?The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a ‘big unveil’. In this module, we’ll look at how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing as a standard practice. Anyone can learn to use the test plan template, prototyping tool, and supporting methods you’ll learn here. And that’s a very good thing! Very often products are released with poor usability because there ‘wasn’t enough time’ to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation.Does it break?The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related DevOps movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Large firms like Facebook now release new code twice a day. How do they do it? In this module, we’ll look at the whole continuous delivery pipeline and step through what successful practitioners do at each stage and how you can diagnose and apply the practices that will improve your implementation of agile. Most of these practices build on concepts we’ve covered and we’ll pay special attention to those linkages.Your Continuous DeliveryYou've learned about the continuous delivery pipeline and how to improve cycle time. In this module, you'll apply that learning to improve your own processes.\n                                    ",

It asks two primary questions:\n\nWhat is the potential of software within the visual arts?\nAs a designer or artist, why would I want (or need) to write software?\n\nSoftware influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Many established artists have integrated software into their process. Prominent architects and designers not only use software, they commission custom software to help them realize their unique ideas. The creators of every innovative video game and Hollywood animated film write custom software to enhance their work.\n\nAs a comprehensive first introduction to the potential of software development within a broad range of the arts, this course aspires to teach you to engage the computer more directly with code. Programming opens the possibility to create not only tools, but systems, environments, and new modes of expression. It is here that the computer ceases to be a tool and becomes a medium.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Hello In this session, we will cover the following topics: 1) What is Code? 2) Form and Computers 3) Drawing: Define and draw simple shapes; and 4) Color: Change the fill and stroke for shapes.\r\nSession 2: Variables And Loops This session will cover variables and how to store, modify, and reuse data; loops, and how to use Random to get random values from the computer.\r\nSession 3: Flow And Response In this session, we will cover the following topics: 1) Setup and Draw: Creating programs that run over time. 2) Input, Responding to the mouse and keyboard. 3) Drawing. 4) Make different tools with code. 5) Conditionals, Making decisions in code. 6) Easing.\r\nSession 4: Media: Load And Display Images, Shapes, And Fonts This session will cover external media, file formats, how to load and display images, how to load and display vector shapes, how to load fonts and display text, and how to handle sound files.\r\nSession 5: Synthesis A, Nonlinear Narrative In this session we will begin putting the elements together.

We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”.   This course is equivalent to the first half of the 11-week \"Programming for Everybody (Python)\" course.  Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter One - Why we Program?These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write programs.  We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials.  This section should not take you an entire week. Installing and Using PythonIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)In the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book.   Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it.   This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in.  You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.Chapter Two: Variables and ExpressionsIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.Chapter Three: Conditional CodeIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.  It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".Chapter Four: FunctionsThis is a relatively short chapter.   We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them.   The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.Chapter Five: Loops and IterationLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.  Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over.   Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.\n                                    ",

We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”.  This course is equivalent to the second half of the 11-week \"Programming for Everybody (Python)\" course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter Six: StringsIn this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures.   The second week of this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the applications on your desktop or laptop.  If you choose not to install Python, you can just skip to the third week and get a head start.Unit: Installing and Using PythonIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs.  We do not require installation of Python for this class.  You can write and test Python programs in the browser using the \"Python Code Playground\" in this lesson.  Please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.Chapter Seven: FilesUp to now, we have been working with data that is read from the user or data in constants.   But real programs process much larger amounts of data by reading and writing files on the secondary storage on your computer.   In this chapter we start to write our first programs that read, scan, and process real data.  Chapter Eight: ListsAs we want to solve more complex problems in Python, we need more powerful variables.  Up to now we have been using simple variables to store numbers or strings where we have a single value in a variable.  Starting with lists we will store many values in a single variable using an indexing scheme to store, organize, and retrieve different values from within a single variable.  We call these multi-valued variables \"collections\" or \"data structures\".Chapter Nine: DictionariesThe Python dictionary is one of its most powerful data structures.  Instead of representing values in a linear list, dictionaries store data as key / value pairs.  Using key / value pairs gives us a simple in-memory \"database\" in a single Python variable.Chapter Ten: TuplesTuples are our third and final basic Python data structure.  Tuples are a simple version of lists.  We often use tuples in conjunction with dictionaries to accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping through all of the data in a dictionary.GraduationTo celebrate your making it to the halfway point in our Python for Everybody Specialization, we welcome you to attend our online graduation ceremony.  It is not very long, and it features a Commencement speaker and very short commencement speech.\n                                    ",

We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization.  These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Getting StartedIn this section you will install Python and a text editor.  In previous classes in the specialization this was an optional assignment, but in this class it is the first requirement to get started.  From this point forward we will stop using the browser-based Python grading environment because the browser-based Python environment (Skulpt) is not capable of running the more complex programs we will be developing in this class.Regular Expressions (Chapter 11)Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings.   Regular expressions are a language unto themselves.  It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful.Networks and Sockets (Chapter 12)In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs).Programs that Surf the Web (Chapter 12)In this section we learn to use Python to retrieve data from web sites and APIs over the Internet.Web Services and XML (Chapter 13)In this section, we learn how to retrieve and parse XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data.JSON and the REST Architecture (Chapter 13)In this module, we work with Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format.\n                                    ",

Ha l’obiettivo di aiutarti ad introdurre il pensiero computazionale in classe attraverso il coding, usando solo attività intuitive e divertenti da proporre direttamente agli alunni.\r\nQuando affrontiamo un problema o abbiamo un’idea, spesso intuiamo la soluzione ma non siamo in grado di formularla in modo operativo per metterla in pratica. Il pensiero computazionale è proprio questo, la capacità di immaginare e descrivere un procedimento costruttivo che porti alla soluzione. Come imparare a parlare ci aiuta a formulare pensieri complessi, così il pensiero computazionale ci offre strumenti ulteriori a supporto della fantasia e della creatività.\r\nPer questo il pensiero computazionale è per tutti. E’ una capacità trasversale che va sviluppata il prima possibile. Non è solo per informatici e programmatori, ma programmare è il modo migliore per acquisirlo. Per questo in Europa e nel mondo si svolgono ogni anno campagne di alfabetizzazione per la diffusione del coding. E’ per questa stessa ragione che noi parleremo di coding e giocheremo con la programmazione senza ripeterci ogni volta che lo facciamo per sviluppare il pensiero computazionale. Quello accadrà da sé senza bisogno di dirlo.\r\nVeniamo al metodo. Questo corso non è concepito per introdurre metodi e concetti che in qualche futuro potranno esservi utili in classe, ma per aiutarvi ad organizzare attività di coding in classe direttamente durante il MOOC. La maggior parte delle lezioni di questo MOOC sono appuntamenti in diretta streaming che potrete seguire in classe con gli alunni, mettendovi in gioco insieme a loro. Non occorre che abbiate dimestichezza con l’informatica, le attività proposte sono intuitive e divertenti e nei video farò del mio meglio per darvi spunti di riflessione ulteriori. Se non riuscirete ad organizzarvi per seguire le lezioni in diretta potrete sempre riusarle successivamente.\r\nCosì creeremo su questa piattaforma una comunità di apprendimento fatta di insegnanti, ciascuno con la propria classe. Starà a me certificare i vostri progressi, mentre voi certificherete quelli dei vostri alunni. Al termine del MOOC tanto voi quanto i vostri alunni avrete acquisito competenze certificate per le quali alcuni atenei italiani, tra i quali l'Università di Urbino, riconoscono un credito formativo universitario.\r\nPer le attività online useremo prevalentemente le risorse di Code.org e Scratch. Per le attività unplugged (senza computer e senza rete) faremo tutto da soli.\r\nDurante il corso avrete modo di condividere con i colleghi e con me l'impostazione delle attività nelle vostre classi e creeremo dei gruppi di valutazione tra pari, all'interno dei quali ciascuno di voi giudicherà l'impostazione proposta dagli altri.\r\nOra non ci resta che iniziare a fare coding in classe. Buon divertimento.\n\n                                    ",

Java developers are highly sought after professionals, and increasingly so, Java is a staple of every technologist’s resume!\n\nThis Java learning series is comprised of three parts, of which Part 1 introduces programming on the basis of familiar concepts, like calculators and games. Powerful concepts such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are progressively introduced throughout the five weeks. Examples and case studies are provided so that learners can implement simple programs on their own or by collaborating with peers.\n\nPart 2 will focus on how to write “good” programs and Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures. Part 2 and Part 3 will be scheduled soon.\n\nProgramming knowledge is not only needed to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones, but it also opens doors to computational thinking, i.e., the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.\n\nWith new content and enhanced problems, this is an improved version of the course released in April 2015. Previous learners are welcome to enroll for a second time, and continue learning!\n\nThroughout this course, emphasis is placed on immediate feedback and having fun. Enroll today and start your journey in the field of computer science!\n\n“This course is Awesome. And professor Carlos, Just WOW!

Examples include enhancements to graphical user interfaces, authoring tools for 2D drawings and 3D animations, and interactive computer-aided design systems. Rich live demonstrations and course assignments will give you insights and skills to design and implement such tools for your own problems.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Graphical User InterfacesGraphical user interfaces turn computer control problem into visual problem solving. The lectures of this module introduce five attempts to enhance current GUI operations such as scrolling interfaces, management of desktop icons, pointing on a large display, digital inking, and vocal interaction.2D Drawings and AnimationsIn this module we will dive deep into the world of 2D. We will discuss techniques for authoring 2D drawings and animations. Specifically, we will introduce interactive diagram beautification, pen-and-ink texture synthesis, shape manipulation, and dynamic illustrations. We hope you will witness how interactive software can change burdensome drawing work into full of fun!3D Geometric ModelingIn this module, we rise up from 2D plane to 3D space, and discuss 3D geometric modeling methods. Topics introduced are; suggestive interface for architectural models, a sketch-based modeling system for freeform shapes, a curve-based shape control method, a flower modeling system, and volumetric texture. You will see how 3D objects can be easily and quickly modeled by specially-designed 2D user interfaces!Deformation and AnimationStarting from this module, we are shifting our attention towards simulating/crafting real objects and movements, which usually require intricate systems to deal with. As for this module, we will introduce clothing manipulation techniques, layer operations for stacked deformable objects, spatial key framing for character animations, procedural deformation, and human motion visualization using stick figures. You will discover how deformation and animation techniques help visually reproduce complex objects and motions.FabricationIn this module, we will discuss systems for supporting personal fabrication. In particular, we will introduce systems for designing plush toys, beadworks, chairs, and softly folded objects. In addition, interactive packing method is presented.Computer-aided DesignNowadays, computers are indispensable for designing products; computers mediate the interaction between designers and products. But in most cases, designing and testing processes are separated, so that designers will not foresee the consequences of their design in real time.\nIn this module, we will discuss computer-aided design supported by simultaneous physical simulation. The works introduced are: systems for designing cantilever, musical instruments, garments, furniture, and gliders. You will see how real-time feedback helps designers improve the output products!Real-world InteractionComputer-operated appliances, such as robotic cleaners, are gradually spreading to general households in recent years. These emerging technologies have opened the door to the new research area, i.e. research on the interactions between ordinary people and robots. In this module, we will discuss interactive techniques and systems for real world interaction. Topics include: a command card interface for robot control, style-by-demonstration for robot behavior design, an actuated puppet device for character posing, a painting interface for robotic lights, and a fur display.ExtrasCreate your own application in \"Optional Challenge: Build Your Own Application\", peer-reviewed gallery type assignment!

Si bien te podrá parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos básicos verás qué rápido se avanza.\nJava, como todos los lenguajes de programación bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con más trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de cómo piensas la solución al problema). \nPero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extraño, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como tú quieres y obtengas una satisfacción enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.\nEn este curso aprenderás:\n1. El proceso de desarrollar y ejecutar un programa.\n2. Qué es la orientación a objetos (OO).\n3. Qué es un “objeto” en el contexto de programación.\n4.

But before you share your apps on the Internet you should protect your users' data, ensuring information stored on your site is safe from unwanted manipulation. You could implement web security and permissions on your own, but relying on trusted providers is a faster, safer, and easier way to allow users to login to your application - without having to create and maintain another account, profile, and password. \n\nIn this course, you will learn to implement the OAuth 2.0 framework to allow users to securely login to your web applications. You'll be provided a  restaurant menu application created in Flask. By the end of this course, you will write the necessary code to implement Google+ Sign-In and Facebook Login in options so users can create restaurant menus that are viewable by everyone but only modifiable by the original creator.Why Take This Course?OAuth 2.0 is a popular framework that allows users to login to your web application by using  third party sign ins, from providers they've already created and trust, with the click of a button. And because passwords and sensitive data are never sent, your web application does not have to deal with the complexities of secure password storage and security breaches. Your users can then control the level of access your application has to their data, and change or revoke this access at any point in time.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1 - Authentication vs. Authorization\nLearn the difference between the concepts of authentication and authorization and address some major security concerns that developers must protect against when developing a web application.  You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground.\n\n### Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-In\nLearn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user's browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.\n\n\n### Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems\nAdd python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider's API.\n\n###Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook &amp; Other Providers\nLearn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application. You will add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users and understand how to use OAuth provider documentation to add as many providers as you see fit for your application.\n                                    ",

Whatever the discipline or discourse it is important to be able to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning. The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.\r\nThe fundamental question that we will address in this course is \"when does one statement necessarily follow from another\" --- or in the terminology of the course, \"when is one statement a logical consequence of another\". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.\r\nIn this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic. We will start right from the beginning, assuming no prior exposure to this or similar material, and progress through discussions of the proof and model theories of propositional and first-order logic.\r\nWe will proceed by giving a theory of truth, and of logical consequence, based on a formal language called FOL (the language of First-Order Logic). We adopt a formal language for making statements, since natural languages (like English, for example) are far too vague and ambiguous for us to analyze sufficiently. Armed with the formal language, we will be able to model the notions of truth, proof and consequence, among others.\r\nWhile logic is technical in nature, the key concepts in the course will be developed by considering natural English statements, and we will focus the relationships between such statements and their FOL counterparts. The goal of the course is to show how natural English statements and arguments can be formalized and analyzed.\r\n\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nThis course has no prerequisites except an interest in the way in which we use language to construct arguments and justify conclusions. If that interests you, then you're all set! Go sign up.\r\n\n\n                                    ",

This evolution intensifies the demands on SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP (AS ABAP) to best leverage the features and capabilities of the SAP HANA database. As an ABAP developer you might ask, what is important and necessary to know concerning ABAP development for SAP HANA?\r\nThis course is aimed at answering this and other related questions. You are welcome to follow the course without prior technical knowledge of ABAP development or SAP HANA, although prior knowledge is beneficial.\r\nAfter completing the course, you will understand the important concepts in ABAP development for SAP HANA, how to detect and analyze the performance of your ABAP coding, and which features AS ABAP provides for database-oriented programming.\r\nRegistration, learning content, and the final exam are free of charge. However, to gain maximum benefit from the course, you can access a fee-based system environment where you can develop your own code. We’ll explain how you can access this system environment in the first week of the course.\r\nCourse Requirements\r\n\r\nBasic knowledge of ABAP programming and Open SQL\r\nBasic programming skills\r\nBeneficial: A general understanding of SAP HANA, for example, from the openSAP course \"An Introduction to SAP HANA by Dr. Vishal Sikka\"\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Getting Started\r\nThe first week is dedicated to getting you on board and introducing technical concepts and architecture information, primarily from an ABAP developer’s point of view. As well as the important concepts of ABAP development for SAP HANA, there will be an introduction to the development tools.\r\nWeek 2: ABAP Coding – Where to Optimize?\r\nWhat happens when you migrate coding to SAP HANA? This and related questions are answered in the second week of this course. There are a large variety of tools available in AS ABAP to detect and analyze ABAP coding, for example, to ensure functional correctness and to analyze performance. You’ll learn about guided performance analysis tools and optimized components like the well-known ABAP List Viewer, which have been enhanced to dramatically improve performance.\r\nWeek 3: ABAP Coding – Ready, Set, Optimize!\r\nHaving learned about where to optimize ABAP coding, this week is dedicated to introducing the new features and capabilities of AS ABAP 7.4, with special emphasis on database-oriented programming. Beside the Open SQL enhancements, you’ll learn about advanced view definition capabilities by means of Core Data Services.\r\nWeek 4: Digging Deeper and Outlook\r\nThe capabilities of AS ABAP 7.4 discussed in the previous week do not span the full feature set of SAP HANA. Therefore, ABAP for SAP HANA developers might need to dig even deeper and work more natively with SAP HANA. We’ll see how AS ABAP 7.4 supports this task. Finally, we’ll give an example of how the presented features can be used in an analytical app. Beside the Open SQL enhancements, you’ll learn about advanced view definition capabilities by means of Core Data Services.\r\nWeek 5: Final Exam\n                                    ",

At its core, it is an innovative, in-memory, relational database management system that exploits all the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, reduce total cost of ownership, and enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.\r\nSAP HANA enables you to build applications that integrate the business logic, the control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key issues is how to minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.\r\nThis course will build upon last year’s Introduction to Software Development on SAP HANA course and go deeper into each of the major topics around SAP HANA native development. We will explore the many advances in the programming model and tooling that came with SAP HANA SPS6, SPS7, and SPS8.During the course, we will use SAP HANA studio as well as several new Web-based tools (for example, the Web-based Development Workbench, SAP HANA Lifecycle Management, and SAP HANA XS Administration Tool).We will also go well beyond the basics of each of the programming models, allowing discussion of deeper, real-world patterns and anti-patterns. We will look at the architecture of applications that are not just read-only or analytic but also transactional or provide an interface with transactional systems. We will also look at the extended capabilities of SAP HANA, from beyond a database to a complete application platform.\r\nRegistration, learning content, final exam, and Record of Achievement are free of charge.

You’ll learn by doing, and will build byte-sized (ha!) mini projects in each lesson to learn and practice programming concepts. \n\nWe’ve heard that programming can be intimidating for newcomers, and we’ve created this course to make sure that you have a great learning experience! You’ll learn ***actively*** with our mini projects (see the awesome list below), which you’ll be able to share proudly with your friends. You’ll also learn important programming concepts one by one, with no surprises or leaps of logic along the way. \n\nYou’ll pick up some great tools for your programming toolkit in this course! You will: \n\n- Start coding in the programming language Python;\n- Reuse and share code with Object-Oriented Programming;\n- Create and share amazing, life-hacking projects!   \n\n\nThis introductory course is for you if you want to be a software engineer, or if you want to collaborate with programmers. Mastering Object-Oriented Programming will propel your career in tech forward, and it’s also a great way to learn how software engineers think about solving problems.\n\nThis course is also a part of our Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.Why Take This Course?You should take this course if you want to build awesome projects, while writing only a few lines of code. Here are some of them:\n\n- **Project Take a Break**: Do you know a friend who works too many hours? We will write a program that schedules breaks throughout the day -- reminding your friend to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song, or just walk away from the computer every once in awhile. http://youtu.be/C29aerpwkc8\n- **Project Profanity Editor**: Imagine it’s late at night and you get an email from your boss, requesting your help with something. You reply,  “I can take a shot at it” but accidentally end up including an awkward word (sh*t). Oops. We will write a python program that detects curse words, and saves clumsy email writers from embarrassing moments. http://youtu.be/Rvj2UI-wVXA\n- **Movie Website**: We will learn how to make an awesome webpage that lists your favorite movies and shows their trailers. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0FoelOIZM0&amp;t=1m24s\n\n\nWhile building these projects we will learn about a programming technique that is used by software engineers on a daily basis; it is called Object-Oriented Programming. \n\nFinally, we will work together to get better at reading help documents and using other people’s code almost like lego blocks to build our programs. By building these projects, you’ll become more confident in your ability to code and transition from “programming looks like magic” to “oh, I can do that.”\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 0: Introduction (30 min)\nWe will begin with an introduction from the instructor. More specifically, we will talk about the projects we will build and the ideas we will learn in this course. Then we will conduct a short test to ensure you have all the prerequisites necessary for the course. Finally, we will work together to download Python on your computer.\n\n### Lesson 1: Using Functions (3.5 hours)\nWe will use functions (webbrowser.open and os.rename) from the Python Standard Library to build two projects in this lesson. After that we will present a scenario where using functions will not present a very elegant solution; this will illuminate the need for a new programming tool called Classes.\n\n### Lesson 2: Using Classes (5 hours)\nHere we will learn about important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and instances. We will build three cool projects while using classes. These include drawing shapes with Turtle, sending text messages with Twilio and checking curse words with a function called open.\n\nWe will leverage modules from within the Python Standard Library and also learn to download and use an external Python package (twilio).\n\n### Lesson 3: Making Classes (5 hours)\nIn this lesson we will learn to create our first class. While doing this we will build a website that plays trailers of your favorite movies. Here are some of the programming ideas we will learn in this lesson:\n\n- How to create a class\n- How to instantiate an object\n- How to access class attributes and methods \n- What is the self keyword\n- What are constructors (\\__init__)\n- What are DocStrings\n- How to create and access Class Variables\n- How does Inheritance work\n- How to override methods  \n\n### Final Project (6 hours)\nHere, you will use the skills learned in this course to identify a problem statement and idea for a project. You will then identify step-by step directions (in simple English) to design a solution for the previously identified problem. Finally, you will use this design and your newly learned object-oriented programming skills to write code to realize your project.\n                                    ",

Developers and the software industry are used to applications becoming faster by merely exchanging the underlying hardware. However, since the beginning of the century it has become apparent that this approach no longer works.\r\nMoore's law about the ever-increasing number of transistors per chip is still valid, but power consumption, thermal management and memory latency issues are making make serial code acceleration increasingly harder. Instead, hardware vendors now use additional transistors for multiple processing elements (‘cores’) per processor chip and deeper memory hierarchies. Modern hardware has the capability to transform any desktop, server, or even mobile system into some kind of parallel computer. This makes parallel programming the new default for application development. The exploitation of any additional horsepower from hardware is now in the responsibility of the software.\r\nThe openHPI online course “Parallel Programming Concepts” presents relevant theoretical and practical foundations for parallel programming. We show crucial theoretical ideas such as semaphores and actors, the architecture of modern parallel hardware, different programming models such as task parallelism, message passing and functional programming, and several patterns and best practices.\r\nThe course is suitable for all participants who are interested in getting a broader overview of parallelism, especially beyond the usage of multiple threads.

At its core, it is an innovative in-memory relational database management system that makes full sense of the capabilities of current hardware to increase application performance, to reduce cost of ownership, and to enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before.\r\n\r\nWith SAP HANA, you have the opportunity to build applications that integrate the business logic, control logic, and the database layer with unprecedented performance. As a developer, one of the key questions is how you can minimize data movements. The more you can do directly on the data in memory next to the CPUs, the better the application will perform.\r\n\r\nThis course will introduce you to native software development on SAP HANA. Registration, learning content, and the final exam are free of charge. However, to fully benefit from the course, you can access a fee-based system environment to develop your own code. SAP works with several cloud providers to give you a choice of infrastructure platforms and attractive pricing models to enable system access at a very low cost.\n\n                                    ",

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\n                                    ",

We will cover basic operations about computer, then move on to how to write computer program in a language called C. Various C concepts will be introduced.\n\n\n授課形式 (Course format)\n\nWe will have video lecture to introduce the concept of programming. The video will switch between the presentation slides and the actual coding process. After that we will have weekly programming homework to ensure that the students are able to practice what they learned from the video presentation. The students will practice on ideone.com, a web platform for compiling and running computer programs.\n\n\n修課背景要求 (Recommended background)\n\nNo special prior computer knowledge is required. However, the students are expected to be able to use a web browser, has basic English vocabulary, and arithmetic skills of junior high school graduates.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 - IntroductionWe start with basic programming concepts that correspond to chapter 1, 2, 3 of the book. We will start with a basic program and gradually add computation statements so that our program will perform useful computation. Also we will use an online interface (ideone) to describe the process of editing, compiling and running a program. Week 2 - Control StructureThe second week will describe flow control and loops (book chapter 4, 5). After we learn how to write a program to perform basic computation in the first week, we start to learn the control structure of a program. We will learn how to control the execution of a program among several possible \"next steps\", and how to repeat the computation to finish repetitive tasks. We will also describe certain loop ending practice, which strongly relates to programming style. Week 3 - ArrayThe third week describes arrays and floating point numbers (book chapter 6, 7). We will introduce ways to organize related data into the most basic data structure, i.e., array. We will describe the circumstance of using an array, and the most useful idioms in using them. Various examples will be introduced to enforce the concepts in using array correctly. We will also describe the concept of floating point numbers, which is different from the integers we introduce at the beginning of this course.Week 4 - FunctionsThe fourth will will describe the concept of functions (book chapter 8). We will motivate the use of function by system functions, including mathematic and input/output functions, so we the students can understand the key concept that if we can use existing code, then we do not need to reinvent the wheel. Then we will introduce the way to define our own functions. The key mechanism of function call, parameter passing, and return values wiill be discussed by a series of examples. Week 5 - PointerIn the fifth week we will describe pointers (book chapter 9). We will focus on the semantic of pointers and then introduce the mechanism of using pointers. Here we would like to tie together the pointer concept with memory layout, i.e., the way the computer system places variables into memory. After the introduction of memory layout the students will have a very clear idea on how a computer system manages the memory, and how this layout affects the way we write program that handles variables of different types in C.Week 6 - StringThe sixth week will describe strings and characters (book chapter 10, 11). Up to this point in this course we deal with only numeric data. Now we are ready to introduce character and string that deal with mainly text data. We will introduce the concept of memory bits, and different types in C only means different ways to interpret the memory bits. We start with character, which is the basic unit of text information. Then we introduce string as an array of characters, and various useful functions to perform various operations on strings. Final Exam\n                                    ",

Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Asteroids\".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- reason about task and data parallel programs,\n- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,\n- competently microbenchmark parallel code,\n- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

Examples such as array norm and Monte Carlo computations illustrate these concepts. We show how to estimate work and depth of parallel programs as well as how to benchmark the implementations.Basic Task Parallel AlgorithmsWe continue with examples of parallel algorithms by presenting a parallel merge sort. We then explain how operations such as map, reduce, and scan can be computed in parallel. We present associativity as the key condition enabling parallel implementation of reduce and scan.Data-ParallelismWe show how data parallel operations enable the development of elegant data-parallel code in Scala. We give an overview of the parallel collections hierarchy, including the traits of splitters and combiners that complement iterators and builders from the sequential case.Data Structures for Parallel ComputingWe give a glimpse of the internals of data structures for parallel computing, which helps us understand what is happening under the hood of parallel collections.\n                                    ",

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming.

We will learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. We will learn about syntax and semantics. We will see ways in which MATLAB provides help. Finally, we will learn how to create plots in MATLAB.Matrices and OperatorsThe basic unit with which we work in MATLAB is the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. We will learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. We will learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and we will learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. Finally, we will learn MATLAB’s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression.FunctionsFunctions let us break up complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. We will learn how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs. We will learn how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a well defined interface through which it communicates with that outside world. We will learn how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done.Programmer's ToolboxMATLAB has useful built-in functions and we will explore many of them in this section. We will learn about polymorphism and how MATLAB exploits it to change a function's behavior on the basis of the number and type of its inputs. Because random numbers play an important role in computer programming, we will learn how to use the MATLAB random number generator. We will learn how to get input from the keyboard, how to print to the Command Window, and how to plot graphs in a Figure window. Finally, we will learn how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger.SelectionSelection is the means by which MATLAB makes decisions about the order in which it executes its statements. We will learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection. We will learn how to use relational operators and logical operators. We will learn how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error.LoopsLoops give computers their power. We will learn how to use both of MATLAB's loop constructs: the for-loop and the while-loop. We will learn how the break-statement works, and we will use nested loops. We will learn how to make loops more efficient. We will learn about logical indexing and will see how to use it to produce implicit loops that are efficient and easy for a user to understand.Data TypesComputers operate on bits, but humans think in terms of numbers, words, and other types of data. Like any good language, MATLAB organizes bits into convenient data types. We will study those types in this section. We will learn that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another. We will learn much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers. We will learn how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells.File Input/OutputFiles are named areas in permanent memory for storing data that can be used as input or output to MATLAB and to other programs. We will be introduced to MATLAB’s most important methods for reading and writing files. We will learn how to create, read from, and write into MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files. We will learn how to navigate among folders with MATLAB commands.\n                                    ",

You will see that programming is more than just coding--it involves strategic thinking and design as well. You will learn how to design programs to solve problems that require solutions that scale. You will also learn about the Java Collections classes and how Java interfaces facilitate developing programs that scale.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Use sorting appropriately in solving problems;\n2. Develop classes that implement the Comparable interface;\n3. Use timing data to analyze empirical performance;\n4. Break problems into multiple classes, each with their own methods;\n5. Determine if a class from the Java API can be used in solving a particular problem;\n6. Implement programming solutions using multiple approaches and recognize tradeoffs;\n7. Use object-oriented concepts including interfaces and abstract classes when developing programs;\n8. Appropriately hide implementation decisions so they are not visible in public methods; and\n9. Recognize the limitations of algorithms and Java programs in solving problems.\n10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms including exception-handling, static methods, java.net, and java.io packages;\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to the CourseWelcome to “Java Programming: Principles of Software Design”! We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will hear an overview of this course and be introduced to the supporting resources available.Earthquakes: Programming and InterfacesIn this module, we will introduce a data set containing details about earthquakes around the world. You will learn how to pull this data into a program, search through the data, and filter the data based on desired criteria. By the end of this module, you will be able to (1) write programs that include multiple classes and ArrayLists of class types, (2) find the maximum value in an ArrayList, (3) use a Filter interface to search through data, (4) implement interfaces with method signatures, and (5) combine several filters together.Earthquakes: Sorting AlgorithmsIn this module, you will continue using real earthquake data to explore several sorting algorithms. You will learn how to implement a selection sort and a bubble sort, then be introduced to a Java method Collections.sort, which sorts with much greater efficiency. By the end of this module, you will be able to (1) implement several sorting algorithms from scratch, (2) use efficient pre-existing sorting classes, (3) modify a class’s compareTo method to choose the criteria by which objects of that type are ordered, and (4) write classes that implement the Comparator interface to create interchangeable sorting criteria.N-Grams: Predictive TextIn this module, you will explore some of the underlying concepts of predictive text. The first lesson will introduce random character generation and then how to train the character selection based on an input text. The second lesson will extend this concept to complete words. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) base random text generation on the frequency of characters in a training text, (2) collect a set of characters that occur in a text after randomly chosen initial character(s) to create a semi-random text, (3) extend the predictive text generation to use whole words, and (4) implement your own .equals method to compare complex data types.Java: Tools and Libraries for EveryoneAs you reach the end of this series, you may wish to extend your Java experience to tools beyond those provided here. This module will cover some of the Java basic information that is needed to program without BlueJ or the edu.duke library. After completing this module, you will be able to: (1) write a main method to start a Java program in any programming environment, (2) use the “static” keyword to modify fields, (3) find alternative editors to use with Java, (4) use exceptions to debug your program and make it more robust, and (5) reference Java libraries that are necessary to read files without the edu.duke library.\n\n                                    ",

You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. You’ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.\n\nSeveral parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using infinite data structures or functional reactive programming.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n - recognize and apply design principles of functional programs,\n - design functional libraries and their APIs,\n - competently combine functions and state in one program,\n - understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine \n   functions and state,\n - write simple functional reactive applications.\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line. This course is intended to be taken after Functional Programming Principles in Scala: https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        For Expressions and MonadsWe'll start by revisiting some concepts that we have learned from Principles of Functional Programming in Scala; collections, pattern matching, and functions. We'll then touch on for-comprehensions, a powerful way in Scala to traverse a list, process it, and return a new list. We'll see how to do queries with for-comprehensions as well as how the for-comprehension is \"desugared\" into calls to higher-order functions by the Scala compiler. Finally, we'll discuss what monads are, and how to verify that the monad laws are satisfied for a number of examples.Lazy EvaluationThis week we'll revisit performance issues caused by combinatorial search, and we'll discover an important concept in functional programming that can these issues: laziness. We'll also learn a little bit about proofs on trees; in particular, we'll see how to extend structural induction to trees.Functions and StateThis week, we'll learn about state and side-effects. Through a rich example, we'll learn programming patterns for managing state in larger programs. We'll also learn about for-loops and while-loops in Scala.Timely EffectsThis week we'll learn a number of important programming patterns via examples, starting with the observer pattern, and then going on to functional reactive programming. We'll learn how latency can be modeled as an effect, and how latency can be handled with Scala's monadic futures. We'll learn the important combinators on futures as well as how they can be composed to build up rich and responsive services.\n                                    ",

But it doesn't have to be this way. Agile and design thinking offer a different--and effective--approach to product development, one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems. In this course, you’ll learn how to determine what's valuable to a user early in the process--to frontload value--by focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective. \n\nWe’ll show you how to:\n- Explain key concepts and practices from the agile product development methodology\n- Create a strong shared perspective and drive to value using personas and problem scenarios\n- Diagnose what software to develop and why using a set of agile user stories and prototypes\n- Facilitate narrative collaboration with user stories and prototypes \n- Allow for early testing and validation by analyzing and deciding on story backlogs\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

In this module, we’ll identify what’s hard about creating excellent products and how agile can help. We'll begin with a discussion of the Agile Manifesto, introduce key agile terminology, and explore how agile arose from previous development practices. Then we'll look at what makes implementing agile so challenging and make a case for why it's worth it and how to do it. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of agile processes and be prepared to use the Venture Design Template to work through project development and drive toward valuable outcomes.Agile Design with Personas, Problem Scenarios, and AlternativesThe best way to avoid building something nobody wants is to start with somebody in mind. That \"somebody\" is a persona. Personas and problem scenarios tie development to the end user and help you drive toward a valuable solution. In this module, you’ll learn to develop personas, problem scenarios, and alternatives using best practices from design thinking.Writing Great Agile User StoriesCreating software that meets users' need begins with understanding that user--and user stories are a tool that helps teams understand the end-user perspective.The agile user story is the focal point for just about everything that follows. This is where we diagnose what we think we should do for the user and why, and how we’ll know if we did something relevant (or created waste). In this module, you'll learn how to conduct effective, efficient discovery, from creating an interview guide to interviewing users. You'll finish with creating Google AdWords-ready copy and drafting your personas, problem scenarios and alternatives.Enhancing Your User StoryNow that you've \"discovered\" your user, you'll write your user story--and you'll make it great by layering in details. In this module, you'll learn to create detailed, specific user stories to anchor your project.Finish User Stories Assignment and Optional Content with an IT Focus: Strategy-Driven Process DesignFirst, use this week to finish up your User Story Assignment and complete peer reviews.Then, if you're interested in IT, let's talk process. What? Process? While you’ve learned that the agile manifesto explicitly reacted to primary/excessive use of tools and processes, agile is not categorically the enemy of process. After all, most of what we do follows some kind of process/habit. In this module, you’ll learn how to use thoughtful, adaptive processes as a tool  both for your internal processes as well as for prototyping for work in enterprise software.\n                                    ",

You’ll finish the week with a deeper understanding of how to pair your project’s most important facets with the best of what agile has to offer.Learning and DecidingOne of the major promises of agile is to manage the complexities of software development for the best possible outcomes and working environments. Part and parcel of that is strong interdisciplinary collaboration paired with lightweight self-organizing management practices. This week, you’ll learn practical tactics from scrum and XP to promote faster learning and smarter decisions, and how you can use kanban to improve your workflow. Building, Managing, and IntroducingThis week we’ll dive into the jobs of building software and the core management jobs in running an agile team. Agile--and XP in particular--offers a rich body of work on specific coding practices. We’ll step through a few of the most prominent and discuss key linkages with the other concepts and practices you’ve learned. On the job of managing, we’ll dive deeper into what that means and what works in an agile context. We’ll close with ideas and case studies for introducing (or reintroducing) agile to your organization. Planning an IterationNow that you’ve learned about the four jobs of software development, you’ll have a chance to think through how they relate to your work in this week’s peer-reviewed assignment. You’ll finish the course with a clear plan to accomplish the jobs of learning, deciding, building, and managing for your project.\n                                    ",

Design sprints allow you to meet clients' desire for solutions--to develop sooner--and still adjust based on feedback. But not all sprints are alike. In this course, you’ll learn how to run situation-appropriate sprints, whether it's testing user motivation, interface usability, or solution fit, to avoid waste and deliver value. \n\nWe'll show you how to: \n- Plan and conduct a design sprint that delivers valuable, actionable insights\n- Effectively test motivation and value propositions\n- Effectively test user interface (even without working software)\n- Focus and drive to actionable conclusions on questions of approach and architecture\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business. The Batten Institute’s mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation: www.batteninstitute.org.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Your Next Design SprintThe role of the design sprint is to make (just enough) room to discover what will be valuable to your user before you start spending a lot of money to build a product. Given the failure rate of new products, this is a critical process--and surprisingly hard to sell to clients and managers. In this module, you'll learn how to plan and run effective design sprints that allow you the space to discover and still keep your team on track. By staying focused on outcomes in a defined time frame, you'll  prove the value of design sprints to clients and managers.Testing Problem Scenarios in Design SprintsEven if we deliver the perfectly built solution (on time, on budget, beautifully designed), if it is for a problem that doesn’t exist, we've failed. You can avoid poor outcomes with a very moderate time commitment. In this module, you’ll learn how to plan and manage a one-week design sprint to test problem scenarios.Testing Motivation in Design SprintsNone of us want to waste our time creating something no one wants, and yet just asking people what they want doesn't yield accurate results. Instead, you need to systematically assess user motivation so you can zero in on software implementations worth building. In this module, you'll learn to test user  motivation with Lean Startup so you make sure what you're building matters to the user. You'll also figure out your assumptions and brainstorm test vehicles for your peer-reviewed assignment. Plan to spend time reviewing your peers' assignments as well--it's a great way to learn and helps everyone get feedback quickly.Testing Usability in Design SprintsUsabilty testing is all about how easy your user interface is for your users to use. But testing usability can be tricky and needs to be tightly calibrated. In this module, you’ll learn how to use existing user interface patterns to streamline development and how to design and run phase-appropriate usability sprints.Testing Approach and Architecture in Design SprintsIn software design, you have a lot of choices about what tools to use. Making the right choice is important because, in practice, there often aren’t that many really great alternatives. In this module, you’ll learn how to manage toward smart decisions and good choices. You'll also complete a peer-reviewed assignment to help you think through how to run each sprint and to determine which sprint to run next. Remember to review your peers' assignments promptly so they can earn their course certificate!\n                                    ",

It's this commitment to experimenting that's at the heart of today’s most successful implementations of agile. This course shows you how to integrate the practice of experimentation across concept testing, usability testing, functional testing, and continuous deployment. \n\nBasically, we’ll show you how to use experiments to answer these three big questions: \n     Should we build it? (And then: Did it matter?)\n     Is it usable?\n     Did it break?\n\nWe'll show you how to: \n- Translate your product’s strategic direction into a user-centric charter with lots of small, testable ideas\n- Test user motivation to make sure you’re building something that matters\n- Design and conduct usability testing (even without working software)\n- Use narrative collaboration to focus your testing \n- Integrate functional testing into a more continuous release flow\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

Did it matter?Ultimately, agile’s backbone is the substitution of observable results over the false certainty of elaborate plans. You’ve learned to avoid waste by validating problems/needs and user motivation before investing in software. Putting that testing into practice takes skill and the right kind of project charter--one that allows you to break the work into small(ish), testable ideas. In this module you’ll learn how to put that into practice by making concept testing an integral part of your culture of experimentation. You’ll go deeper on the Lean Startup techniques you’ve learned to test motivation. We’ll look at how to design and run situation-appropriate experiments, and how that works before the fact (when you’re testing an idea) and after the fact (when you’re testing the value of some working software)Is it usable?The best products are tested for usability early and often, avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a ‘big unveil’. In this module, we’ll look at how to diagnose, design and execute phase-appropriate user testing as a standard practice. Anyone can learn to use the test plan template, prototyping tool, and supporting methods you’ll learn here. And that’s a very good thing! Very often products are released with poor usability because there ‘wasn’t enough time’ to test it. With these techniques, you’ll be able to test early and often, reinforcing your culture of experimentation.Does it break?The practice of continuous delivery and the closely related DevOps movement are changing the way we build and release software. It wasn’t that long ago where 2-3 releases a year was considered standard. Large firms like Facebook now release new code twice a day. How do they do it? In this module, we’ll look at the whole continuous delivery pipeline and step through what successful practitioners do at each stage and how you can diagnose and apply the practices that will improve your implementation of agile. Most of these practices build on concepts we’ve covered and we’ll pay special attention to those linkages.Your Continuous DeliveryYou've learned about the continuous delivery pipeline and how to improve cycle time. In this module, you'll apply that learning to improve your own processes.\n                                    ",

Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Pong\".  \n\nRecommended Background - A knowledge of high school mathematics is required. While the class is designed for students with no prior programming experience, some beginning programmers have viewed the class as being fast-paced. For students interested in some light preparation prior to the start of class, we recommend a self-paced Python learning site such as codecademy.com.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 0 - Statements, expressions, variables Understand the structure of this class, explore Python as a calculatorWeek 1 - Functions, logic, conditionalsLearn the basic constructs of Python programming, create a program that plays a variant of Rock-Paper-ScissorsWeek 2 - Event-driven programming, local/global variablesLearn the basics of event-driven programming, understand difference between local and global variables, create an interactive program that plays a simple guessing gameWeek 3 - Canvas, drawing, timersCreate a canvas in Python, learn how to draw on the canvas, create a digital stopwatchWeek 4 - Lists, keyboard input, the basics of modeling motionLearn the basics of lists in Python, model moving objects in Python, recreate the classic arcade game \"Pong\"\n                                    ",

We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will hear an overview of this course and be introduced to the supporting resources available.Cryptography: Keeping Information SecretIn this module, you will learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure. You will learn about simpler cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. You will learn how to implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them. To solve these problems, you will work more with processing Strings, but also learn about arrays—a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. You will be able to: (1) combine Strings using concatenation; (2) build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder; (3) use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data; (4) refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles; (5) and practice effective algorithm design.GladLibs: Stories from TemplatesAfter completing this module, you will be able (1) to program a word frequency counter to analyze any input text file, (2) to select and substitute words from a list into a document template using both ArrayList and HashMap, (3) to create new lists to use in templates, (4) to recognize brittle code, and (5) to improve code with flexible, object-oriented design. You will gain these skills in the framework of developing a randomly generated story that we call GladLibs. You may discover that bald lions change peoples’ lives, or that fluffy dinosaurs get things done in a jiffy. We hope you have fun developing your Java skills this week!Web Server Logs: From Logs to VisitsIn this module, you will learn about how web server logs store information about visitors to a website, and you will write programs to access information like user IP address, date and time of access, and more. Using Java programs you write in this module, you will be able (1) to read information from a web server log, (2) to count the number of unique visitors to your website, and (3) to count the number of times each visitor uses your website.MiniProject: Vigenère CipherIn this module, you will develop a program to break the Vigenère Cipher, a more complex version of the Caesar Cipher. You will improve your program in three stages: first decrypting messages where you know the language and key length, then adding the capability to handle messages with unknown key length, then extending the program to handle messages in a range of possible languages. Through this project, you will be able (1) to effectively use HashSet and HashMap, (2) to expand an algorithm from solving a simpler problem to handle broader, more complex problems, and (3) to design and modify program code involving a more complex collection of classes, methods, and data. \n                                    ",

We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will get to meet the instructor team from Duke University, have an overview of the course, and hear from Google engineers about why they find programming exciting and why Java is important. Have fun!Iterables in JavaIn this module, you will learn to design and run your first Java programs, including one program that prints “Hello!” in various countries’ languages and another where you will copy and edit many files by converting color images to grayscale. To accomplish these tasks, you will learn about classes constructed for this course: Iterables libraries that allow you to perform the same task over multiple lines in a document or webpage or multiple files within a directory. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Download and run BlueJ, the Java programming environment for this course; (2) Access the documentation for the Java libraries specially designed for this course; (3) Edit, compile, and run a Java program; (4) Construct for loops in Java; and (5) Use Iterables to run a program that iterates over multiples lines in a document or webpage or multiple files in a directory.Strings in JavaThis module begins with a short presentation from Raluca Gordân, an assistant professor in Duke University’s Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, about an important problem genomics scientists encounter regularly: how to identify genes in a strand of DNA. To tackle this problem, you will need to understand strings: series of characters such as letters, digits, punctuation, etc. After learning about Java methods that work with strings, you will be able to find genes within a DNA string as well as tackle other string related problems, such as finding all of the links in a web page. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Use important methods for the Java String class; (2) Use conditionals, for loops, and while loops appropriately in a Java program; (3) Find patterns in the data represented by strings to help develop the algorithm for your program; (4) Understand the importance of designing programs that keep different data processing steps separate; (5) Use the StorageResource iterable for this course to store some data for further processing; and (6) Rely on Java documentation to better understand how to use different Java packages and classes.CSV Files and Basic Statistics in JavaA common format for storing tabular data (any data organized into columns and rows) is in comma separated values (CSV) files. In this module, you will learn how to analyze and manipulate data from multiple CSV data files using a powerful open-source software package: Apache Commons CSV. Using this library will empower you to solve problems that could prove too complex to solve with a spreadsheet. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Use the open-source Apache Commons CSV package in your own Java programs; (2) Access data from one or many CSV files using Java; (3) Convert strings into numbers; (4) Understand how to use “null” in Java programs (when you want to represent “nothing”); (5) Devise an algorithm (and implement in Java) to answer questions about CSV data; and (6) Analyze CSV data across multiple CSV files (for example, find maximums, minimums, averages, and other simple statistical results).MiniProject: Baby NamesThis module wraps up the course with a mini project that ties together the different practices, skills, and libraries you have gained across the course! Using data on the popularity of different baby names in the United States from the past several decades, you will be able to compare different names’ popularity over time. While the data we have collected for this course is from the United States, we welcome you to share data from other countries in the course discussion forums. Good luck with the mini project!\n                                    ",

We will consider how to effectively find and analyse sources and explore the potential of DNA testing as applied to genealogy. We’ll help you add historical context to your family history and discuss how to record and communicate research findings in a clear fashion. The course is primarily designed for people at beginner to intermediate level.\n\nLearn how to find and store information on your family tree\nWe’ll get you to define what you want to research, and consider the best ways to go about finding and storing information on your family tree. A key challenge of genealogy – finding the right person among a number of possible candidates, with ever-changing spellings of surnames – will be considered.\n\nWe’ll conclude by introducing the main types of tools genealogists use to communicate their research finds, including creating a family tree and look at how to write a meaningful family history.\n\nShare your own genealogy finds with learners worldwide\nThroughout the course, you’ll follow the story of Chris, as she uncovers her own family history, and you’ll be encouraged to share sources and ideas particular to your area of genealogical interest and geographic focus.\n\nThe course will not concentrate on a specific country’s records or how to source these, so it will be useful to anyone around the world.\n\nDevelop your genealogy skills\nThe knowledge you gain from this course may prompt you to explore family history research more deeply or consider a career as a professional genealogist.\n\nYou may even wish to take your learning further, with the University of Strathclyde’s online MSc in Genealogical Palaeographic and Heraldic Studies.\n\n\n\n                                    ",

Learners will be presented information on such foundational principles as motivation, risk taking, two different modes of learning, and balancing the teacher profession.  Learners are also given an understanding of basic techniques founded on those principles, such as teacher talk, looking “ridiculous” in order to lower the affective filter, and networking.   With these foundational principles in mind, ESL/EFL teachers will scrutinize common assumptions about language learning by comparing how they stack up to research-based core principles.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Making Meaning ClearThis course introduces learners to the role of a teacher in helping to motivate and properly engage learners.  It begins with a metaphor: language is cake, meaning that language must be presented well in order to be enjoyed (we will actually perform a skit to show this meaning clearly).  This module will demonstrate how a teacher can encourage a student and increase motivation by paying attention to techniques such as improving teacher talk, scaffolding language, and the use of body language to make meaning clear.  All of these skills, while gained over the course of a lifetime as a language teacher, must be considered primary goals from the very beginning.  And all of these skills help a teacher recognize that presentation skills make a difference to learners not only in motivating them, but in allowing them to understand the concepts presented. Module 2: Modes of Learning and InteractionIn this module, learners are introduced to the distinction between learning and acquisition. The distinction is made to help give learners context for the principle that language requires practice. To introduce the importance of practice, the distinction between a focused and diffuse mode of learning demonstrates that students who simply learn through memorizing vocabulary and grammar structures (focused mode) often don’t acquire language structures. On the other hand, teachers who engage students in both a focused and diffuse mode, like a basketball coach with his players, are able to instruct but give time for that instruction to “sink in” through dedicated practice.  Module 3: Taking Risks and Learner StrategiesUsing language learning expert Francois Gouin’s experience of going to Germany and failing to learn German, this module demonstrates the need for learners to understand how a language is learned. Gouin’s experience demonstrates not only the need for a diffuse mode of learning wherein practice is valued, but it also demonstrates the psyche of many second language learners.  Francois, in some sense, was too smart for his own good, relying on techniques for learning material that don’t apply to language use and application.  Students must use techniques and strategies that are proven to help someone acquire language, like those from the good language learner studies. Teachers can facilitate student learning by helping to demonstrate good language learner principles.   Module 4: The Flipped Model of Language LearningWhile it was once considered impossible to be immersed in English outside of an English-speaking country, with the advent of the internet, the world has changed and continues to change significantly. This module presents ways in which to use the internet and other resources to a teacher’s advantage, and helps a teacher recognize their ability to engage students on cell phones, tablets, and computers.  Introduction of the flipped classroom, meaning that learners can engage in focused material (videos, readings, etc) outside the classroom, and then engage in projects, exercises, and discussions within it.Module 5: Avoiding Teacher BurnoutThis module introduces the concept of teacher burnout, and several techniques to avoid it.  The first technique is the creation of a network.  By creating a network of teachers to help you understand your field, you can learn new ideas and have a resource for solving difficult problems.  The second technique, maintaining control of your teaching environment, demonstrates the need for teachers to understand how to best make a difference and avoid the pitfalls of complaining.  Finally, the third technique, finding your core, explains that teachers can, paradoxically, maintain energy by working tirelessly for the principles they most believe in. Module 6: AssessmentThis review of the course guides learners to understand the different metaphors that serve as guides to understanding the foundational principles presented in this course. \n                                    ",

Learning about India has never been more relevant to our lives and possibly our careers.\n\nThis course, developed through a grant from the U.S. Department of State’s Passport to India initiative, is designed to introduce people of all backgrounds and ages to India and its potential as a destination for study, research, work and entrepreneurship. \n\nWhatever your interests, this course will help you develop a more informed perspective on the importance of India. The sheer diversity and scale of India are reasons enough for making India not just important but fascinating too.\n\nMany agree that two of the rising trends of the coming decades are the re-emergence of Asia and technological change. India is at the heart of both trends and shares much in common with the United States.\n\nAt the current pace of change, we may see:\n\n•\tWithin 10 years, India is likely to overtake China and have the world’s largest population\n•\tIn 20 years, New Delhi overtaking Tokyo as the world’s largest city\n•\tIn 30 years, India could overtake China and the US as the world’s largest economy\n\nBy the time a current college student is the same age as their parents are today – the world will have changed dramatically. India’s importance is growing by the day and could very well have far-reaching implications for your life and career.\n\nEach week of this interactive course explores one major theme related to India’s importance in an interdisciplinary way.\n\nThis course is brought to you by the U.S. Department of State’s Passport to India initiative and is developed through a partnership between The Ohio State University and IndoGenius.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Why India?

After introducing the course - we explore reasons why it is important to learn more about, from, with, and in India. \n\nWe then demonstrate the scale of India's population and economy - including considering projections which show India might well become the largest economy in the world at some point in the 21st Century. \n\nIn our final part we share some reasons why India might be the most \"interesting\" country in the world because of the simultaneity of the changes it is undergoing and the digital age context in which these are occurring.InfluenceThis module has us embarking on a tour of history showing how India has been a much more influential player in the human story than is widely recognized.DiversityAcross the Indian subcontinent from the Himalayas in the North to the Rainforests in the South, in this module we will explore and see how geology and the Monsoon weather system have shaped the most diverse country in the world. ComplexityIn this module, we demonstrate the complexity of India by considering the interplay of politics, socio-economics and belief using the vast range of secular and religious events, festivals and nationally observed holidays as our starting point.CreativityThe birthplace of modern mathematics, meditation and yoga is now a hotbed of 21st Century innovation and home to the world’s fastest growing startup ecosystem. Let's explore some of India's monumental creativity before considering if India is innovative today. How is the Government of India using technology to solve the country's challengesOpportunityWe introduce the fastest growing startup ecosystem in the world and look at a number of opportunities for India. We then consider the U.S.-India relationship and how India is increasingly engaging with the rest of the world. Finally we look at opportunities for young Americans in India - over 4,000 come to study and intern in India each year.

Are you curious about how the mass-produced modern book emerged in the first place?  Come behind the scenes in Harvard’s libraries to explore the look, feel and even smell of nineteenth-century British and American books in this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain and America, schooling expanded, paper cheapened, and new technologies allowed print to reach wider audiences than ever before.  After the rare and beautiful manuscripts and books showcased by earlier modules, the mass-produced, disposable objects that survive from the nineteenth century bear witness to the rise of the reading public.\n\nThis module investigates what scholars know about nineteenth-century reading, as well as how they know it.\n\nThis module’s six sections guide you through underlined, inscribed, defaced and repaired books in Harvard’s collections:\n\n1. Name That Book\nFind out what you can tell about a book when you’re blindfolded.\n\n2. Handheld Books and Mobile Readers\nWhat book did one soldier carry to Civil War battlefields in his pocket? (Hint: it’s not what you think.)\n\n3. The Pen and the Needle\nDid 19th-century girls have to choose between sewing and reading?  The holes pricked in one book suggest they did both at once.\n\n4. Leaving your Mark\nLuckily for future historians, these children didn’t listen when people told them not to write in their books.\n\n5. Detective Work\nTry out some tools that build on what you’ve learned about books at Harvard to discover the stories hidden in your local library.\n\n6. Over to You\nYour chance to share what you have found in the books around you.\n\nJoin us, and discover how people in the first information age read, underlined, and repaired the pages that they treasured. \n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

What is your heritage? Who defines heritage? Why is heritage under threat? How can we protect heritage?   WW1, WW2, Cold war politics and contemporary conflicts as well as continuing political and socio-economic inequalities and colonial pasts are all factors playing a role in the global heritage discussions and approaches to (or lack of ) valorization and protection of heritage. Hence, issues behind destruction or threats to heritage are related to complex issues, often connected to complex landscapes of wars, the war-on-terror, fundamentalism, migration, global warming, financial crises, inequality and diverse interests of local communities.   This course, sponsored by the LDE Centre for Global Heritage and Development and the Honours Academy of Leiden University, and supported by UNESCO, will explore these issues.

Different ethnic and religious communities have coexisted throughout the centuries in the city, which has been the capital of Portugal since the XIIIth century. Many different peoples from all corners of the World have arrived to or departed from Lisbon. The echo of their knowledge, experiences and customs have long remained reflected in Portuguese history and culture. But Lisbon has also been a point of departure and a place of arrival for many Portuguese who for many reasons have crossed the seas and left their mark all over the world.

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Part.\nPart One focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. Please note that Part One was\npreviously named ‘A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New\nMethods, Part 1’.Part Two turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.Hao Dong co-teaches this course with Prof James Lee. Hao is a PhD candidate in Social Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Hong Kong PhD Fellowship recipient. His research compares East Asian and Western historical populations to study the influence of family, kin, and socioeconomic contexts on individuals. His publications include such learned journals as Social Science &amp; Medicine, Demography, and Historical Research.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 2 covers the following subjects:\nWho Are We\nWho Survives\nWho Reproduces\nWho Marries\nWho Cares\nConclusion\n                                    ",

In the process of acquiring basic language skills in German, you will be using them to construct personal or virtual profiles within the context of your own culture and society. At the same time, you will compare your cultural attitudes and Weltanschauung with those represented through the lives of contemporary German personalities, actors, artists and politicians.  \n\nDesigned for a multicultural and multilingual audience, this course takes a ground zero approach to your knowledge of German language, culture and society. However, this course will also offer opportunities for advanced students and native speakers to interact with each other and with course participants on topics related to e.g. hobbies, nutrition, professions and vacation. We will also be polling your attitudes towards issues in Germany related to the family, the environment and immigration. \n\nExpressing ourselves in German within the context of our cultural differences is an important focus of this course. To accomplish, this we will provide you with numerous models of spoken and written language usage accompanied by exercises that will prepare you for creating your own personal texts.  Throughout the course, you will receive both automated feedback during the online exercises and comments from the teaching team on the most frequent and reoccurring errors found in your essays and VoiceThreads. Moreover, we will give you links to online resources for extra grammar explanations and for practicing German pronunciation.We hope this course will pique your\ninterest in German language and culture and that you will continue to learn and\nuse the language as a means to communicate with each other worldwide after the\ncourse ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The weekly schedule for this six week course comprises daily\nassignments that guide you towards an understanding of German language and\nculture and to expressing yourself within the context of topics such as: \nFamilien und Beziehungen (Families and Relationships) \nHobbys und Interessen (Hobbies and Interests) \nErnährung und Wellness (Nutrition and Wellness) \nReisen und Urlaub (Travel and Vacation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ",

Secure Land Tenure and Property Rights (LTPR) create incentives for investment, broad-based economic growth, and good stewardship of natural resources. Insecure property rights and weak land governance systems often provoke conflict and instability, which can trap communities, countries, and entire regions in a cycle of poverty.Through 12 thematic modules and 3 country case studies, this course examines the issues, theories, evidence, and best practices around land tenure, property rights, and effective international development programming. This course features lectures and case studies from a wide variety of experts in the field – from leading academics to seasoned development practitioners.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nModule 1: Introduction to Land Tenure and Property Rights (Karol Boudreaux, The Cloudburst Group)\r\nModule 2: Land Tenure and Property Rights Concepts and Terms (Karol Boudreaux, The Cloudburst Group)\r\nModule 3A: Setting the Context – Tanzania (Yuliya Neyman, USAID)\r\nModule 3B: Land Tenure, Investment and Economic Growth (Malcolm Childress, Land Alliance)\r\nModule 4: Land Tenure, Food Security and Employment Policy Challenges (Thomas Jayne, Michigan State University)\r\nModule 5: Land Tenure, Climate Change and the Environment (Mark Freudenberger, Tetra Tech)\r\nModule 6: Land Tenure Focused Monitoring and Evaluation (Mercedes Stickler, USAID)\r\nModule 7A: Setting the Context – Colombia (Amy Regas, Tetra Tech)\r\nModule 7B: Land Tenure, Gender Equity, and Empowerment (Cheryl Doss, Yale University)\r\nModule 8: Land Tenure and Human Rights (Tiernan Mennen, Chemonics)\r\nModule 9: Land Tenure in Conflict-Affected Environments (Peter Van der Auweraert, International Organization for Migration)\r\nModule 10: Principles and Practices of Land Dispute Resolution and Peace Building (Maureen Lempke, Independent Consultant)\r\nModule 11A: Setting the Context – Haiti (Gabriela Vaz Rodriguez, Land Alliance)\r\nModule 11B: Land Tenure Issues and the Urban Environment (William Valletta, Independent Consultant)\r\nModule 12: Land Tenure, Post-Disaster Management &amp; Disaster Risk Reduction (Cynthia Caron, Clark University)\r\nModule 13: Land Tenure Administration Systems and Technology (Grenville Barnes, University of Florida)\r\nModule 14: Conclusion (Jolyne Sanjak, Land Alliance)\r\n\n                                    ",

Wherever we come from, the words we use and the way in which we use them are fundamental to our cultural identity. In today’s increasingly globalised world, however, ‘linguicide’ – the loss of a language – is becoming all too common. But there is hope. The language revival movement has emerged as an important and effective response, and this course will introduce you to its key principles and techniques.\n \nAfter discussing powerful answers to the question of why languages should be revived, we’ll investigate how. Far more than just a simple process of recovering literacy and lost letters, language revival involves a deep and complex engagement with history, human rights, identity and wellbeing. You will also learn what’s being done around the world right now, and how effective these techniques have been.\n\n                                    ",

Along with that, it illustrates the employed scheme and methodology of teaching in full view of the participants. As such, a sincere follower of this course will not only develop a good command over English in all its operational aspects, but also acquire the technique of teaching it to others.In order to achieve this with adult learners within a limited span of time, the scheme makes use of the medium of a so called Common Local Language (CLL) which is presumably familiar to its target audience. In this particular instance, Hindi has been taken as the CLL and the participants will be expected to have a basic operational aptitude in Hindi. [After collecting the feedback on this, partner groups will be sought to develop other versions of the course with Kannada, Tamil, Bengali etc as CLL on the basis of the same core material, which is independent of the medium language.]\n\n                                    ",

This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing written English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of cross-cultural interactions and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.\n\nThis course is part of a series developed by the same instructors.

What is easy and hard about learning another language? And what is the best way to teach other languages?\n\nThis free online course suggests some answers to these questions. It has been developed by the University of Southampton and the British Council, and draws on their exciting joint online course, MA in English Language Teaching.\n\nThe course takes place over four weeks. It will introduce you to some of the latest ideas in research and practice in language learning and teaching. We will:\n\n\n  Explore second language learning and what it means to learn language\n  Consider language classrooms and how teaching affects our language learning\n  Look at the use of technology in teaching, and its benefits and challenges for language learning.\n\n\nFinally, we will investigate the case of English – the most widely learnt and taught language in the world. How has English achieved this position? What are the implications of the spread of English for policy, teaching and other languages?\n\nThe course includes quizzes, activities, discussions and videos filmed around the world. The videos feature experts such as British Council teachers, and staff and students at the University of Southampton.\n\nDuring the course, you will hear different voices sharing their ideas and opinions – and we want to hear yours too. How do you use language in YOUR life? What is YOUR experience of language learning and teaching?

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.\n\nThis period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.\n\nThis course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last five weeks with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.\n\nPart 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi—who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision—and his former student Hanfeizi, a “Legalist” thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China’s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.\n\nSee also:\n\nChinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1\n\n                                    ",

They are instruments of communication and are often a source of dignity and of human pride. Our life experiences and views of the world are bound up in our languages. Our sense of self might be strengthened by our ability to speak the language we choose or curtailed by our inability to understand the language that speaks to us. Some scholars even say that the right to speak one’s languages should be established as an essential part of the right to be oneself. They suggest that this language right should be honoured in all forms of communication.\n\nIn this course, you will explore how people’s language practice, and the personal connection people have to the language(s) they speak, provoke important philosophical and pedagogical questions around the ways we form personal relationships, engage in business relations and even view the world around us.\n\nExplore how languages challenge the way we live\n\nEnglish is the language of worldwide communication. Should this change? Should people’s personal language practices influence the way we communicate on a global scale? How might the claim for people’s language rights challenge the language arrangements in our societies? What is gained and what is lost from speaking just one language?\n\nThese are just some of the questions you will consider and during the course; there will be plenty of opportunities for you to share your experiences, so we can learn from each other.\n\nIn summary, during the course you will:\n\n\n  be introduced to different multilingual environments, consider what these mean for learning languages, and encounter some of the latest research in researching for working multilingually;\n  experience and critically evaluate the idea of active citizenship, discovering ways in which language minorities can be empowered through the equal treatment of all languages and cultures;\n  deepen your understanding of other languages and cultures through consideration of language rights, existing educational films and workshops developed through their practices;\n  and address the ways in which the creative and performing arts can help translate meanings and enhance understandings in multilingual environments.\n\n\nYou can follow the team behind this course on Twitter – @UoGMultilingua.\n\n\n                                    ",

They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation.\n \nFrom Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions?\n \nLearn from Smithsonian and industry experts including:\n\nStan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\tMichael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman. \nIn this course, we explore the following questions:\n\nWhy did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II?\n\tWhy did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades?\n\tHow have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices? \n\tWhy was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s? \n\tHow did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century? \n\tWhen and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools? \n\tWhen and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz? \n\tFinally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe?\nFor the first time ever, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world.\n\nAs you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes. This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of the course is the intellectual property of you and you alone.  At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to take your final project work and participate with other current and alumni students in a two week “team track add-on\" to the course. \n\nAt last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course.\n\n                                    ",

We will examine the lives and legacies of food culture giants Henri Soulé, James Beard, Julia Child, Edna Lewis, and Marion Cunningham. Some are well-known to the public, others less so, but they all have left a long-lasting mark on what and where Americans eat, how they cook, and even the way they think and talk about food.\r\nEach unit focuses on one of the five innovators, drawing on panel discussions and interviews with food writers, researchers, and practitioners who knew them. Structured around notable figures we refer to as “culinary luminaries,” the course leans toward the past. This is not because we intend to create a canon establishing the most important contributors to the development of the food world in the U.S. Much research is developing in the field of culinary arts, which is emerging as a field worthy of attention not only from journalists and practitioners, but from authors and scholars. We could not fully understand the contributions of our five innovators without looking at the social and cultural contexts of their work. The video material dedicated to each of the five innovators will delve into these topics, shedding light on distinctive aspects of the U.S. food world at different points in time.\r\nHenri Soulé, James Beard, Julia Child, Edna Lewis, and Marion Cunningham worked in fields ranging from media to catering, and from restaurants to publishing. Their diverse contributions hint at the complex dynamics that lead to the evolution of the food world, a world influenced by food producers, restaurateurs, marketers, opinion makers, food writers, and book editors, to mention just a few.\r\nWhy does the course focus on past innovators, rather than contemporary trends? Today’s culinary world is so dominated by the media and their news cycles that we tend to live in a compressed present, always looking for the next hot thing and creating celebrities to fuel the self-perpetuation of the industry. We seldom take the time to pause and look back. How did we get here? Was it always like this? America’s relationship with food is particularly interesting because many feel that until the late 1950s the high-end culinary world of the U.S. lived as a reflection of French haute cuisine and its approach to restaurants. What happened in that period that generated radical changes in the way Americans eat out and think of what constitutes good food?\r\nWe do not intend to set U.S. culinary arts as a model. Through the close examination of the American experience and the contributions of innovators to its gastronomy, we want to help you acquire critical tools you can adapt and use to explore your own food culture, wherever you are. This is an open and burgeoning field with much to observe and learn about. We hope this course will be only the first step in your own research.\n\n                                    ",

Why emerging countries consider cultural values as instrumental in their quest for modernization? How can art contribute to a country’s public image?\r\nThese are central questions in an increasingly globalized world. Through a case study on global culture, this online course on the first ever award for contemporary art in China named CCAA aims to address these questions and identify some possible answers.\r\nWhile working through six chapters, you will receive exclusive reading material, supplementary videos and background information about the developments in the Chinese art scene of the last 40 years, the Chinese Contemporary Art Award established by Mr Uli Sigg as well as the Sigg Collection as part of the newly created museum M+ in Hong Kong. Moreover, you get insights into contemporary Chinese art, first-hand information about the art scene in China, and a wide range of contacts with relevant local and international institutions and actors.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1 - Chinese contemporary art in the context of cultural globalization Chapter 1 gives you an insight into the complexity of how cultural globalization can be approached in form of a case study and why the example of China is appropriate to study these questions.\r\n2 - Bringing up China – Uli Sigg, his collection and its internationalization Chapter 2 «Bringing up China» leads to discussions on how culture can be understood as a tool in order to understand foreign societies and how Mr Sigg strategically approached China’s art scene.\r\n3 - The west discovers contemporary Chinese Art — and so does China Chapter 3 investigates how art can contribute to a country’s public image and how this has been used by different actors to promote a certain impression of Chinese society and cultural production.\r\n4 - The Story of the Unknown Artist. From mapping the art scene to promoting excellency. Chapter 4 broaches the subject on how the CCAA’s approach on promoting artists has changed over the years and why the model of the «unknown artist» is introduced to trace these changes.\r\n5 - Locating the CCAA – From letter-box company to multi-purpose centre Chapter 5 traces back the adaptations of the art prize and its institutional representation over the last 15 years. The learners find out about the enormous shifts in Chinese society, politics and also the art scene.\r\n6 - 15 Years CCAA – Whom does Chinese contemporary art belong to? Chapter 6 aims to discuss the question of independence in art on the occasion of the CCAA’s first encounter with government censorship during the 15-year anniversary show in Shanghai. Finally, the massive museum project M+ is presented.\n                                    ",

Do you want to know how to make your community more inclusive? Are you interested in linguistic studies? In this free online course, you will learn the basics of Catalan Sign Language (LSC), the sign language used by the deaf community in Catalonia, and a valuable research area for sign language linguists.\n\nLearn basic Catalan Sign Language\n\nDuring the course, you will practice a lot of “finger gymnastics”. By the end of the course, you will understand common signs and expressions, signed slowly and clearly, that relate to yourself, family life and work, and the immediate environment.\n\nYou will also be able to express yourself in simple terms, ask simple questions about everyday topics, and use expressions and simple phrases to describe well-known places. Finally, you will be able to sign short texts such as a story.\n\nExplore Catalan Sign Language as a natural language of the deaf community\n\nYou will learn about the wider significance of Catalan Sign Language and about the importance of the deaf community having their own language.\n\nAlthough Catalan Sign Language is recognised officially in Catalonia, often the deaf community can seem isolated. By learning about sign language, and the reality of the deaf community, both the hearing and the deaf can put an end to social exclusion.\n\nCatalan Sign Language as an object of linguistic study\n\nWith interest consistently increasing in linguistics and sign language being a compelling area of study, Catalan Sign Language is a valuable research area for the world’s (sign language) linguists.\n\nDuring the course you will examine a variety of Catalan Sign Language characteristics, including basic components of grammar such hand configuration, place of articulation, and movement; morphology, such as concordance and expression of plural; and finally basic syntax, such as word order.\n\n\n                                    ",

People are increasingly bombarded by dramatic and at times disturbing headlines. Yet general knowledge of Muslims and their faith can be poor. There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic.\n\nThis course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade.  This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities.  Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested\n\nTopics include:\n\nIslamic Practice An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam.\n\nHistory of Islam in Britain An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed.\n\nSettlement Patterns The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities.\n\nCultural Diversity Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today.\n\nContemporary Debates An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold.\n\nGiven current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.\n\nThe course will also include an exciting opportunity to join us live via web streaming for the IslamUK Centre’s Public Lecture Series each week as a series of leading scholars address key topics in depth.\n\nTo find out more, read Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “Muslims in Britain: exploring diversity and challenging stereotypes.”\n\n\n                                    ",

As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications.

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.\n\nThis period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.\n\nThis course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last 5 weeks, with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.\n\nPart 1 introduces the basic philosophical, religious and scientific concepts that will be drawn upon throughout the course, and then goes on to cover early Shang and Zhou religious thought, the Analects of Confucius, the Daodejing (a Daoist text attributed to Laozi), the utilitarian thinker Mozi, the newly discovered and very exciting Guodian texts, and the momentous philosophical changes that occurred in the mid Warring States period.\n\n \n\nSee also:\n\nChinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2\n\n                                    ",

Our main aim in this course is to consider and create new narratives about how humans and the environment relate to one another.\n\nWe’ll begin this course by identifying historical ways of thinking about the environment. Through a range of examples, we’ll illustrate how “nature” is a human invention. We’ll then look at how the role of humans has been conceptualised in opposition to notions of nature, and assert that we were never at the centre, nor in control of the environment.\n\nHaving questioned these common “modernist” conceptions about nature, we’ll examine some of the ways in which the natural world is being “remade,” both discursively (in the way we write, speak and think about it) and materially (for instance, in the alteration of DNA and the wholesale transformation of ecosystems).\n\nFinally, we’ll ask you to join us in creating new narratives about nature that demonstrate greater care and concern.\n\nExplore research methods and real-world environmental concerns\n\nLeading experts from the Environmental Humanities programme at UNSW Australia’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences will introduce you to their research in this innovative and interdisciplinary field.\n\nBy the end of this course you will:\n\nunderstand why the Environmental Humanities is critical to environmental problem-solving in this age of global environmental crisis;\nhave a clear idea of a range of research methods in the Environmental Humanities;\nbe aware of opportunities and challenges in this area, and how these relate to global environmental concerns;\nand develop experience in using storytelling to envision new environmental paradigms and ways forward.\n\n\n\n\n                                    ",

The Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts and Mathematics, the Next Generation Science Standards, and new English Language Proficiency Standards all include a focus on argumentation, requiring that students construct claims supported by evidence and/or reasoning. In this course, we will explore how formative assessment practices can be targeted in improve student argumentation skills, an essential, cross-disciplinary practice.Participants in this course will use a range of practical tools for gathering and analyzing language samples that show how students currently construct claims supported by evidence and/or reasoning, as well as identifying next steps in students' development. These tools support formative assessment and instructional planning. Focal topics include: articulating claims; linking evidence and/or reasoning to claims; and evaluating evidence and/or reasoning. We will also explore similarities and differences in argumentation across content areas and grade levels.

English as a Second Language; English as a New Language, \"Designated ELD,\" Focused Language Study) takes a variety of forms in present-day schools. In many schools, teachers teach ELD for a set amount of time (e.g., 30 minutes) a day. Other ELD/ESL teachers have multiple classes each day. In many cases, teachers emphasize grammar and vocabulary. However, the grammar and vocabulary route isn't the most effective for lasting and engaging language learning.. Language was created to get things done, to communicate—and this is how students best learn it. This is where this MOOC starts. It focuses on how to design and teach activities that are saturated with communication, and, where needed, strategically develop grammar and vocabulary to support communication.Each session presents the focal area to work on for the following month (e.g., listening and watching, reading and viewing, writing/multimedia output, speaking, writing, and conversation), along with model activities and lessons that emphasize the focus, analyses of the models and non-models, lessons to be strengthened by participants, and a sample \"expert\" modifications of lessons. Whenever possible, we include samples of activities from two levels: beginning and intermediate.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1 – Course Overview &amp; Communication-Focused Listening &amp; Watching (October 1 - October 21)Session 2 – Communication-Focused Reading &amp; Viewing (October 21 - November 11)Session 3 – Communication-Focused Speaking (November 12 - December 9)Session 4 – Communication-Focused Writing (December 10 - December 28)Session 5 – Communication-Focused Conversations (December 29 - January 20)\n                                    ",

The purpose of the course is to support teachers to enhance students' language development by analyzing complex texts and using language from those texts, the major practices emphasized in the current college- and career-ready standards. The course will have 4 different sessions addressing the following: 1) what makes a text complex; 2) effective strategies for teaching students to analyze textual features; 3) effective strategies for teaching students to use and acquire textual language; and 4) designing lessons that emphasize students using textual language and analyzing textual features.Throughout the course, participants will complete 4 assignments that require them to collect samples of student language as it relates to the analysis and discussion of complex texts. It also organizes a massive collaboration of educators who wish to support students, particularly English Language Learners, in developing their abilities to use complex language.We hope you will join us on this exciting journey.\n\n                                    ",

We will look at the ways in which the extraordinary family histories of Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un and Park Geun-hye embody the complex relationship between lips and teeth.\n\nPainting on a broad historical canvas, we will learn why Chinese and Koreans have insisted on remaining as close as “lips and teeth,” and yet how difficult that ideal is to achieve in reality.\n\nThe educator for this course is John Delury, Professor of Chinese history and Sino-Korean relations at Yonsei University, and co-author of the acclaimed book, “Wealth &amp; Power: China’s Long March to the 21st Century.”\n\nYou can find out more in John’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “Lips and teeth: weaving the ‘tangled skein’ of Korea and China’s history.”\n\n\n                                    ",

In Chinese history documents, this region was called “Nan Yang” or “Nan Hai”. From the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Indian culture, Chinese culture, Islamic culture and Western culture have moved into this area. After a long process of localization, external culture and the native culture were fully fused, forming a unique cultural expression and cultural characteristics.\nIn 1967, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia issued \"Bangkok Declaration\" to declare the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established. After the 1980s, Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999) has joined the ASEAN, so that this organization covering the entire Southeast Asian region.\nAs the geographical neighbor of China, the Southeast Asian region plays \"top\" role in China's foreign relations. With the gradual deepening of exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, misunderstanding of cultures caused some problems. In order to improve the understanding of Chinese people about the neighbor countries, this course will show the development steps of Southeast Asian culture, and explain the traditional and modern culture features of Southeast Asia through the specific cultural phenomenons.\n\n教学参考书有哪些?\n\n吴虚领：《东南亚美术 》，中国人民大学出版社，2004年。 贺圣达：《东南亚文化发展史》，云南人民出版社，2010年。 （新西兰）尼古拉斯•塔林《剑桥东南亚史》，王士录等译，云南人民出版社，2012年。 梁志明等：《东南亚古代史》，北京大学出版社，2013年\n\n授课形式是什么样的？\n\n本课程主要包括由讲课视频、参考教材阅读、作业、在线讨论、期末考试组成。每周的讲课视频有3-5段不等，每一段的时长在10分钟左右。每一周有一次课后作业。 教学团队鼓励修读者互帮互助，主动解答线上提出的问题。\n\n本课程的评分方法？\n\n 本课程的成绩评定主要由以下4个部分组成：\n\n单元测验（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一次测验，包括10道客观选择题。同学们需要在课程结束1周内完成测验。\n\t单元作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个讨论题作为书面作业。同学们需要在课程结束1周内容完成。\n\t互评作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个互评作业，每个同学需要评价至少5份作业。同学们需要在课程结束2周内容完成。\n\t期末考试（占总成绩40%） 由40道客观选择题组成。考试时间2小时。\nReading Materials\n\nWu Xuling, Art of Southeast, Remin University Press, 2004.\n\tHe Shengda, A Cultural History of Southeast Asia, Yunan People’s Publishing House, 2010.\n\tNicholas Tarling, ed., The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia, Wang Shilu, trans., Yunan People’s Publishing House, 2012.\n\tLiang Zhiming, A History of Ancient History, Peking University Press, 2013.\nCourse format\n\nThis course consists lecture videos, reading materials, assignments, discussion and final exams.

En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián entre el centeno», españolas.\nLas Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones que ha merecido el curso.\n\nEn este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones de G. V. Higgins; y por las variedades peninsular y argentina o americana de la lengua española en las diferentes versiones de J.D. Salinger.\n\nLa finalidad del curso es doble. \nAnte un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. \n\nFinalizar este curso le permitirá: \n1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores españoles. \n2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), \n3. Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto», versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana, o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’, desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua. \n\nNo es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de algunas manifestaciones de la variedad argentina y española de lengua.\n\n                                    ",

Sustainability is often explained as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising\n    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” In practice, this means understanding connections, including connections across time. These connections create systems that are greater than the simple sums of their parts, with consequences\n    that are often unexpected by people paying attention to only one part of a system. This course provides an introduction to the ideas and practices that people are using to understand and change these connections in pursuing more sustainable processes,\n    communities, environments, and organizations. \n\nSystems theory appears in many guises and most disciplines claim some share of the systems approach to connections and consequences. In ways that we will explore in the course, design thinking is a method for putting systems theory into practice. Designers\n    and their way of thinking provide a significant contribution to sustainability in practice, from improving energy performance in buildings to identifying the value ecosystems services provide to human settlements. This course has several strategic\n    partners providing us with content and with platforms for discussion. These networks will provide the course with an extensive and diverse portfolio of problems, solutions, illustrations, and challenges with which to explore the ideas presented above.\n    We will use these very different venues as platforms for discussion and will organize student conversations and assignments using the network partners.     \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\nCONNECTIONS  What is sustainability? Links between sustainability and earlier ideas. Who does it, why, and how? Examples of how sustainability is used as by governments and enterprises. What is a system? Illustrations of parts, linkages, feedbacks,\n    and leverage points. What is design thinking?   \n    \n\n\nWeek 2:\nACCOUNTING What is an efficient allocation of resources? What are the consequences of mis-allocating resources? Examples of externalities, commons problems, and cognitive bias. Discussion of lifecycle costs, behavioral influence, and aligning incentives.\nWeek 3:\nRESILIENCE What is the relationship between mitigation of and adaptation to challenges to sustainability? What makes a system more and less resilient? How are people making cities and companies and landscapes more resilient in the face of challenges\n    such as sea-level rise or energy scarcity or food security?  \n\n\nWeek 4:\nEMERGENCE Resource efficiency and system integrity seek to balance flows over time. What is emergence? How does design thinking generate productive emergence and what strategies exist for anticipating and responding to emergent threats?\n    \n\n\nWeek 5:\nJURISDICTION Who decides when resources have been accounted for, if a system is resilient enough, or whether an emerging trend is a threat or opportunity? At what scale and over what questions will such decisions be made?\n    \n\n\nWeek 6:\nPERFORMANCE Even once sustainable outcomes are legitimized into goals and decided on through commitments, how are these outcomes achieved? How would we know? Discussion of competitions and incentives, measurement and management, and new methods of\n    regulating performance and compliance.\n    \n\n\nWeek 7:\nDISRUPTION How are existing roles and professions being disrupted by the demands of sustainability? Discussion of big data, simplifying system complexity, and the adaptation of legacy assets to new purposes.\n    \n\n\nWeek 8:\nCONNECTIONS Summary of discussions and of emerging questions.

L'apprendimento delle dinamiche interne ed esterne alle organizzazioni sarà sempre affiancato da casi di studio ed esempi presi dal mondo dei beni culturali, in particolare ci saranno approfondimenti teorici e pratici sui processi di progettazione organizzativa e i criteri che sono alla base delle scelta della forma organizzativa.\n\n                                    ",

Successivamente, si presenteranno una serie di casi di successo di storie di innovazione spontanea e necessaria che hanno portato alla rinascita del patrimonio dimenticato in particolare nella dimensione minore del Sud Italia, soffermandoci in particolare sul fenomeno dell’innovazione sociale e sulla sua applicabilità al patrimonio culturale.\r\nLearning Objectives:In questo MOOC illustreremo una serie di storie emblematiche che in questi anni si sono sviluppate nell’Italia del Sud, e che hanno provato con un approccio innovativo ad affrontare la problematica della tutela del patrimonio culturale ed ambientale. Si tratta di casi esemplari di progetti nati senza un supporto istituzionale utili però ad esplorare un fenomeno di crescente interesse che mostra evidenti interventi di innovazione sociale dal basso.  Sulla base di queste esperienze saranno descritte le caratteristiche di un nuovo modello di gestione del patrimonio culturale ed ambientale che viene innescato proprio dalla partecipazione dei cittadini e che si ispira al concetto di Social innovation.Al termine del corso si avranno gli strumenti per: diagnosticare i problemi e le sfide provenienti dal contesto culturale; sviluppare e applicare modelli di sviluppo partecipativi; impiegare metodi e processi interdisciplinari.Lo studio dei casi, inoltre, consentirà, attraverso l’impatto con esperienze reali, l’apprendimento di nozioni per lo sviluppo della capacità di costruire relazioni, coalizioni e sistemi per supportare e sostenere il cambiamento.\n\n                                    ",

The environment is directly impacted by pollution and explosions; and can be used as a weapon of war through scorched earth military action, poisoning and defoliation. In the longer term, sustainable environmental management is disrupted when conflict destabilises social systems and people are denied access to natural resources.\n\nWe will explore how we have utilised the environment of the planet to the point where there are fundamental changes to its biogeochemical cycles. For example: climate change from greenhouse gas emissions; acidification of oceans; and soil erosion.  As resources become scarcer, it might be expected that people come into conflict about access to natural resources.\n\nIntrigued?  Then sign up for this short course to find out more.\n\nEarn credit from the University of Leeds\n\nThis course is part of the Environmental Challenges program from the University of Leeds. When you complete all five courses in the program and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will be eligible to join a final assessment course that leads to the award of 10 credits from the University of Leeds.\n\nGain a key environmental management skill\n\nEach course in the program includes an exercise and revision material to help you develop a skill that is key to working in environmental management – this course explores how to resolve conflict and negotiate.\n\nChoose how you would like to learn\n\n\n  \n    If you have a general interest in this topic, you can work through the activities in around three hours each week. You will have the opportunity to check your understanding and spend some time joining the discussions.\n  \n  \n    If you would like to know more about the topic, you can spend up to an extra two hours a week reading the additional materials and watching the videos provided in the ‘Downloads’ and ‘See also’ sections within some course steps. By doing this, you will have the required knowledge to attempt the end of course test.\n  \n  \n    If you have more time to study, you can also complete the optional revision activity and join a live Q&amp;A session in the second week of the course – this will help you when you attempt the end of course test. You will need to allow a further two hours a week to cover the revision tasks.\n  \n\n\n\n                                    ",

Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.\nAunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.\nEsta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.\nLa acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.\nEn nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor.\n\nAdentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura.\n\tOfrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él.\n\tComparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana. \n\nEn el tiempo de El Quijote las luces de los genios literarios y artísticos brillaron sobre las sombras de la Inquisición. Viajemos, pues, a esta excelsa cultura del Siglo de Oro.\n\n                                    ",

The lectures revolve around social dimensions of change, the continuing influence of ancient texts on contemporary India, political democracy, economic transition from the state to the market, gender relations, India's economic globalisation and changing world view.\n\nWhile one of the objectives is to capture the multifaceted process of change, the course also critically examines some of the tensions inherent in these changes. For example, how does gender inequality play itself out in a changing Indian society, how do the modernist conceptions of art entailing market valuation challenge the more socio-centric values found in South India, what are the politics linguistic identities, and how might India address its myriad development challenges such as poverty and unemployment.\n\nNo specific prior knowledge is required. However, it would be helpful if students are aware of the socio political dynamics at play in contemporary India and keep themselves abreast with current affairs and debates in the country to fully appreciate the various dimensions and contours if the subject matter in the course.\n\nThis course is taught in English.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Contemporary India's historyWe begin this course by discussing the history of pre-partition India i.e. before 1947. We will trace the trajectory of British rule from its inception in India and discuss important events like the mutiny of 1857, the formation of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, the divide and rule policy of the British, the idea of separate electorates and how it paved the way for partition in the subcontinent. You will be able to appreciate the devastation that partition brought to the region with millions of people killed, displaced and made refugees overnight. We will try to impress upon the fact that such a momentous event in world history, which involved ethnic cleansing in huge numbers, has been almost forgotten or is not remembered often enough; nor are the lessons learnt. The week concludes by discussing how partition still continues to affect community relations, relations between states and the very foundational ideas of the two nations: India and Pakistan.Indian politics 1948-2014This week we will cover the post-independence politics of India from 1948 to 2014. It will discuss the various leaders especially the contribution of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to Indian polity. You will get an idea about how India went about its task of nation building and the various challenges it confronted along the way. The section will also cover the dominance of the Congress party and the factors that led to its downfall in recent times. The debates about linguistic states, affirmative action, secularism and the changing nature of Indian federalism will be discussed. You should be able to appreciate the reasons as to why, even with all its shortcomings, India remains an exemplar of robust democracy unlike most other post-colonial countries.The long transition of India's economyThis section will look at the trajectory of India's economic development. It has changed from a state-led economic development model to the one where through a series of a reforms the economy has become more pro-business and market-friendly. You will be introduced to the basic features of first and second-generation reforms, the transformation of the economy since India liberalized in 1991 and the challenges of poverty and job creation that still needs to be tackled.India's foreign policyAs India's influence increases in the international system, understanding its foreign policy and its engagement with the rest of the world is critical for students of international relations. This section is designed as a comprehensive review of some of the key issues related to India's word view and its behaviour towards the external world. Apart from taking stock of contemporary thinking and policies of the country, the major thrust would be on India's relations with its neighbours and great powers, its nuclear weapons policy and the ideological foundations of its foreign policy after independence.\nWomen, gender and feminist struggles in IndiaThis week you will be introduced to some of the concerns related to women and the politics of gender in contemporary India. The section will also focus on some of the key issues related to feminist struggle over the last three decades. Not only will it touch upon the achievements of these struggles but also deal with issues related to missing women, low sex-ratio of women compared to men in India, violence against women, the demand for representation in legislative bodes and the struggle for the rights of sexual minorities. The theme of gender justice and how it is articulated in various forums will also form an important part of this section.\nThe Ramayan\tThis week we will discuss one of India's ancient epics - The Ramayana. Here you will not just be introduced to the text but the various Ramayana traditions, which include a wide range of performance traditions, be it in folk theatre, women's Ramayana songs or shadow puppetry. At the core of these traditions is the idea of morality or dharma, which continues to find resonance in contemporary India even though it was written around 500BC. Because there are innumerable interpretations of the Ramayana, often the sacred becomes the source of controversy. But these disagreements often reinforce the relevance of the epic in the daily lives of Indian society.The past in the present: traditional art forms in today's India\tWe will use arts as a lens to look at some of the general transformations in today’s India. The focus in this section will be to negate the modernity/tradition dichotomy and instead argue that traditions in India are constantly changing. These traditions adapt to the prevailing conditions, which present its own complexities. To understand them, specific concepts and tools will be introduced to better explain the realities of contemporary India, which simultaneously remains connected to its ancient past.\n                                    ",

Sie müssen keine formale Ausbildung als Lehrer haben – Sie brauchen nur etwas freie Zeit, Geduld und die Bereitschaft, mit den Asylsuchenden in Ihrem Umfeld in Kontakt zu treten.\r\nIn diesem Kurs stellen Ihnen ehrenamtliche Deutschlehrer ihre Aktivitäten vor. Es werden einige wichtige Methoden vorgestellt, die Ihnen bei der Unterrichtsvorbereitung und Durchführung helfen.

What a great way to learn authentic conversational Italian!\n\tDownloadable Podcasts: become a participant in each Ciak! video and practice Italian when and where you want on your portable device!\n\tGrammar charts, with or without audio files: study and review grammar through concise, clear and downloadable pdf files, and practice pronunciation with our embedded audio files.\n\tShort video lessons: as if in a real classroom, learn each new topic with the instructor’s direct guidance.\n\tVideo interviews: learn from various native speakers as they talk about different aspects of Italian culture.\n\tShort “Letture” (readings): practice reading comprehension while learning about Italian culture.\n\tDiscussion board: your chance to communicate (in Italian!) with other students on a variety of suggested topics.\n\tReady to test your skills? Practice and review with a variety of self-correcting activities.\nItalian culture is an integral part of this course. Through our interviews and readings you will learn about:\n\nthe origins of the “made in Italy” in fashion;\n\tItalian Renaissance and Baroque art and poetry;\n\tthe Italian health care system;\n\tshopping for clothes and food in Italy.\nWhether you are a traditional, visual or auditory learner, you will find the tools that best fit your unique way to learn a foreign language.\n\nThis course has been successfully taught in different settings to more than 1,000 students: entirely online to Wellesley College alumnae and students, and as a mix of face-to-face and online instruction at Wellesley College and MIT. We are now proud to open it on edX, confident that your learning experience with this unique online course will be as enriching as it was for the many students who have already taken it.\n\nAfter completing this course, continue learning Italian with Italian Language and Culture: Advanced.\n\nFinally … buon lavoro e buon divertimento! \n\n“This course is really excellent, beautifully thought out. The grammar and the opportunity to repeat the contents of a lesson using different modalities really helps solidify the learning.” – Previous Student\n\n                                    ",

This course will introduce you to the basic language you will need to eat, live, and get around in Mandarin speaking countries.\n\nSince this is a language course, we recommend taking this course with a friend or group of friends. Practicing with others by speaking the language will help you learn it more effectively. Additionally, Mandarin is a tonal language, which means that in order to truly master it, you will need to say the words out loud!

En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián entre el centeno», españolas.\nLas Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones que ha merecido el curso.\n\nEn este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones de G. V. Higgins; y por las variedades peninsular y argentina o americana de la lengua española en las diferentes versiones de J.D. Salinger.\n\nLa finalidad del curso es doble. \nAnte un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. \n\nFinalizar este curso le permitirá: \n1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores españoles. \n2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), \n3. Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto», versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana, o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’, desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua. \n\nNo es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de algunas manifestaciones de la variedad argentina y española de lengua.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Algunas dudas y dificultades de expresiónEn este módulo nos centraremos en problemas encontrados comúnmente en el Españo actual.

Rey (1998): el uso actual de «uno/tú» con sentido arbitrario, los contrastes de léxico y otros aspectos de solución diferente en las versiones de la variedad argentina y de la variedad peninsular de la lengua española, como manifestación de las variaciones de lengua, perfectamente legítimas.\n                                    ",

You will develop skills in dealing with statistics, numbers and how to figure out if you have enough information to compile an effective news report.Preparing your news reportSometimes one of the biggest challenges in being a journalist is figuring out how to best handle quotes, format, and audience recognition. Knowing what you're reporting, and your audience, makes all the difference. You will learn how to best use and structure quotes in your news reports, choose the right format for reporting, and understand the needs of your audience.More than wordsHaving an effective news report is often dictated by the many thoughtful choices made by editors and journalists. How things look, sound, feel and read impacts how the audiences choose to take in information - and if they want to interact with your media. What are the things you need to consider? You will learn how your news report can be strengthened through multimedia: audio, video, graphics, photos and maps. You will develop skills in shooting video and photos, as well as gathering audio.Keeping the news conversation goingBeing a journalist does not mean you complete a news report...and move on to another story. Many times, one report leads to another, then another, then another on a particular topic. You will learn how to harness and understand the power of your audience, and use their feedback to develop more news reports. You will also deepen your understanding of audience reaction and how to handle the feedback.\n                                    ",

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo Lectures: 2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity and Signs \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures: 5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans. (Chicago)\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 3, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore , trans. (Chicago)\n• Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, M. L. West, trans. (Oxford)\n• Homeric Hymns, Sarah Ruden, trans. (Hackett)\n• Homer, The Odyssey, Robert Fagles, trans. (Penguin) \n• Virgil, The Aeneid, Robert Fitzgerald, trans. (Vintage)\n• Ovid, Metamorphoses, David Raeburn, trans. (Penguin)\n\nThese translations are a pleasure to work with, whereas many of the translations freely available on the internet are not. If you do not want to purchase them, they should also be available at many libraries. Again, these texts are not required, but they are helpful.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology!

In this course, you will develop skills for looking at art through a thematic lens. You will explore four themes–Places &amp; Spaces, Art &amp; Identity, Transforming Everyday Objects, and Art &amp; Society–while learning about artworks from The Museum of Modern Art's collection.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introduction to Modern Art &amp; IdeasWelcome to Modern Art &amp; Ideas. In this course, you will develop skills for looking at art through a thematic lens. Themes can provide a structure and pedagogical framework for engaging students with many different subjects, including art. You can look at works of art through a variety of themes, but in this course, you will explore four that educators frequently use when teaching at The Museum of Modern Art: Places &amp; Spaces, Art &amp; Identity, Transforming Everyday Objects, and Art &amp; Society.\n \nThis course includes a series of videos that connect works of art from MoMA’s collection and offer teaching strategies for looking at art with your students. You will also have access to a wide range of resources, readings, and activities. Don’t forget to post in the discussion forums to participate in conversations and activities with your peers. \nModule 2: Places &amp; SpacesIn this module, you will discover some of the different ways that artists represent place and use materials from their environment. This is an approachable theme for students as it’s something they are surrounded by everyday. Learn about The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh, Broadway Boogie Woogie by Piet Mondrian, Bingo by Gordon Matta-Clark, and Christina’s World by Andrew Wyeth. After watching the videos, be sure to read the articles, post in the discussion forums, and explore the additional resources.Module 3: Art &amp; IdentityIn this module, you will explore how artists make work to express, explore, and question ideas about identity. Although identity is a complex topic, it’s one that resonates with students. You will find tools and tips on how to best approach this theme with students of various ages. Learn about Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair by Frida Kahlo, Gold Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol, Runaways by Glenn Ligon, and Girl before a Mirror by Pablo Picasso. After watching the videos, be sure to read the articles, post in the discussion forums, and explore the additional resources.Module 4: Transforming Everyday ObjectsMany artists use or combine everyday objects—from beds to bicycle wheels to tea cups—challenging assumptions about what constitutes art and how it should be made. Designers develop utilitarian objects considering form, function, and use. This theme will introduce students to ideas about artistic and design choices, and the creative act of transforming everyday objects. Learn about Bicycle Wheel by Marcel Duchamp, Object by Meret Oppenheim, Bed by Robert Rauschenberg, and the Bic Cristal ballpoint pen. After watching the videos, be sure to read the articles, post in the discussion forums, and explore the additional resources.Module 5: Art &amp; SocietyMany artists create work in response to the social, cultural, and political issues of their time. This theme allows students to gain a deeper understanding of history and contemporary society, and encourages them to think critically about world events and how they are depicted. Learn about Untitled (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzales-Torres, Migrant Mother by Dorothea Lange, House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home by Martha Rosler, and the Migration Series by Jacob Lawrence. After watching the videos, be sure to read the articles, post in the discussion forums, and explore the additional resources for this module. \n\nNow that you have completed the four modules, you are ready for your final project.\n\n                                    ",

What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists such as Elizabeth Anderson, Isaiah Berlin, Thomas Christiano, Frantz Fanon, Amy Gutmann, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere, Ayn Rand, John Rawls, Peter Singer, and Kok-Chor Tan. \n\nThe aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: Introduction to Part I of the CourseAn introduction to Part I of the course and to some of the fundamental problems in legal and political philosophy.

You will develop an understanding of the core ideas that federalism and decentralization rest on, and study the building blocks that make them both work. Following a general overview of both federalism and decentralization, we will examine a number of case-studies from Africa where federalism and decentralization have been changing the continent’s political landscape in the last twenty years, coinciding with unprecedented levels of economic growth. \n\nWhat is federalism and how is it different from decentralization? What are the core ideas behind these concepts? Do federalism and decentralization enhance democracy, governance and diversity? Is that why virtually all countries south of the Sahara are now either federal or decentralized? We will be looking at Africa's track-record in order to answer these questions.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have acquired a general knowledge of federalism/decentralization and additional empirical knowledge of a number of African cases.  Upon completion you will also acquire the ability to unpack and understand a variety of potential consequences of federalism/decentralization reforms in the developing world.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome! The Three Promises of Federalism and DecentralizationWelcome to this course. In this first module you can find the introduction video and an exploration of the three promises of Federalism and Decentralization. Please join us in the Discussion Forums and do not forget to check our Academic Guidelines and the Precourse Survey.Core Ideas in Federalism and DecentralizationThis module will cover important concepts such as shared-rule and self-rule, autonomy, multiple identities and distributed authority. Don't forget to keep up with the readings for optimal understanding and application of this week's material! Do you have any questions, statements, remarks or other points you would like to discuss? Do not hesitate to post them in the Discussion Forums and a staff member or other course participants will be able to help you out!The Building Blocks of Federalism and DecentralizationIn this module we will discuss the various legal, political, and social foundations of federalism and decentralization. As you can see, this topic requires a true interdisciplinary perspective!Federalism in Post-Conflict Societies In previous modules, you've learned the theory behind federalism and decentralization, as well as the most important concepts and building blocks, This module, we will look at three case studies to acquire insight into how federalism and decentralization work in practice: Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia.Decentralization, Democracy and Economic DevelopmentWhile previous modules focused on federalism, Module 5 is all about decentralization! We will analyze the related but different dynamics decentralization presents. In particular, we will focus on the economic implications of decentralization on Africa. We will cover various perspectives that highlight state capacity, international factors, design of decentralized institutions, unintended long-term consequences, and uncodified home-grown practices of local governance. Critical Issues in Federalism and DecentralizationThe description goes herehis module will cover Critical Issues in Federalism and Decentralization, and will bring the knowledge and insights from previous modules tohether. The notion of state capacity will be unpacked into political, administrative, infrastructural, and economic components. We will also evaluate the relative importance of international know-how and local traditions.

Video lectures will be in Korean, with English subtitles. Discussions, quizzes, and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall.\n\nThe course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics.\n\nThe central content of the course is organized into two modules. First, it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: 史記), Plutarch's Lives, and History of the Three Kingdoms (한국어: 삼국사기; Chinese: 三國史記) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity, conflict and cooperation among political entities, development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity, and leadership selection in an entity.\n\nThe second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012, the arms race between the two Koreas, the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea, and upcoming political events.\n\nCourse videos are presented in Korean with English subtitles.\n\nThe main course image is copyright © 2013 Seoul National University News.\n\n                                    ",

It is designed to help participants develop skills to analyze policy proposals and advocate for their preferred options for issues on the public policy agenda ahead. The class assumes basic knowledge about governing institutions and democratic processes, while recommending supplemental materials for further study to complement reading links provided. The course focuses on future policy challenges, while examining the broad historical context in which policies are adopted and implemented.\n\nAs the course evaluates how issues are advanced by private sector interests, non-governmental organizations, and government policymakers, it examines how groups become effective policy advocates. Particular attention is paid to how winning coalitions are formed and how issue framing shapes the outcome of policy campaigns. The goal is neither to produce partisan talking points, nor to favor one governance philosophy over others. Rather it is to clarify the public policy challenges ahead and to enhance participants’ understanding of how policy options are adopted in the real world arena of contemporary politics.\n\nComing soon, you will be able to join Signature Track, a system that verifies your identity when you take an exam.

It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 – China and the World.\n\nPlease note that this course currently does not offer certificate.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Orientation and Module 1Before you start with the content for Module 1, please watch the Course Overview, review the Assignments and Grading page, and provide us with some information through the Pre-course Survey.By the end of Module 1, you should be able to: describe the key structures of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). describe the relationship between state power and the economy in China today.recall how the CCP maintains control over key positions within the government, the army and the courts.evaluate the role of Party bureaucrats on China’s economy and society.Module 2By the end of Module 2, you should be able to:recognize systematic patterns in the ways in which leaders are chosen in China. describe how the background characteristics and views of the leaders have changed over time. assess the different levels of international experience among leaders and among leadership generations. outline leadership strategies for success.Module 3By the end of Module 3, you should be able to:describe how leadership changes in China affect policies. list out the key decision making organizations in China. describe how local governments can push their own interests and resist central policies. recall the role of \"campaigns\" in China, particularly under Mao. list out the conditions that allow for major reforms to occur. \texplain why bad policies could happen under Mao.Module 4By the end of Module 4, you should be able to:assess whether culture has an impact on the level of political activism in Chinese society. recall the different ways that people engage in political activity in China.Module 5By the end of Module 5, you should be able to:explain why China's economy has grown so rapidly in the past 30 years. evaluate the shifts in the role of the private versus the public sector. assess the role of foreign trade and foreign direct investment in China's economic growth. describe rural reform in the late-1970s and early- mid-1980s and the role that the countryside has played in China's economic takeoff.Module 6By the end of Module 6, you should be able to:explain why some people might think that China is a relatively unstable society, while others may argue that it is relatively stable. discuss the relationship between the Middle Class in China and the CCP. discuss the likelihood that China will introduce major political reforms and move towards a democratic political system.ExamNow is time to test your understanding on the entire course.

Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a ‘boiling point.’ Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States’  “rebalance” toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics.\n\nExplore regional cooperation and economy\nFrom a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China’s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor — the United States.\n\nContemplate the future of South Korea\nSouth Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea’s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific. At the same time, the evolving regional order and thus the 21st century global politics would be affected by how South Korea, as one of the key actors of East Asia, behaves toward other regional states.\n\nIn this respect, we aim to understand South Korea within the context of complex and important dynamics concerning global politics and the international relations of Asia-Pacific.\n\nYou will learn with Yong-Soo EUN, Professor of of Political Science and International Studies at Hanyang University, and the Editor-in-Chief Routledge Series, IR Theory and Practice in Asia (https://www.routledge.com/series/IRTPA).\n\nYou can find out more about this course and related issues in Yong-Soo’s homepage:  https://hanyang.academia.edu/YongSooEun \n\n\n                                    ",

Many EU citizens have discovered that what they believed the EU was for does not match what EU institutions are actually doing.\n\nThe lack of proper knowledge about the origins, evolving nature and purpose of European integration is, to a large extent, responsible for many present-day EU problems. This course will help answer many common questions about the EU by:\n\n\n  exploring the history of the EU\n  explaining how the set of institutions that form the EU emerged\n  examining how the purpose of European integration has changed since  the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community.\n\n\nHow did the European Union come about and where is it going?\n\nEuropean integration as we know it is the result of a historical process which is not straightforward and often not rational or logical. The European Union — or the Eurozone — was not based on a specific economic rationale or political theory, but is the result of many governments’ actions in the face of diverse situations. This course will teach you how to analyse the complexity of the current European Union and explore what it could look like in the future.\n\n\n\n                                    ",

En los siguientes cursos de esta serie profundizaremos en cada uno de los componentes del ciclo de gestión pública.\n\nLos países de América Latina y el Caribe enfrentan considerables desafíos de la gestión pública, tales como el diseño de políticas públicas que tengan en consideración los puntos de vista de los diferentes actores; las demandas ciudadanas y los escasos recursos disponibles; la asignación de los recursos financieros; la calidad de los servicios públicos o el seguimiento y la evaluación de la gestión, entre otros.\n\nLa gestión para resultados en el desarrollo y su enfoque de gerencia contribuyen al abordaje de estos desafíos mediante el tratamiento integral de las distintas etapas del ciclo de la gestión pública, el uso de la información para la toma de decisiones y el empleo de múltiples instrumentos y metodologías.\n\nSi tienes alguna pregunta, escríbenos a idbx@iadb.org\n\nLa preparación de este curso fue financiada por el Programa Especial para el Desarrollo Institucional (SPID) del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

In the following courses of this series we will go in depth in each one of the components of the public management cycle.\n\nLatin American and Caribbean countries face considerable challenges in public management, such as the design of public policies that take into account different stakeholders’ points of view; citizen demands and scarce available resources; financial resource allocation; public service quality; and monitoring and evaluation; among others.\n\nManaging for development results and its managerial focus contributes to addressing these challenges through a comprehensive effort involving different stages of the public management cycle, the use of information for decision-making, and the use of multiple instruments and methodologies.\n\nIf you have any questions, please write us at idbx@iadb.org\n\nThe preparation of this course was financed by the Special Program for Institutional Development (SPID) of the Inter-American Development Bank.

Participants will receive practical advice on setting an ethical tone, ethical decision-making, ethical operations, and using campaign ethics to their advantage. Please note that this is a course on ethics and not a primer on the specific laws that regulate the political process. Upon completion, participants will receive a badge from the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics that can be used on campaign websites and other campaign communications.\r\nPublic service is a noble calling. The process of getting there, however, is not always so noble. Our process for electing public officials is born out of the ethical ideal of creating an informed electorate. Regrettably, secret obligations in exchange for endorsements, scripted debates, the influence of big money, and irrelevant, deceptive, and vitriolic campaign communications leave the voter without any real information about what a candidate stands for or to whom the candidate is beholden. Voters feel disenfranchised, believing that their vote no longer matters. Citizens are also frustrated by political polarity and resultant lack of legislative productivity. The public perceives that negotiation and compromise are no longer available tools for those who govern due to obligations created during the campaign process. Moreover, unethical political attacks freely dispensed during a campaign poison later legislative relationships.\r\nStatistics for voter turnout and public trust in government are at historical lows. At the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics we believe that one of the reasons for this civic disengagement is that our political process turns a blind eye toward unethical campaign practices. We believe that encouraging ethical campaigns will decrease political polarity by reducing the rancor in political races, will restore public trust in government by ensuring fairness and integrity in campaigns, and will increase civic engagement by creating a process that not only encourages an informed and involved electorate, but encourages good people to run for office.\n\n                                    ",

Despite statewide interest in Iowa history as documented by the Department of Cultural Affairs, there are few opportunities to learn about it—especially history related to social justice and diversity. In addition, the Iowa Department of Education (IDOE) has surveyed teachers across the state and found that there are currently very few social studies education professional development opportunities for Iowa teachers.\r\n“Teaching and Learning Iowa History” helps to fill that void by providing an innovative approach to connecting the general public, university students, and pre- and in-service teachers interested in learning more about Iowa history. This summer, our focus is on Iowans and the Civil Rights Movement in order to understand the roots of racism in the state and struggles for racial justice through the 19th and 20th centuries.\r\n \n\n                                    ",

Dans quel contexte ces décisions sont-elles adoptées ? Au 21ème siècle, de nombreux paradoxes brouillent la vision que nous pouvons en avoir. Qu’est-ce que le pouvoir dans une société ‘multi-échelles’ ? L’État demeure-t-il un acteur politique majeur s’il est concurrencé par des organisations internationales et régionales ? La démocratie prônée par la communauté internationale peut-elle coexister avec des régimes autoritaires voire totalitaires? Quel est le rôle des citoyens face aux idéologies ? Le cours vise à comprendre et à expliquer des phénomènes politiques à partir d’une posture d’analyse critique.\nA la fin du cours, vous serez capables de :\n\n\t\tDéfinir et expliquer des concepts en science politique.\n\t\n\t\tMettre en lien les concepts avec leurs auteurs et, plus largement, les phénomènes concrets qu'ils désignent.\n\t\n\t\tAmorcer des analyses objectives de phénomènes politiques basées sur les connaissances acquises. \nAvant, pendant, et après le cours, consultez les pages Facebook et Google+ pour les annonces et les discussions.\nPolitics impact all of us: everyday political decisions concern many areas of our lives. In which context are these decisions made? In the 21st century, many paradoxes blur our vision of these decisions. What is power in a multi-level society?

Can democracy – pushed forward by the international community – coexist with authoritarian, or even totalitarian, regimes? What is the role of citizens in regard to ideologies? The course aims at understanding and explaining political phenomena from a critical standpoint. \nBefore, during, and after the course, check out the official Facebook and Google+ pages for announcements and discussions.\n\n                                    ",

Cohen, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, David Estlund, Frantz Fanon, John\nFinnis, Lani Guinier, H.L.A. Hart, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere,\nAyn Rand, John Rawls, Chin Liew Ten, and Jeremy Waldron. \n\nThe aim of the course is not to convince you of the\ncorrectness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you\nwith a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and,\nperhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you\ndisagree.  \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        OverviewWe will begin by thinking about four core values, values\nthat we either want our political institutions to respect or to help us bring\nabout:  happiness, Justice, equality, and freedom.  We will consider\nthese values—and the relations between them—in thinking about the question: Why\nshould we have a State?  We will\nthen consider four more questions, with a unit of the course structured around\neach question.\n\nModule One: Why should\nwe have a State?  Happiness and Justice\n\nHappiness: Many have suggested that the role of the State is to\npromote peace, stability, and human flourishing—in short, to bring about\nvarious kinds of good consequences. \nWe’ll consider some questions about this kind of view.  Should we use an objective measure of\nhappiness or utility, or a subjective measure, based on what people think is good for them\nor makes them happy?  What is the\nrelationship between happiness and economic activity?  How can States promote happiness or individual welfare?  What should the State’s role be in structuring\neconomic activity?  In solving\n‘collective action’ problems?  Are\nStates good at promoting domestic and international peace?  If one role for the State is to prevent\npeople from harming each other, how should we define harm?  How does concern about happiness and\nflourishing differ if there is disagreement within the political community\nabout what is worthwhile?    \n\n Justice: One role offered for the State is in helping to bring about justice.  What does justice require?  Is justice about matching merit and effort with reward?  About making sure the good prosper and the bad suffer?  About making sure that all have enough before some have a lot?  What role does or should the State play in all of this?    \n\nModule Two: Why should\nwe have a State?  Equality and Freedom\n\nEquality: Many suggest that a fundamental concern for the State is to both promote and abide by the value of equality.  Some questions we’ll consider: Should we care about procedural equality (equal treatment under the law and equal say in creating law) or substantive equality (equal distribution of resources, equal access to health care, etc.), or both?  Should our focus be on equality of opportunity?  Why should we care about equality?  What should we be trying to “equalize,” if anything?  What can we make equal?  In what sense are all people created equal?  What role does or should the State play in promoting equality? \n\nFreedom: A final role offered for the State is helping to ensure or\nbring about freedom (autonomy, liberty, non-domination).  Is freedom just freedom from external\nrestraint—not being put in prison or in chains?  Or does freedom require various support, too, so that one is\nnot free to choose one’s occupation if, say, certain educational opportunities\nare blocked for that person?  What\nkinds of freedom are important and valuable, and why?  Should we care about freedom of individuals only, or also\nfreedom of communities?  What role\ndoes or should the State play in promoting freedom?  How does the State threaten freedom? \n\n\n\nModule Three: Should\nour State have borders?  \n\nWhat is the appropriate size and\nbasis of political community? \nShould we be in a political community together because we share a\ngeographic region, a religion, a cultural tradition, a set of values, a\nplanet?  Should we be allowed to\nchange or to choose what political community we are a part of?  If so, how easily?  Should we have open borders?  What is the value of political\ncommunity?  What is the\nrelationship between community and autonomy?  Who should have a say in how the community is governed? \n\nModule Four: Should we\nhave an electoral representative democracy? Should we create laws through representatives,\nrather than directly?  If so,\nwhy?  How should representatives\ndecide what to do once they are in office?  Should they do what we want, just looking at polls of their\nconstituents; or should they do what they think is best?  Should just one person represent a\nparticular district or should we have multi-member districts?  Should representatives be elected, or\nrandomly selected through a lottery? \n\nIf we have elections, how should they be structured and\nregulated?  How frequent should\nthey be?  Should we have term\nlimits?  Should we regulate how\nmuch candidates can spend or what people can say during the electoral\nprocess?  Should all of our votes\ncount equally, or is it acceptable for some to count more because they\nrepresent a distinctive, underrepresented, or better educated voice?  Should voting be legally required?  As a voter, should I vote for what (or\nwhom) I think would be best for me, or best for the country, or best for the\nworld?    \n\n \n\nModule Five: Should our\nState have a constitution?  \n\nShould we have a Constitution?  If so, why?  What kinds of things should be in it?  How should it be created?  How should future generations use it\nand interpret it?  How hard should\nit be to amend it?  If we have a\n‘higher’ law such as a Constitution, who should be in charge of interpreting it\nand making sure its values and limits are honored and respected?  Should it be an unelected court, like\nthe United States Supreme Court? \nOr should it be elected officials? \nShould judges be elected or appointed?  For how long should judges serve? \n\n \n\nModule Six: Should our\nState have prisons?  \n\nWhat should happen to people who\nbreak the law?  Should we punish\npeople?  How?  Why?  How much?  What\ndo a practices of punishment reveal about our moral views of people?  Are those views plausible?  Problematic?  Should we be troubled if a disproportionate number of people\nwho are punished are of a certain race, economic class, or mental health\nstatus?  What is the point of putting\npeople in prison?  What are\nalternatives to incarceration?

This course familiarizes you with some main theories of international relations, shows how the global order is gradually changing and discusses how selected\n    international and regional organizations contribute to the maintenance of global peace and security. You learn what research findings tell us in terms of the capacity of international organizations and actors to help prevent or stop violent conflict,\n    what tools are used to negotiate agreements and how foundations for sustainable peace are best created. In the course, we also focus on the role of the European Union (EU) in terms of diplomacy and efforts to prevent conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty\n    Organization (NATO) and the contribution of some other regional organizations to the prevention of conflict and war. We also look at activities of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and, in the context of a final debate, see in\n    which ways its membership could be adapted to more accurately reflect the power relations of the current global order. You learn about all of these topics by doing quizzes and exercises testing your knowledge of these subjects, helping you understand\n    crucial concepts and get insights into how the academic study of international relations and international organization can contribute to the search for global stability and peace in practice.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course is part of the Specialization track 'The Challenges in Global Affairs', which contains three courses and a capstone project.

It has presented itself as a normative, global actor, and its emergence as a legal entity that is neither a state nor a classic international organization has both puzzled and fascinated legal scholars and political scientists alike.

Join us right up to and through election night as we explore the politics, issues and numbers that give British politics its enduring appeal. This year's election is one of the most exciting and unpredictable in recent memory. Old Westminster certainties like majority governments and the two-party system seem to be under increasing strain. Meanwhile, the implications rise of the Scottish National Party and the decline of the Liberal Democrats are still unclear.The course is designed both as a general introduction to UK politics for people all over the world and as a place for British citizens to come to find the information they need to make an informed choice.

More specifically, it will show how China intervened in the interstate trade and Korean music. \n\nFinally, it will compare the two trajectories of political thoughts between Korea and Japan since 17th century. Korea fantasized itself as the genuine heir and center of the Chinese World Order, closing its door to foreigners. Meanwhile, Japan overcame the Chinese World Order and eventually converted itself as a modern state (1 module).\n\nThe working language is Korean with English subtitles.\n\n                                    ",

Did you know that regional and local governments in Europe manage two thirds of all public investments? Be it the economy, social affairs, territorial cohesion, education, youth or culture, energy, environment, transport, immigration – local government in Europe matters. The importance of the regional and local dimension has continued to increase in Europe. Among the EU institutions in Brussels, the European Committee of the Regions stands up for the rights of citizens, ensuring that the local perspective is heard and giving communities a voice in Europe. This introductory course aims to explain how the European Union works and what the European regions' place is within it. Join us to (re)define the role of regions in European policy making!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 1: EU institutions and legislationThis chapter focuses on the European Union and its legal foundations, institutions and legislation.

Moreover it explains the basics of the EU's legislative process and the guiding principles of EU law.With Professor Alberto Alemanno, HEC University, Paris\r\nChapter 2: The role of regions and cities in EU affairsThe level of decentralisation varies among EU Member States, but regardless of this, the EU matters to all regions and cities and vice versa. This chapter looks into the different levels of government in the EU and their cooperation and influence of regions and cities on EU policies. What are the trends in the development of regions and cities' roles in the EU’s political system? What does multilevel governance mean? What are the upcoming challenges for regions and cities and their “constitutional role” in the EU?With Markku Markkula, President of the Committee of the Regions; Professor Michel Huysseune, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels; and Hella Dunger-Löper, State Secretary, Representative of the Land of Berlin to the Federal Government\r\nChapter 3: EU Cohesion Policy and Structural and Investment FundsThis chapter describes the development and current implementation of EU Cohesion Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds in 2014-2020. Representing one third of the EU budget, EU Cohesion Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds are an important source of funding regional and local projects, with management often at the sub-national level. What is the key rationale of EU Cohesion Policy? How has it developed over time? What will be the future of EU Cohesion Policy?With Iskra Mihaylova, Chair of the Committee for Regional Development, European Parliament; Walter Deffaa, Director General for Regional and Urban Policy, European Commission; and Professor John Bachtler, European Policies Research Centre, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow\r\nChapter 4: Research and innovation; social, employment, education and youth policiesThis chapter is twofold: it presents on the other hand the European employment, social affairs and equal opportunities policies, which aim to increase employment and worker mobility, to improve the quality of jobs and working conditions, to combat poverty and social exclusion, to promote equality, and to modernise social protection systems. On the other hand it discusses the implementation of innovation policies and smart specialisation strategies, a priority for all member states and their regions. These strategies will help to tap into their regional innovation potential, thanks to EU support.With Professor Dominique Foray, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland; Katja Reppel, DG Regional and Urban Policy, European Commission; and Manuel Palazuelos Martinez, Joint Research Centre, European Commission\r\nChapter 5: Environment, natural resources, energy and sustainable development policiesRegions and cities are of key importance when it comes to implementing the EU’s environment legislation and its sustainable development targets. At the same time, regions and cities are unevenly affected by the effects of climate change and the challenges and possibilities of the Energy Union. This chapter focuses on the Paris Protocol: climate change, energy policy and the role of regions and cities: Which are the biggest challenges of the EU's policy on climate change? What role can the regions and cities play with regards to EU climate and energy policy?With Jos Delbeke, Director General for Climate Action, European Commission\r\nChapter 6: Free movement and migrationMigration and the integration of migrant populations are of key political importance at the local level. The objective of this this chapter is to discuss the rationale, legislation and major challenges of related EU policies and the way in which regions and cities are involved in it. What is the role of regions and cities in addressing migration and how can the EU support them? Does increasing international migration require the reform of the welfare state and labour market institutions and if so, how would the EU be involved in it?With Claude Moraes, Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the European Parliament (tbc)\r\nChapter 7: Regions and the single market: industry, SME, competition and digital policiesThis chapter is an introduction to the main principles and sources of EU competition policy and state aid legislation.

In just the last few years, we have witnessed calls from all over the world, from the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to the Open Government Partnership, for governments to become more open, accountable and responsive by deepening their engagement with citizens. As a result, interest in citizen engagement programs for effective development has gained momentum. At the same time the World\nBank Group, which has long recognized the role of citizen engagement in\nimproving development results, has developed a strategic approach to mainstreaming\ncitizen engagement in its operations. This MOOC has been developed to explore what is meant by citizen engagement and how it can be used to enhance development impact.This second offering of the course includes a new, exciting fifth module that looks at citizen engagement in practice. We hear from local practitioners implementing different citizen engagement approaches in various sectors including water, health, and education in Ghana and Kenya. They discuss how citizen engagement mechanisms and tools are adapted for their specific country context and sector, examining practical challenges and lessons learned. We also look at Korea’s innovative approach to involving citizens in the audit of public services. \nThe 5-week course brings together a diverse range of experts to provide students with a comprehensive overview of citizen engagement. It begins by synthesizing the theories and concepts that underlie citizen engagement, and goes on to explore how citizens can be engaged in both policymaking and public service delivery. Finally, the course investigates how recent innovations are shaking up the field, and how citizen engagement is implemented, monitored and evaluated in the field. Our presenters, leaders in academia, government, and civil society, provide a wide range of perspectives and real-world experience to give participants a deeper understanding of whether citizen engagement can truly enhance the process of development. Participants will also have the opportunity to collaborate with one another and design their own citizen engagement initiatives, thereby putting theories learned in the course into practice.\nCourse Instructors and Facilitators \nThe course instructors are Jeff Thindwa, Björn-Sören Gigler,  Tiago Peixoto and Helene Grandvoinnet.

We begin by exploring the definitions and history of citizen engagement, as well as related concepts such as transparency, accountability, responsiveness and inclusiveness. We then look at the concept of the feedback loop, and the differences between intrinsic and instrumental approaches. Next we examine the crucial role of sociopolitical context and the enabling environment, and finally introduce the concept of strategic and tactical approaches to citizen engagement.\n\nWeek 2: Engaging Citizens for Improved Policymaking\nThis week explores the role that citizens can play in actively shaping public policy. We start by examining how citizens participate, analyzing the differences between ‘thick’ and ‘thin’ forms of engagement and asking strategic questions such as who should participate, how should participants interact with decision makers, what information do participants need, and how will participation impact policy decisions. Next, we survey examples of crowdsourcing and open innovation that are helping governments and citizens better interact. Finally, we unpack why citizens participate, moving beyond the mere calculation of costs and benefits described in the rational choice model to an analysis of broader factors that influence participation.\n\nWeek 3: Can Engaging Citizens Bring Better Services?\nIn this week we examine the role of citizen engagement in public service delivery. We first unpack different conceptions of the government-citizen relationship and then explore the ways citizens can serve as active agents of, rather than passive recipients in, the delivery of public services. We then provide an in-depth look at a range of citizen engagement projects in this area by exploring the methods, tools, barriers to inclusion and factors for success of case studies, particularly in developing country contexts.\n\nWeek 4: Innovations in Citizen Engagement\nHaving outlined the role of citizen engagement during policymaking and service delivery, the final week investigates recent innovations in citizen engagement. We begin by examining how recent advances in information and communications technology (ICT) can be used to enhance citizen engagement from a human development perspective, and review some of the most compelling new developments in this area. Next, we explore the reasons why some of these innovative approaches succeed while others fail, and look at how hybrid approaches-those that combine ICT tools with traditional methodologies-are being used in an attempt to maximize development results. \nWeek 5: Citizen Engagement in Practice\n\nThe last module of this course analyzes citizen engagement in practice. We hear from local practitioners implementing different citizen engagement approaches in various sectors including water, health, and education in Ghana and Kenya. They discuss how citizen engagement mechanisms and tools are adapted for their specific country context and sector, examining practical challenges and lessons learned. We also look at Korea’s innovative approach to involving citizens in the audit of public services.\n\n\nWe conclude the course with a review video, as well as ‘call to action’ videos from high-profile leaders in government, civil society and academia and to provide you with tangible next steps to put your knowledge into practice.  \nCourse Tracks\n\nDepending on your level of interest, you can choose to participate in one of two tracks:\n\n\n\nTrack 1: Citizen Engagement Champions (1-2 hours/week)\nTrack 2: Policy and Leadership (2-4 hours/week)\n\nStudents can move from the Citizen Engagement Champions track to the Policy and Leadership track at any point during the course. We encourage students to join the Policy and Leadership track to gain deeper knowledge and practical experience.\n\nTrack 1 – Citizen Engagement Champions\n \n\nTarget Audience\nThis track is suitable for anyone with a general interest in citizen engagement. It provides insight into underlying concepts and current trends in citizen engagement, and the ways in which it can be utilized to improve development results.\n \nTrack-Specific Objectives\n  To understand the theoretical underpinnings of citizen engagement and why it is a critical component of good governance.\n To evaluate current citizen engagement initiatives for development around the world. \n  \n  \n\nAssignments\n\n  Assignments focus on facilitating an understanding of mandatory course material (video talks and core readings) through multiple choice quizzes and peer-reviewed short answer responses.\n Optional exercises are also suggested. \n  \n\n\nTrack 2 – Policy and Leadership\n \n\nTarget Audience\nThis track is designed for those wishing to gain greater practical experience in citizen engagement, as well as to develop networks of practice with counterparts from around the world. Our hope is that this track will catalyze the launch of real-world initiatives.\n \n\nTrack-Specific Objectives\n  To understand the theoretical underpinnings of citizen engagement and why it is a critical component of good governance.\n To evaluate current citizen engagement initiatives for development around the world. \n   To build networks of practice and catalyze collaboration among students. \n      To allow students an opportunity to design and create a citizen engagement project that could be implemented in their community. \n  \n\nAssignments\n\n  Assignments focus on facilitating an understanding of mandatory course material (video talks and core readings) through multiple choice quizzes and peer-reviewed short answer responses.\n Students must also design a citizen engagement project and represent it creatively online through a digital artifact. \n Optional exercises are also suggested. \n\n\nConnect\n\nParticipants are encouraged to communicate and share resources via Twitter—using hashtag  #CitizensEngage— and meetup.com.

Watch the introductory video (on the right) or click here\r\nThe aim of Remain or Leave is to cut through partisan rhetoric and the mass of competing, often contradictory information. What it offers instead is a set of five concise multimedia lectures examining the validity of pro- and anti-EU arguments in an even handed fashion. No prior knowledge of the EU is required and great care has been taken to avoid technical, policy jargon. The instructor, Dr Andrew Glencross(@a_glencross), is an expert in European integration who has published widely in this field. It is supported by a grant from the ESRC UK in a Changing Europe Commissioning Fund.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Sovereignty: Brussels or Westminster?\r\nWeek 2: The Single Market\r\nWeek 3: Immigration and Border Control\r\nWeek 4: Divides amongst British voters\r\nWeek 5: The Risks of Leaving or Remaining\n                                    ",

There will be an EU referendum in June and there will be elections to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly in May. Both of these institutions have a significant impact on people’s lives in Scotland and Wales: they control big public policy issues like health, education and transport.\n\nA great deal has changed since the last devolved elections in 2011. Scotland has voted to remain in the United Kingdom, there is now a majority Conservative government, and there are plans for significant further devolution. What are the big issues at stake in these elections? How does the electoral system work? Why does Scotland have a stronger nationalist party than Wales? Can the SNP retain its majority? Can the Labour Party remain in power in Wales?\n\nJoin us as we explore these issues with the help of expertise from The University of Edinburgh and Cardiff University.

How can open government data be made available to improve public policy making? Which technologies are available to make governments more open and  use open government data?\n\nGovernments all over the world aim to become more open and transparent in order to establish closer ties with their constituents. However, releasing government data involves complex challenges and poses two major concerns. First, many different participants are involved and there are various dependencies between them, and second, the technologies that support open government are fragmented. In addition, it is unclear how different contexts should alter the best practices for open government.\n\nThis course explores the foundations and objectives of Open Government and examines current developments, including the opening and reuse of governmental data such as the release of data by governments in America and Europe.\n\nThis course will empower you by helping you grasp the key principles surrounding open government.\n\nThe topics of the course are applied to concrete cases, which you will be asked to analyze and discuss with your peers.\n\nThis course may be of interest to the following:\n\nStudents interested in the basics of open government, in data-driven governance and data-driven research\n\tProfessionals or researchers working on open government research and interested in strategies and challenges for opening governments\n\tProfessionals or researchers working on open data research or open data initiatives\n\tProfessionals and researchers working on topics related to public values, including transparency and privacy, in a governmental context\n\tSenior administrators, policy advisors, government officials or agency members, who are interested in how ICTs change governments and how ICTs can be used in public administrations\n \n\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ",

Enlargement of EU since 1957. Creation of the European Community. European integration and start of the Cold War. Security and establishment of NATO alliance. integration beyond coal and steel industry. Securing the foundations and establishing the principles of legal compliance. From European Community to European Union. Creation of single market and the pillar structure. EU Treaties. the European Commission. Expanding the Union and creating new institutions. EU Treaty reform. Composition and functions of the European Commission.EU budget and regulations. The Council of the European Union. Composition, history and key roles of the Council. Council of Ministers and distribution of votes. QMV principle. challenges of representing the national interest and mobilising domestic support for decisions reached at EU.\t\n\nStudents will be able to form opinions and positions based on objective knowledge about the EU, avoid stereotypes and critically assess the advantages and challenges of EU integration.\n\nUn-graded, practice assessments (be they quiz, peer review, or programming assignments) are critically important in online, mastery-based learning experiences. Approaches to creating Practice Quizzes include: creating duplicate practice/ungraded quiz questions for each topic/concept tested in summative assessments and focussing learners on commonly missed questions/concepts. Ungraded Peer Reviews or Programming Assignments can be great for guiding learners through steps of a larger problem or project. We recommend some form (3-10 minutes) of formative assessment per lesson (10-25 lecture minutes).\n\n                                    ",

The challenge is how to deliver—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain transformation and achieve sustainability.\n\nThis course is about the “hows” of generating institutional change in hard places. Each week we focus on a different kind of challenge. You will read a case study, examine a problem in detail, help create a “solutions\" toolkit, and then apply these insights to a second case.\n\nThe course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Topics include:\n\nReducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services\n\tUsing citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas\n\tPreventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform; building trust and community and changing public expectations\n\tOvercoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government)\n\tFacilitating coordination at the cabinet level\n\tDeveloping a strategy and the incentives to sustain change.\nDrawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faced and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, as well as offer new proposals.\n\nThrough quizzes and open response assignments, you will be able to share ideas with others and practice what you have learned.\n\nNo certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.\n\n                                    ",

Although Black Studies as a discipline was born out of the radically systemic racial issues of the past century, these issues still blatantly exist in the present day in different forms. MSU professor Donna Rich Kaplowitz recently shared a quote through an opinion letter and on an NPR interview by stating that “we are complicit in perpetuating racism if we are not actively working against it.”eSankofa is a “massive open online community conversation” that invites African American history and heritage to engage with new digital disciplinary studies. This course is designed to increase multicultural viewpoints, foster community collectives of discussion, help you navigate difficult race questions, as well as challenge your thoughts and perceptions about the Black experience. The experience of Sankofa is to give rise to a “call of action” within yourself as a learner to be inclusive of the entire human race.“History is a light that illuminates the past, and a key that unlocks the door to the future.”— Runoko RashidiIn the following five weeks, we will take short surveys to gather anonymous feedback on your understanding of Black Studies and your views of race. Participation will involve sharing personal accounts and interviews from family, friends, co-workers, mentors, or even silent heros through audio/digital stories, engaging in Google Hangout On-Air live events with community members and experts on issues and concerns within the Black experience, and interacting in active discussion forums.  More importantly, this is a space to share your learning through the experience of storytelling.\n\n                                    ",

This free online course will introduce you to the range of political strategies that have been employed to meet these challenges.\n\nUnderstand the diverse forms of cooperation in international politics today\n\nFrom institutions that bring together partners in meaningful and lasting agreements, to more fragile and limited attempts to open dialogue between adversaries, we will offer you an insight into the diverse forms of cooperation that make up international politics today.\n\nWe will also explore a number of the major theoretical approaches, which can help us make sense of the opportunities for and limitations of cooperation in an increasingly globalised and interdependent world.\n\nLearn according to your interests and available time\n\nThe course offers you the opportunity to learn according to your interests and available time. We’ve split each week into activities, which can be completed together or individually. We will explore cooperation through six case study puzzles (each lead by an expert from within the University of Birmingham), which reflect the issues and concerns that dominate current international agendas.\n\nOptional Pre-course Materials - Underpinning Theory\n- Professor Nicholas J Wheeler provides an insight into theory that underpins the study of cooperation in international politics.

They are challenging because different people typically contribute differently to environmental change, and because its effects will be felt differently by different people in different places.\n\nUnderstand environmental injustices\n\nThis free online course will help you understand how injustice is a common feature of many environmental problems. Over 10 weeks, we’ll look at deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate change and other environmental issues, asking questions such as:\n\n●\tCan we manage tropical forests to increase timber revenues and carbon stocks, while ensuring that the people who live in them can fulfil their own subsistence needs and vision of a healthy ecosystem?\n\n●\tHow can protected areas strike the right balance between contemporary global interests in species conservation, local interests, the needs of future generations and rights of nature?\n\nWe’ll show that sustainable environmental management requires attention to justice - that we need to strike the right balance between the needs, interests, rights and aspirations of various stakeholders today, and those of both nature and future generations.\n\nLearn with UEA’s Global Environmental Justice Group\n\nYou’ll learn with the University of East Anglia’s Global Environmental Justice Group - an interdisciplinary mix of scholars interested in the links between social justice and environmental change.\n\nThrough a series of films shot in Africa, Asia and Latin America, you’ll meet environmental activists and find out how justice can be a powerful motivator for environmental action.\n\nYou’ll share your own experiences with other learners around the world, thinking about how you can put academic theory into practice, through course discussions, quizzes and assignments.\n\nThe course will give you a taste of UEA’s MSc in Climate Change and International Development and MSc in Environment and International Development.\n\n\n\n                                    ",

As a participant in this course, you will advise the president in deciding whether, and how, the U.S. should act. Once you’ve made your assessment, you will move on to wrestle with other scenarios preoccupying policy makers. Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? China’s rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take? Leaks are a fact of life — but why do they happen? Who gets them, and why? Should journalists publish or withhold them? Does legal accountability lie with the leaker—or the journalist?\nThis six-week course casts you as advisors on the hardest decisions any president has to make. We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas. We will also have to contend with the reality that government secrets rarely stay that way. Participants will learn to navigate the political landscape of an era in which private remarks become viral tweets, and mistakes by intelligence agencies become front-page stories.\nWeekly assignments require strategic thinking: Analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students will learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo,” combining careful analysis and strategic imagination with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support. They will also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.\n\n \n\nWays to take this course\n\nFrom this page, you may register to view the content for the Open version of this course.

The course will answer such questions, stressing the multi-level dimensions of the work for human rights.\r\nCourse Summary\r\nHuman rights are a complex issue. Their protection and promotion involve a number of actors: from international organisations to local communities, from governments to civil society. Human rights affect all aspects of our life, as individuals (as women, men, children, refugees, workers…) and as members of a community. This MOOC provides students with critical knowledge concerning the norms, institutions and procedures tasked to promote and protect human rights. Students will acquire the knowledge needed to actively join the global debate on fundamental rights and to avail themselves of the existing legal and institutional tools set up for their implementation. The MOOC introduces to the human rights legal framework in a multi-disciplinary and multi-level perspective, helping students to approach real-life scenarios with competence and cultural and ethical awareness.\r\nWhat do I learn?\r\nStudents are expected to acquire a sound knowledge of the international system of human rights protection, and of the opportunities for human rights promotion and protection that are practically available at the national and local levels. The skills acquired can be preparatory for further specialisation on this subject. Finally, students will be able to apply the acquired knowledge and skills to real scenarios, including in relation to their everyday life.\r\nWhat do I need to know?\r\nThe MOOC is mainly addressed to people from all over the world who have a background in political science, international relations and/or international law. The course, however, includes a general introductory chapter explaining the main issues, concepts and scenarios at stake. For this reason the MOOC is also open to people actively engaged on the ground that do not have a specific academic or educational background.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 1 - The basics The Chapter aims to introduce the course and starts addressing (and providing some preliminary answers) some basic questions: What are human rights? Who is involved in their protection? Why are human rights a global priority? How can effectively be protected?\r\nChapter 2 - The UN and human rights The focus is on the evolution of the UN commitment in human rights protection based on three pillars: positivisation, monitoring and mainstreaming.\r\nChapter 3 - The UN human rights machinery The analysis deals with the UN mechanisms for the protection of human rights at the global level. Special attention will be given to the role of the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review.\r\nChapter 4 - The European system for the promotion and protection of human rights The Chapter starts looking into the promotion and protection of human rights at regional (continental or sub-continental) levels. In particular, the European system will be presented highlighting the respective roles of the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the OSCE and their capacity to interplay and possibly complement each other.\r\nChapter 5 - Regional systems for the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa, Asia and the Americas The other regional systems investigated in this chapter are those operating in the framework of regional organisations in the Americas (the Organisation of American States), in Africa (the African Union), in the Arab world (the League of Arab States), as well as in South-East Asia (the ASEAN).\r\nChapter 6 - Human rights in conflict and post-conflict contexts The focus shifts to the national level, in particular to situations of armed conflict and to post-conflict scenarios. Issues related to the standards and procedures of International Humanitarian Law and International Criminal Law are also tackled.\r\nChapter 7 - Human rights promotion and protection at the National and sub-national level This Chapter addresses a number of issues related to the role of National Human Rights Institutions and other actors involved in human rights policies nationwide and at the local/community levels, such as local governments and municipalities.\r\nChapter 8 - The driving forces of human rights promotion: the role of civil society The Chapter focuses on civil society organisations and networks. The analysis looks into the multifaceted strategies carried out by non-state actors, especially in relation to the international instances of human rights protection.\r\nChapter 9 - Conclusions: perspectives on global human rights A summary and discussion of the multi-level dimensions of human rights protection dealt with in the previous chapters. This final segment provides some closing critical reflections on the questions set forth in Chapter 1.\r\nMid –term homework At the end of chapter 4, the instructions for homework will be released: homework must be submitted by the end of chapter 6 (2 weeks). Homework consists of writing a communication or a petition addressed to one of the monitoring bodies studied in the first four chapters. The aim is to familiarise students with the tools of human rights protection mechanisms. The texts will be evaluated using a peer review methodology.\r\nFinal homework At the end of chapter 8, the instructions for homework will be released: homework must be submitted in 2 weeks. Students will be asked to write, using a simplified form, a project addressing a human rights related issue that is challenging their town, territory, home country and likely to be taken up by governmental or non-governmental agencies.\r\nWithin each chapter, the MOOC offers tailored case-studies, interviews with field experts, officers and academics.\n                                    ",

They have the will to build change and a vision of a better future for citizens. The challenge is how to deliver on the promises made—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain improvement.\r\nThis course introduces a way to think about solutions to common, yet difficult delivery challenges. Each week we will read a case study together, examine a problem in detail, create a “solutions” toolkit, and highlight potential obstacles. Then we offer you a second case study on the same theme. You will have a chance to offer your own thoughts and review one another’s suggestions and ideas. Although it is possible to audit the course, we hope most of you will join a team and collaborate with others to come up with new ideas.\r\nThe case studies explore a range of institutions and institutional changes, although all focus on creating the underpinnings for economic growth, improved quality of life, inclusiveness, and peace—four broad “development challenges.” Drawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faces and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and offer new proposals.\r\nThe course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Sample topics include: reducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services; using citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas; preventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform (focused on anti-corruption commissions and port reform); building trust and changing public expectations (city management examples); overcoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government); facilitating inter-ministerial coordination at the cabinet level; strategy development and institutional transformation.\r\nMore Information \r\n\r\n\r\nThe course has nine sessions. You should plan to set aside about 3-5 hours a week to participate, although videos and exercises are broken into short segments so that you can allocate your time easily. \r\nThrough a number of different exercises, you will get the chance to develop and apply your understanding of the course topics. You can take multiple choice quizzes to test that you have understood key concepts, ideas and theories. We also encourage you to form a team with other participants, and to work with them on team assignments. The team work will give you an opportunity to offeryour solutions to some of the reform challenges we discuss, and share your ideas with the rest of the class.\r\nStudents who complete the course work, will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. It is free and not for Princeton University credit. \r\nThe course is led by Professor Jennifer Widner of Princeton University, with the help of a number of other scholars and practitioners. It draws on open-source reading selections published by Princeton University’s Innovations for Successful Societies program.\r\n\r\n\n\n                                    ",

Par les cartes, l’iconographie, les vidéos, l’infographie et les jeux de rôle, le Mooc restitue les principaux enjeux géopolitiques propres à l’Europe, tout en insistant sur les représentations dont elle est l’objet dans le monde. Résolument pluri-disciplinaire, ce mooc offre aux apprenants une boite à outils forgés par le recours à une combinaison originale d’histoire, de géopolitique, d’économie, de science politique, de géographie, et de droit.Format : le parcours pédagogique est progressif et modulaire. Il se décline en six séquences thématiques sur six semaines. Chacune d’elle bénéficie d’une variation de l’échelle et de l’angle d’approche. A chaque séance, l’exploration du problème principal est pensée comme un cheminement libre mais bien balisé par six étapes : une mise en situation cartographique, l’étude d’un corpus documentaire, un gros plan sur les perceptions nationales et un éclairage sur l’actualité. Les acquis de ces quatre premières étapes peuvent ensuite être testés dans un quizz d’évaluation, et mis en pratique lors du jeu de rôle final ou serious game : un scenario européen, une mission et … des décisions à prendre !\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Séquence 1 : Les cartes à géométrie variable du territoire européen : qui et quoi fixent ses limites à l’UE ?Séquence 2 : L’intégration européenne : un projet territorial et politique inéditSéquence 3 : Les grands défis des Européens d’ici à 2050Séquence 4 : L’Europe dans l’Espace mondial : puissance, influence ou marginalisation ?Séquence 5 : Est-Ouest vs Nord-Sud : les nouveaux clivages de l'Europe ?Séquence 6 : L’Europe dans les yeux du monde\n                                    ",

Topics include national identity, language diversity, the global labor market, popular culture, sports and climate change.\n\nHowever, an increase in integration has not brought increased equality.

The sessions will include case studies on Guantanamo Bay, lethal drone strikes, weapons of mass destruction in the Syrian conflict, counter-piracy operations, international terrorism and investment disputes. The purpose of this course is to assess whether, and to what extent, international law has been a factor in the resolution of international controversies.\n\nDuring this course you will begin to learn about the role and the limits of international law as a tool for influencing behaviour and for settling disputes.

Our goal in this course is to gain more understanding of what U.S. foreign policy is, who makes it, why is it the way it\n    is, and how it affects the rest of the world.

We seek to do so as a community of learning committed not only to the curricular objectives for our course, but seeking to demonstrate to the world how to conduct informed and respectful discourse on subjects which have plenty of\n    room for disagreement.The first week of the course provides an overview and analytic framework, and focuses in on the process and politics by which U.S. foreign policy is made. Each of the next five weeks is geared to U.S. foreign policy in different\nregions: Asia with a particular focus on U.S.-China relations; the Middle East and such issues as Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, Syria, and the Arab uprisings; relations with Western Europe and Russia; relations in the Western Hemisphere with Latin America\nand Canada; and key issues in U.S.-Africa relations.

Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher’s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors.  Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control.  It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course.  We will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records, cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks, stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples, systematic selection, and stratified multistage samples.  The course concludes with a brief overview of how to estimate and summarize the uncertainty of randomized sampling.\n\n                                    ",

In the initial years of the opening, external forces influenced China’s economy, regional balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected China’s internal development. We then look at various aspects of China’s “going out strategy” — its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of China’s opening to the outside world.\n\nPlease note that this course currently does not offer certificate.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Orientation and Module 1Before you start with the content for Module 1, please watch the Course Overview, review the Assignment and Grading page, and provide us with some information through the Pre-course Survey.By the end of Module 1, you should be able to: describe how external events can affect a country’s internal development. describe the extent to which the shape of the global system affected how China opened. explain the domestic demand for the opening.Module 2By the end of Module 2, you should be able to:explain the impact of various international and domestic forces on China’s foreign policy, as well as the role of individual leaders on Chinese foreign policy. describe China’s relations with most of its key bilateral interlocutors and its role in multilateral institutions. assess China’s strength relative to other countries.Module 3By the end of Module 3, you should be able to:explain why Chinese firms have been going abroad in such large numbers in the past 5 years. evaluate the risks to China of its dependence on oil imports. evaluate whether or not the US has used China’s energy dependence to slow down its rise.Module 4By the end of Module 4, you should be able to:assess the efforts of the Chinese government versus the role of China’s market in attracting high quality talent to return from abroad. recall the role of the Chinese diaspora in enhancing China’s level of scientific technology.Module 5In this module, we invited three professors from various universities in Hong Kong to share with us their views on China's foreign policy and China's rise.By the end of Module 5, you should be able to:articulate different views about key questions related to China and the world.assess, with some degree of confidence, how China’s rise is and may affect the world in future.Final Exam\n                                    ",

Located in the west of the European continent, Switzerland is a small but wealthy country, which is surprisingly not a member of the EU. Did you ever wonder what the reasons for this are? And have you ever thought about what legal conditions govern this exceptional relationship?\r\nIn this free online course, we will attempt to answer some key questions, including:\r\n\r\nWhat is the general place of Switzerland in the ‘legal (and political) landscape’ of Europe?\r\nWhat effect does the special situation of Switzerland have for the debate in other countries on issues such as taxation and migration?\r\n\r\nLearn to distinguish fact from myth\r\nThis course offers a legal and political look at the position of Switzerland in Europe and its challenges as a non-Member State of the EU. We will put a particular focus on much debated and sometimes misunderstood issues such as corporate taxation, banking secrecy and the debate about curbing immigration. With this in mind, you will be able to reflect on Switzerland, the EU and regional integration on a differentiated basis.\r\nExpand your knowledge through case studies\r\nIn addition to case studies on ‘money’ and ‘migration’, we will also discuss the present negotiations between Switzerland and the EU on the institutional framework of the Swiss-EU legal relationship. Studying the case of Switzerland from different angles will not only further your legal knowledge but also sharpen your awareness of the high degree of interconnectedness of countries in the modern world. After this course you should be able to apply your knowledge in other contexts - for example, when assessing news about regional integration in Europe or elsewhere.\n\n                                    ",

We will revisit and tackle the perceived “truths” about the meaning of European identity and Europeanness. We will examine the ways in which cultural knowledge and facts were constructed to further integration processes in post-World War II Europe.\n\nYou will analyse and explain the intertwined relationship between culture and politics in constructing and governing contemporary Europe. You will gain deep understanding of how struggles over the meaning of Europe have shaped European contemporary society and how they will shape Europe’s future. We will help you understand and identify the complexities of the contemporary crises of European integration and support you in developing novel responses to these crises.\n\nDevelop your intercultural communication skills with researchers and learners throughout Europe\n\nThe course has been developed by the Euroculture programme, which conducts research and runs a multi-university master’s programme on European culture and politics.\n\nBy joining this course and discussing your ideas with thousands of other learners across and beyond Europe, you will develop your intercultural communication skills and gain experience of discussing controversial and complex issues honestly and respectfully.\n\nIn the first week, you will examine Europe as a cultural project. You will learn how European culture is imagined and constructed by European institutions via the EU’s language policy or the Capital of Culture programme, but also how these top-down interventions into the meaning of Europe are challenged by local/grass-root cultural practices and interventions.\n\nIn the second week, you will look at the role religion plays in European politics and societies. You will revisit the role of religion in European public spheres and you will critically examine secularisation and the idea of a secular Europe.You will see if Europe can be identified through a particular religion (or absence of religion). And you will see how religion has been used to identify what is Europe and what is not Europe\n\nThe third week considers Europe’s relationship with modernity. Europe is often held as a standard: it is where modern science developed, where modern political systems came into being and where modern literary genres were invented. You will look at the assumptions behind and implications of this idea of modernity.\n\nIn the fourth week, we turn to the nation-state. Although the EU is often said to be the anti-thesis of the nation-state, some have argued that it has actually saved it. You will examine the EU as an unique experiment in the creation of a post-national political entity. You will also be asked to rethink the existing forms of political organisation in Europe and propose sustainable solutions for problems linked to integration beyond the nation state.\n\nThe fifth week examines how Europe is constructed as a democratic space. You will see how European political integration has been furthered and legitimised through a particular reading of democracy. Focus is placed on challenges and possible solutions to the construction of democracy in a post-national society.\n\nIn the sixth week you will examine how European identity is constructed via practices of othering; claims of what Europe is not. By addressing the question of Europe’s other we will not only gain a better perspective on how Europe is imagined but also whose voices remain silent/marginalised in this process. If we want to build a more inclusive Europe – and we do – critical questions of who is Europe’s other and how is Europe imagined by this other – need to be addressed.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n\ndescribe how European political integration is embedded in broader cultural modalities such as language or memory;\nexplain Europe as a multifaceted and ever-changing entity;\ndefine the main transdisciplinary debates on Europe and European identity;\nunderstand deeper and more underlying roots of contemporary problems of Europe integration;\npropose innovative sustainable solutions to these problems;\ndebate sensitive topics in a culturally and academically diverse environment. \n\n\n\n\n                                    ",

But who provides these bodies with the information they need and shows them the strategic options they have? Who frames political action before the wider public even takes notice of the issue? How does political agenda setting work and what do certain policy outcomes tell us about the future of the issue at stake?This course is designed to outline key features of policy advice and political consulting and their impact on governance.We will observe the key players on the spot as well as those behind the scenes and we will analyze their patterns of interaction. Moreover, we will provide insights regarding essential questions to which there are no single right answers: What role does policy advice play in different democracies? What is good policy advice? What makes an expert? In sum: Whom do (and should) politicians and society listen to, and what do (and should) they make of the advice they receive?\r\nWhat do I learn?\r\nBy the end of the course, students will know the key concepts of policy advice as well as the main actors in the field and their patterns of interaction. They will understand how and by whom a certain political decision is framed, shaped and implemented.

So, first and foremost, they will be able to ask the right questions.\r\nWhat do I need to know\r\nThe course is designed to cater for students and professionals who are interested in decision making, political communication, policy advice, and consulting. Course participants are expected to follow current politics and to be keen on looking at the matter from different (and sometimes unusual) perspectives.

How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.\n\nIn today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.\n\nWhen you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.\n\nWe invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. \n\nThis course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.\n\nLICENSE\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\nCredits banner\n\nPhoto Obama by NASA CC BY-NC\n\nPhoto Thatcher by British Wallpaper CC BY-NC-SA\n\n                                    ",

On these premises we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalization, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future).This course does not aim at communicating any 'message' as to how politics ought to be, but it will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - we make use of while talking about values and principles in politics; this is what is called 'normative political philosophy' and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics).\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\nAt the end of the course you may have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of the political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you may get better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes that you do otherwise approach in a fragmented perspective.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n       Aim and method of the course.

It will outline the fundamentals of doing research, aimed primarily, but not exclusively, at the postgraduate level. It places the student experience at the centre of our endeavours by engaging learners in a range of robust and challenging discussions and exercises befitting SOAS, University of London's status as a research-intensive university and its rich research heritage.\n\nThe course will appeal to those of you who require an understanding of research approaches and skills, and importantly an ability to deploy them in your studies or in your professional lives. In particular, this course will aid those of you who have to conduct research as part of your postgraduate studies but do not perhaps have access to research methods courses, or for those of you who feel you would like additional support for self-improvement. No prior knowledge or experience in research is required to take this course and as such, the course is for everyone. \n\nThis MOOC draws on a wealth of existing course material developed to support research training across SOAS, University of London and particularly drawing from the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy (CISD). In 2015, the course was nominated for the prestigious Guardian University Award for its innovative approach to online learning.\n\nParticipation in or completion of this online course will not confer academic credit for University of London programmes\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        E-tivity 1: What Is Research and What Makes a Good Research Question?PURPOSE: To focus upon formulating a research question. TASK: Please compose a brief question pertaining to your proposed research - whatever the subject - and post it under the 'My Project' tab in the peer review exercise below. Be brief insofar as it would fit on one metaphorical or literal 'Post-It' note. Also watch our interview videos below. RESPONSE: Having reflected on the videos, review other students' questions. Feeding back is an important part of the research process, so please spend some time providing considered feedback for three or more colleagues here. OUTCOME: You will have given considered thought to composing a research question and provided feedback to others on theirs. E-tivity 2: What Is a Literature Review and Why Do We Need to Do One?PURPOSE: To familiarise yourself with the nature and benefits of conducting a literature review. TASK: Please read the following three pieces on literature review, in conjunction with the interviews below. Then post your thoughts on one of the readings to the 'My Project' tab of the peer review (200 words). RESPONSE: Provide feedback on three or more submissions by your fellow students. OUTCOME: Upon the completion of the full cycle of this e-tivity, you will be able to distinguish the qualities of a literature review and begin to reflect on the value of a literature review to your own project. E-tivity 3: Why Are Planning and Management Skills Important for Research?PURPOSE: To be aware of the planning and management skills that are required in undertaking critical thinking for your research. TASK: Please watch the videos below, and also read the chapter provided. In conjunction with your reflections on the learning material provided and also research planning and management in general, please post your thoughts on the chapter, in no more than 400 words, under the 'My Project' tab.

We start with a survey of the major political theories of the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition. In each case we begin with a look of classical formulations, locating them in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they relate to politics today.\n\nNext we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations. The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to Moral Foundations of Politics Enlightenment Political TheoryThis module explores what makes a government legitimate.

It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.\n\nTestimonials of students who completed this course:\n\nI've been studying one particular aspect of the field for about fifteen years now, but lacked the sort of wider context that this course has provided. And I've made contacts here that I hope will develop into friendships.\n-Charles Cameron, 69, Blogger Religious Studies, UK\n\nThis has been a wonderfully enriching experience. I have learned a lot, and have especially appreciated the worldwide perspectives of the class found in the discussion forum. Being in this class has helped me open up the subject to discussion with colleagues and friends, which has led to interesting and insightful conversations. The class materials were effective and polished. The peer reviewed assignments were challenging and fun. This was my first MOOC, but certainly not my last!  \n-Joella Givens, 50, GIS Manager at a state government Department of Transportation, USA\n\nThe theoretical aspect was similar to the one offered by well respected universities for introductory courses on terrorism. For just 5 weeks, I think this course covered a lot of ground. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the discussion forums. (...)In addition, I found excellent recommendations on books, articles, documentaries, all of great quality.\n-Arete Ketekidou, 32, Research/Analyst, Greece\n\nI like very much the freedom we have to study, this is the best incentive, not only because we can express our ideas on forums freely and manage our own time, also because Professor Bakker has not been imposing his ideology on this topic. We receive different information to formulate our own position.\n-Valeria Hernández Reyes, 28, Environmental Engineer, Mexico\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome In this module, you can find all the information you need in order to be able to successfully complete the course.Definition and Essence of TerrorismWelcome to the first module! You will learn about the definition of terrorism. What exactly is terrorism? Who and where are its victims? After completing this module, you will understand why it is so difficult to arrive at a generally accepted definition of this term.Researching Terrorism and CounterterrorismIn this module, you will learn more about terrorism and counterterrorism studies. It is a relatively new field of study that owes much to research in related disciplines. You will get an overview of where the key centres and scholars are located. Also, you will understand the three main approaches that are used in this academic field and recognize their strengths and weaknesses.5 Assumptions on TerrorismThe subject of terrorism often falls prey to unfounded assumptions. Media, politicians, but also scholars frequently make far-reaching claims about this topic, such as the notion that terrorism is caused by poverty. In this module, we will critically investigate some of these assumptions to see if they are indeed true, partly true, false or perhaps even a myth (a widely held belief that is nevertheless still false). 5 Assumptions on CounterterrorismIn this module, we will continue the work of module 3 and look into five assumptions on counterterrorism. It is highly relevant to keep investigating assumptions that underlie CT-policy, both from an effectiveness perspective (is it really countering terrorism?) but also because these policies often have a large impact on societies and might also have unintended consequences. Dealing with Terrorism and the FutureAfter having tested these assumptions, we will make up the balance sheet. What are some of the remaining “un- and underresearched” topics in (counter)terrorism studies? We will also explore the concepts of fear management and resilience. Finally, we will look into the future of terrorism: what can we expect in the years to come?Making Headlines Today - Foreign FightersThe final module of this course will look into a highly topical and politically sensitive issue of today: foreign fighters. Since the beginning of the civil war, high numbers of foreign fighters have joined the struggle, including many from Western countries. In this module, we will see who these people are and why they are going. Also, we will discuss to what extent these fighters pose a threat and which policy options are available to address this phenomenon. Please note that the world has not stood still since these videos were recorded in October 2014 and that some numbers might already be outdated. We will regularly add an extra video to give a brief update on this issue. About Us &amp; Further ExplorationFind out more about studying in Leiden.\n                                    ",

By the end of the course, you will be able to apply the knowledge gained for analysis and management of international cyber incidents and conflicts including for activities such as development of policy related to cybercrime and cyberwarfare. Management of cyber incidents and conflicts requires an interdisciplinary perspective including an understanding of: 1) characteristics of the cyber threats and conflicts themselves, 2) international efforts to reduce and improve cyber security, and 3) psychological and sociopolitical factors. \n\nThe course is designed to reach an international audience and will encourage discussion on relevant current events among participants to enrich the experience with various personal and cultural perspectives on cutting-edge issues. In addition, assignments and other assessments will supplement video lectures and selected readings to ensure application of the material.\n\n\nAfter taking this course you will be able to:\n\n• Identify different types of actors involved in cyber threats (individuals, organizations &amp; nation-states)\n• Distinguish between different types of threats and issues in cyber security including, data theft, political espionage, critical infrastructure protection, and propaganda\n• Detail the basic characteristics of the Internet infrastructure and international efforts to address Internet governance\n• List several international efforts to address cyber crime and espionage\n• Evaluate how principals that govern international conflicts might be applied in context of cyber security\n• Apply different psychological theories of human motivation and cooperation and communication and political theories in analysis of different international issues related to cyber security including censorship, media operations and role of social technologies.\n\n\nGrading:\n\nYour grade is assessed based on discussion posts and quizzes.

By learning how Europe works, a new world will open up to you and \ndiscover new jobs you never heard of.\n\nThe European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of everybody’s life. We will analyze what the EU is doing for YOU regardless of where you live. We will also look at what YOU can do for and in Europe.\n\nWhether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. \n\nWhile the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, in 50 years it accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize. The EU remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history.\n\nGiven its inherent complexities, this Course aims at empowering you on what Europe can offer and will enable you to discover jobs and opportunities you were not aware of. Indeed, throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action.

Lo que los gobiernos hacen, y dejan de hacer, para hacer frente a los problemas colectivos. Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.\n\nA lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.\n\n Los objetivos de este curso son:\n1.\tMostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.\n2.\tTransmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.\n3.\tContribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.\n\n\nPor ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas. También se dirige a estudiantes que se dispongan a iniciar estudios de grado o postgrado en administración pública, gestión pública o análisis de políticas públicas.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        MÓDULO 0. Presentación e información básica ¡Bienvenido al curso de Democracia y decisiones públicas! Estás a punto de acceder a los contenidos de este curso y a empezar a trabajarlo. Pero primero, nos gustaría, con esta sección previa, darte la bienvenida y ofrecerte unas pinceladas básicas sobre el funcionamiento del curso. \n\nNo olvides leer atentamente la página de \"Preguntas frecuentes\".MÓDULO 1. IntroducciónBienvenido al curso “Democracia y decisiones públicas: una introducción al análisis de políticas públicas”. Con este primer módulo, te incorporas a una comunidad de personas de distintos puntos del planeta que ha decidido adentrarse en el intrincado y fascinador mundo de la política y las políticas públicas. A lo largo de las ocho unidades que siguen intentaremos responder a algunas preguntas comprometidas: ¿Quién nos gobierna? ¿Por qué la política consigue complicar cosas que aparentemente son sencillas? ¿Quién decide qué es un problema público y qué no lo es? ¿Son racionales las decisiones públicas? ¿Es posible un gobierno basado en el conocimiento? ¿Hemos sabido dotarnos de un sistema verdaderamente inteligente y democrático? De momento, te invitamos a seguir la primera serie de vídeos docentes y lecturas recomendadas para conocer mejor qué nos traemos entre manos y puedas decidir si es de tu interés. Al ser una unidad introductoria, no hay aún ejercicios. El trabajo empieza en el módulo 2. Un saludo cordial del equipo del curso \"Democracia y decisiones públicas. Introducción al análisis de políticas públicas\": Jaume Blasco, Joan Subirats, Ismael Blanco, Marc Parès, Raquel Gallego, Quim Brugué, Marga León y Jaume Badosa. MÓDULO 2. Problemas¡Entramos en el segundo módulo de “Democracia y decisiones públicas”!  En este módulo vamos a hablar sobre el punto de partida de las políticas públicas: los problemas públicos. Podría parecer una cuestión irrelevante, porque los problemas son tantos y tan graves que saltan a la vista. Sin embargo, a lo largo de los vídeos, veremos que hay pocos problemas que salten a menos que alguien los haga saltar.  La construcción de los problemas es una fase de la formación de políticas proclive al juego subterráneo y subliminal, a las estrategias discursivas y a la comunicación política. Justamente por ello, es especialmente interesante. Después de una introducción relajada, este es el primer módulo con ejercicios sobre los vídeos y lecturas. ¡Nos vemos entre problemas, agendas y discursos!MÓDULO 3. ActoresEmpieza el módulo 3, en el que vamos a hablar de actores. Si la vida es un teatro, como decía Shakespeare, más lo es la política. Tan dada, unas veces, al vodevil, y otras, a grandes discursos que han cambiado el curso de la historia. Y si la política tiene sus actores, también los tienen las políticas públicas: son todos aquellos que, habiendo sido invitados o presentándose sin previo aviso, saltan a la arena pública para intentar influir en la formación de las políticas. Son los gobiernos, los parlamentos, la administración pública, pero también el movimiento okupa, una asociación ecologista, un empresario que soborna políticos, o un académico que escribe influyentes artículos de opinión en el periódico. ¿Qué mueve a los actores políticos a actuar? ¿Cómo interactúan entre ellos? ¿De qué recursos disponen para influir? De todo ello vamos a hablar a lo largo de este módulo, con un énfasis especial en la crisis de representatividad de los actores colectivos, la transición de la vieja a la nueva política, y la emergencia de Internet como nuevo escenario en el que se mueven los actores políticos. ¡Nos vemos entre bambalinas!MÓDULO 4. DecisionesEntramos en el módulo 4 y con él alcanzamos el ecuador del curso. Llega un momento en el que los poderes públicos \"deciden\" y las políticas públicas -o sus reformas- ven la luz: se retrasa la edad de jubilación, se decide urbanizar una antigua zona industrial, se incluye un nuevo tratamiento en la cartera de servicios de la sanidad pública, o se adopta una regulación más estricta sobre el uso de pesticidas en la agricultura. Se trata de un momento esencial en la formación de las políticas públicas, que suele consistir en que una persona investida de autoridad formal firme un decreto en una mesa ministerial, o en que un parlamento vote, con cierta solemnidad, la aprobación de una norma. Pero lo cierto es que en las sociedades pluralistas las decisiones suelen tener más padres y madres que los formalmente reconocidos. Las redes decisionales son más complejas de lo que aparentan, con la participación de diversos actores políticos en conflicto y una elevada incertidumbre sobre los resultados que acarrearán las decisiones. En esta sesión nos preguntaremos quién decide y cómo se decide en políticas públicas: ¿existe realmente el \"decisor\" público? ¿es posible tomar decisiones estrictamente racionales? Y, si no son racionales, ¿qué criterio las guía? Y lo que es más importante: ¿cómo se debería decidir para alcanzar decisiones más democráticas e inteligentes? Muy contentos de que hayáis \"decidido\" acompañarnos hasta aquí, os animamos a continuar hasta el final. ¡Ánimos, que esta unidad viene más ligera de vídeos y lecturas!MÓDULO 5. InstrumentosEmpezamos el módulo 5 en el que el profesor Quim Brugué nos va a hablar de las cosas que gobiernos y administraciones \"hacen\" con relación a los problemas colectivos: proveer servicios, regular derechos y actividades, poner impuestos, dar subvenciones, promover partenariados público-privados... Lo cuestión que se abre ante nosotros es qué pueden hacer, pero también cómo y quién lo debe hacer, para que las soluciones, efectivamente, resuelvan los problemas. En este sentido, existen diversas herramientas y estrategias para \"hacer las cosas\", que se enmarcan en los diversos modelos de gestión pública. Empezamos preguntándonos dónde estamos y por qué estamos donde estamos, haciendo un breve repaso a la evolución histórica, desde la administración pública tradicional a la Nueva Gestión Pública. A continuación, y ante los grandes retos que persisten, dedicamos la mayor parte de los vídeos a proponer una particular visión de la reforma que la administración pública requiere: la transición hacia un nuevo paradigma de gestión pública relacional y deliberativa. El tipo de administración que queremos no es una cuestión puramente instrumental (dar con el sistema que mejor \"funciona\") sino que tiene también un gran contenido ideológico: es una representación de la sociedad en la que nos gustaría vivir.  En los últimos dos vídeos, el profesor invitado Dennis C. Smith, de la New York University, hace una exposición y defensa de la aplicación de los instrumentos de la Nueva Gestión Pública en el Departamento de Policía de Nueva York. Revisemos pues, las cajas de herramientas, que la instalación es antigua y, aunque de momento nos ilumina, ya hace tiempo que sufre cortocircuitos.MÓDULO 6. ImplementaciónEn 1973 los profesores Pressman y Wildavsky publicaron el libro \"Implementación\", con el sugerente y extenso subtítulo: \"Cómo las grandes expectativas de Washington se desvanecen en Oakland; o, por qué es asombroso que los programas federales lleguen siquiera a funcionar, siendo esto una epopeya de la Administración de Desarrollo Económico, contada por dos observadores solidarios que buscan levantar una moraleja sobre las ruinas de unas esperanzas frustradas\". El módulo 6 que presenta Raquel Gallego, sigue la estela de este libro y pone la atención en una de las fases del ciclo de las políticas menos visibles: el momento posterior a la decisión. Del dicho al hecho hay un gran trecho, dice el dicho -valga la redundancia-. No es suficiente haber decidido una cosa para que ocurra, y es posible que lo que ocurra sea distinto de lo que se había decidido. A lo largo de esta semana veremos que la puesta en práctica no suele ser una mera ejecución mecánica de un plan o decisión. En realidad, sigue el juego político, sigue habiendo actores influyendo sobre la política pública (aunque no necesariamente los mismos que en otras fases), y se continúan tomando múltiples micro-decisiones que acaban configurando lo que, en la práctica, la política pública acaba siendo. Que tengáis un buen día.MÓDULO 7. EvaluaciónBienvenidos al módulo 7, sobre evaluación de políticas públicas! Nos evalúan en la escuela para certificar que hemos adquirido unos conocimientos; nos piden evaluar al telefonista que nos atiende para saber si nos ha tratado bien; evaluamos películas, restaurantes, libros, discos, hoteles, y hasta países enteros, para que otros puedan decidir si merecen la pena sobre la base de nuestra experiencia. Así que evaluar políticas públicas para determinar si resuelven los problemas sociales para los que han sido diseñadas tampoco parece la idea de un genio. Resulta más bien obvio. Sin embargo, algo hay que no cuadra. Si tan obvio es, ¿por qué pervive la sensación de que la evaluación de políticas es algo relativamente nuevo? ¿Por qué persiste cierta percepción de que se evalúa poco y mal? ¿Por qué parece que, aunque se generen evidencias, estas no acaban de tener un papel influyente en el diseño de las políticas? Parte de la respuesta se halla en el mismo proceso de formación de las políticas públicas que hemos estado estudiando estas semanas: la evaluación aporta análisis racional a un proceso que no es puramente racional. Se basa en la lógica de la resolución de problemas, pero esta no es la única lógica en el tablero. El científico social generador y portador del conocimiento se ve obligado a interactuar con otros actores políticos. El conocimiento es un recurso más en el juego, pero el conocimiento no es el juego. Existe, además, una dificultad añadida: determinar si una política pública tiene un impacto positivo sobre la necesidad o problema que le da razón de ser puede resultar más complicado de lo que parece. En este módulo 7 veremos por qué y nos adentraremos en los métodos para la estimación de impactos. Y todo ello sin usar prácticamente las matemáticas. En todos los vídeos de la semana, aparece solo una resta. ¡Ánimos!, que esto se está terminando.MÓDULO 8. ConclusionesLlegamos al octavo y último módulo del curso, con un conjunto de reflexiones de Joan Subirats sobre cómo Internet ha cambiado el juego, las funciones (y tensiones) del analista político, la doble crisis y el reto de repolitizar la democracia. Le acompañan un conjunto de profesores invitados, la mayoría de los cuales aúnan la condición de académicos del ámbito de las ciencias sociales y de ex-políticos, a los que hemos sometido a una misma y Lindblomiana  pregunta: \"Dado que todo se reduce a que las decisiones sean democráticas (en cuanto al proceso por el que se adoptan) e inteligentes (en cuanto a su capacidad para solucionar problemas): ¿dónde estamos actualmente en este doble reto?\". Veréis que la mayoría coinciden a considerar que nos hallamos en un momento de frustración y cambio. Son tiempos revueltos y estimulantes. Con las reflexiones que clausuran el curso, también llega el examen final. El examen contiene algunas preguntas sobre los vídeos de este último módulo, incluyendo los de los profesores invitados. No olvidéis dejarnos vuestra opinión sobre qué os ha parecido el curso en el foro de discusión. Esperamos reencontraros pronto en otra ocasión virtual o presencial... ¡Ha sido un placer!\n                                    ",

This is not a “how–to-do-it” course on data collection, but instead reviews the literature on survey design decisions and data quality in order to sensitize learners to how alternative survey designs might impact the data obtained from those surveys.\n\nThe course reviews a range of survey data collection methods that are both interview-based (face-to-face and telephone) and self-administered (paper questionnaires that are mailed and those that are implemented online, i.e. as web surveys). Mixed mode designs are also covered as well as several hybrid modes for collecting sensitive information e.g., self-administering the sensitive questions in what is otherwise a face-to-face interview. The course also covers newer methods such as mobile web and SMS (text message) interviews, and examines alternative data sources such as social media. It concentrates on the impact these techniques have on the quality of survey data, including error from measurement, nonresponse, and coverage, and assesses the tradeoffs between these error sources when researchers choose a mode or survey design.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introduction, Classic Modes of Survey Data Collection In this lesson, you will be introduced to some key concepts about survey data collection methods that we will rely on throughout the course.  By the end of this lesson, you should be well acquainted with the major sources of survey error and how these are affected -- usually in the form of tradeoffs -- by the particular mode used to administer questions and capture responses.Module  2: Self-administration, Online Data CollectionThis second lesson focuses on modes in which survey respondents self-administer questions and provide their responses directly to researchers.  By the end of Lesson 2, you will understand the pros and cons of self-administered modes from the TSE perspective.Module 3: Interviewers and InterviewingIn this lesson, we explore the various roles interviewers take on beside asking questions and collecting answers, as well as some of the different approaches to interviewing that have been proposed and how they affect the accuracy of responses.  By the end of Lesson 3, you will appreciate the benefits and costs of collecting data in interviews and will be able to contrast them with the costs and benefits of self-administration. Module 4: Emerging modes, new data sourcesIn this lesson, we focus on some new data collection modes such as mobile web surveys and SMS text interviews, as well as alternative data sources such as sensor data, administrative data, and social media.  By the end of this lesson, you will have a sense of the issues to which survey methodologists and survey researchers are devoting much of their attention these days. You will be able to weigh the pros and cons of these new methods and data sources. \n\n                                    ",

En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\", \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados por Sciences Po para este MOOC están a cargo de Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\n\nPerfil recomendado\n\nEl curso está diseñado para estudiantes de pregrado, pero también puede ser de interés para estudiantes de posgrado y profesionales en el sector de asuntos urbanos.\n\n\nPrograma del curso :\n\nSemana 1: Introducción, definición, asuntos urbanos y el uso de modelos\nSemana 2: Ciudades europeas y el modelo weberiano de integración\nSemana 3: Ciudades coloniales y poscoloniales\nSemana 4: Ciudades industriales (y ciudades socialistas) y modelos marxistas\nSemana 5: Las metrópolis norteamericanas y la Escuela de Chicago \nSemana 6: Posmetrópolis, fragmentos y diferencias\nSemana 7: Ciudades globales y megaciudades\nSemana 8: Ciudades inteligentes y la sociología de la ciencia y la tecnología\n\n                                    ",

L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? \nPour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nPlan du cours\n\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies\n\n                                    ",

Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents). There will be also assignments that consist in participating to discussions related to theoretical models presented in the course based on case studies of your choice, and peer assessments on your contributions.\n\nSyllabus :\n\nWeek #1 : Introduction, definition, urban questions and the use of models\n\nWeek #2 : European cities and the weberian model of integration\n\nWeek #3 : Colonial and post colonial cities\n\nWeek #4 : Industrial cities (and Socialist cities) and Marxist models\n\nWeek #5 : The American metropolis and the Chicago School, \n\nWeek #6 : Post metropolis, fragments and differences\n\nWeek #7 : Global cities and mega cities\n\nWeek #8 : Smart cities and the sociology of science and technology\n\n                                    ",

Why some materials conduct heat or electricity while others are insulators?  Why adding just a small amount of carbon to iron results in an alloy that is so much stronger than the base metal?  In this course, you will learn how a material’s properties are determined by the microstructure of the material, which is in turn determined by composition and the processing that the material has undergone.\n\nThis is the first of three Coursera courses that mirror the Introduction to Materials Science class that is taken by most engineering undergrads at Georgia Tech.  The aim of the course is to help students better understand the engineering materials that are used in the world around them.  This first section covers the fundamentals of materials science including atomic structure and bonding, crystal structure, atomic and microscopic defects, and noncrystalline materials such as glasses, rubbers, and polymers.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction [Difficulty: Easy || Student Effort: 1hr 30mins]This module will introduce the core principles of materials science.  Topics that will be covered include the different general material types (metal, ceramic, polymer, etc.) and the properties associated with each type, some methods that are used to experimentally determine and quantify a material's properties, and how a materials engineer might go about choosing a suitable material for a simple application.  This module also introduces the concept of the microstructure-processing-properties relationship which is at the heart of all materials science. Atomic Structure and Bonding [Difficulty: Easy || Student Effort: 2hrs]In this module, we will discuss the structure of the atom, how atoms interact with each other, and how those interactions affect material properties.  We will explore how the types of atoms present in a material determine what kind of bonding occurs, what differentiates the three types of primary bonds - metallic, ionic, and covalent, and the implications of the type of bonding on the material microstructure.  You will learn how atoms arrange themselves as a natural result of their size and bonding.  This knowledge will provide you with a foundation for understanding the relationship between a material's microstructure and its properties. Crystalline Structure [Level of Difficulty: Medium || Student Effort: 2hrs 30mins]This module covers how atoms are arranged in crystalline materials.  Many of the materials that we deal with on a daily basis are crystalline, meaning that they are made up of a regularly repeating array of atoms.  The \"building block\" of a crystal, which is called the Bravais lattice, dtermines some of the physical properties of a material.  An understanding of these crystallographic principles will be vital to discussions of defects and diffusion, which are covered in the next module. Point Defects and Diffusion [Level of Difficulty: Medium || Student Effort: 2hrs 30mins]In the previous module, we learned how the lattice structure of a crystalline material in part determines the properties of that material.  In this module, we will begin to learn how defects - deviations from the expected microstructure - also have a large effect on properties.  This module covers one-dimensional, or point, defects which can be missing atoms (vacancies) or excess atoms (interstitial solution) or the wrong type of atom at a lattice point (substitutional solution).  Building on these concepts, part of this module will cover diffusion - the movement of atoms through the crystal structure. Linear, Planar, and Volumetric Defects [Level of Difficulty: Medium || Student Effort: 2hrs 40mins]This module covers two- and three-dimensional defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, and precipitates.  The discussion extends to explain how deformation of a material is accommodated at the microscopic level.  We will finish by addressing how the presence and properties of defects can increase or decrease the strength of a material.Noncrystalline and Semicrystalline Materials [Level of Difficulty: Medium || Student Effort: 2hrs 30mins]In this module, we discuss materials that are not fully crystalline, such as polymers, rubbers, and glasses.  You will learn how the absence of crystallinity affects the behavior of these materials and what factors affect their formation and properties.  Lessons include discussions of the microstructure and defects in amorphous materials, partial cystallinity in polymers, and demonstrations of materials exhibiting ductile and brittle behavior at different temperatures. \n                                    ",

Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WelcomeWhat you should know before you start the courseAccelerating Materials Development and Deployment •\tLearn and appreciate historical paradigms of advanced materials development while emphasizing the critical need for new approaches that employ data sciences and informatics as the glue to connect computational simulation and experiments to speed up the processes of materials discovery and development.\n•\tLearn about the emergence of key national and international 21st century initiatives in accelerated materials discovery and development and how they are expected to bring about a disruptive transformation of new product capabilities and time to market.Materials Knowledge and Materials Data Science •\tUnderstand property, structure and process spaces\n•\tLearn about Process-Structure-Property Linkages \n•\tLearn what does Materials Knowledge mean\n•\tLearn about a role of Data Science in Materials Knowledge System\n•\tOverview approaches and main components of Data Science\n•\tLearn about a new discipline - Materials Data SciencesMaterials Knowledge Improvement Cycles•\tLearn material structure and its digital representation\n•\tLearn how to calculate 2-point statistics \n•\tLearn how Principal Component Analysis can be used to reduce dimensionality\n•\tUnderstand Homogenization and Localization concepts\nCase Study in Homogenization: Plastic Properties of Two-Phase CompositesThis module demonstrates a homogenization problem based on an example of two-phase compositesMaterials Innovation Cyberinfrastructure and Integrated Workflows•\tLearn about materials innovation system and cyberinfrastructure\n•\tReview Materials Databases, e-collaboration platforms and code repositories\n•\tLearn why integrated workflows are needed\n•\tDefine Metadata, Structured and Unstructured data\n•\tLearn about available services for e-collaborations\n\n                                    ",

Nous allons aborder tout d'abord les propriétés physiques des fluides : les états de la matière et la notion de viscosité. Un chapitre sera dédié à la tension de surface et à la capillarité. Nous introduirons ensuite le concept de similitude et l’utilisation des nombres adimensionnels. Nous allons alors considérer la statique des fluides à travers la loi de l'hydrostatique. La dynamique des fluides sera abordée en premier lieu par la cinématique. Ensuite, nous traiterons des équations de bilan avec notamment une application du théorème de conservation de l’énergie cinétique : le théorème de Bernoulli. Dans le dernier, nous montrerons que ce théorème relativement simple permet d’expliquer et de calculer des écoulements tels que ceux observés dans les rivières. Les vidéos du cours seront enrichies de vidéos d’expériences qui illustreront les concepts clés et par des quiz pour tester votre intuition et vos connaissances. Le dernier module vous permettra de piloter à distance une expérience d'hydraulique qui a lieu dans les laboratoires de l'EPFL.\n\nThis course is presented in French. \n\n                                    ",

This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered.

Descreveremos brevemente todos os problemas que serão estudados, motivaremos as soluções que serão apresentadas.Senóides ContínuasNeste módulo, faremos uma breve revisão de sinais senoidais a tempo contínuo. Veremos que todo sinal na prática podem ser escritos como uma combinação de sinais senoidais. A vantagem disso é que em muitos casos, como na amostragem, é muito fácil ver o que um sistema faz com uma senóide. Usando o fato de que tudo é uma combinação de senóides, fica então fácil ver o que o sistema faz com um sinal qualquer.Senóides DiscretasNesse módulo, veremos as senóides a tempo discreto. Como no caso contínuo, também podemos construir qualquer sinal prático como combinação de senóides. Mas as senóides discretas possuem alguma particularidades. Em particular, veremos que existe uma maior frequência possível para a senóide discreta, e que alguns sinais de diferentes frequências podem ser indistinguíveis. Esse fenômeno está intimamente ligado, por exemplo, ao fato de que a roda de um carro de fórmula 1 parece que está parada na transmissão da TV.AmostragemNesse módulo, estudaremos em detalhe a amostragem, o processo que converte um sinal analógico em um sinal digital. Isso é o que é feito, por exemplo, em uma câmera digital e na gravação de um áudio em um smartphone. Veremos primeiramente o que ocorre quando o sinal amostrado é uma senóide. Com isso, poderemos modelar o aliasing, a principal distorção introduzida no processo. A partir desse modelo, poderemos especificar sistemas que diminuem o impacto dessa distorção.ReconstruçãoNesse módulo, estudaremos a reconstrução, o processo que transforma um sinal digital em um sinal analógico. Veremos como podemos modelar esse processo e, a partir desse modelo, como podemos especificar filtros que minimizem as distorções resultantes.ConclusãoEsse módulo traz um resumo de tudo o que foi visto no curso. Nesse apanhado geral, veremos a principal conclusão da amostragem, chamada de teorema de amostragem: se a taxa de amostragem e os filtros forem adequadamente escolhidos, é possível recuperar perfeitamente um sinal a partir de suas amostras.\n                                    ",

Our entire built environment - from world famous skyscrapers to house extensions - all rely on the expertise of the construction industry for design, procurement, production and management. Yet, despite significant technological advances, many of the practices of the construction industry remain relatively unchanged compared to other industries. Clients, architects, engineers, surveyors, project managers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and facilities managers can all work more effectively if they harness the potential offered by digital construction.\r\nIn simple terms, digital construction is concerned with the digital information required for designing, procuring and constructing buildings and other structures, and for operating the completed buildings or structures . We hear a great deal these days about BIM (Building Information Modelling) which can mean different things to different people. Whether it be creating 3D models or processes to manage information, BIM is challenging the way we work in the industry. This course will certainly consider BIM, but digital construction can also refer to simple ways in which we can use digital technologies to create, store, share and validate information, and to communicate and collaborate with each other.\n\n                                    ",

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.\nBy considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.\nControl technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.\nCharacterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. \n\n                                    ",

But did you know that 3D printing is also enabling life-saving and transforming medical procedures, which were unthinkable a few years ago?\n\nWelcome to the world of 3D printed body parts\n\nThe world of medicine and biomaterials has collided with advances in 3D printing. In a recent case, an infant was born with a rare and life-threatening birth defect, and was unable to breath unaided. A CT scan of the boy’s airways was used to 3D print a bio-sleeve, which was a perfect fit for his bronchus. The material used dissolves in the body, giving the boy’s bronchus time to grow strong, before disappearing, without the need for surgery.\n\nThis incredible story is an early example of a new clinical paradigm in biomedicine: 3D bioprinting.\n\nDiscover what 3D bioprinting can do now and in the future\n\nThis free online course tells the story of this revolution, introducing you to commonly used biomaterials, including metals, ceramics and polymers, and how bioprinting techniques, such as selective laser melting, hot-melt extrusion and inkjet printing, work. Through case studies - ranging from hip implants to facial transplants to lab-grown organs - we’ll answer questions such as:\n\n\n  What is 3D printing and how did it come about?\n  Is it really possible to print structures that incorporate both living and artificial components?\n  How long before we can print whole body organs for transplants?\n  What is possible right now, and what will be possible in 20 and 50 years’ time?\n  And what are the limitations of this technology?\n\n\nThis course will also equip and encourage you to become part of the story. You’ll be given guided opportunities to not only investigate the 3D printing facilities available to you, but to also design, potentially print and share your creations with your fellow learners.\n\nYou can find out more in Gordon Wallace’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “How is 3D printing revolutionising healthcare?”\n\n\n                                    ",

At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. We will consider: linear elasticity (recoverable deformation at small displacements), viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material). Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.\n\nThis is a past/archived course.

Par arme aérienne on entend l'utilisation de la troisième dimension et ses supports à des fins militaires. La troisième dimension est l’espace aérien, c’est-à-dire l’espace où on peut se déplacer de façon horizontale et verticale.C'est un MOOC introductif qui cherche à faire appréhender aux élèves les contraintes et forces d’une armée à forte dominante technologique. Le module vise également à faire comprendre aux élèves les impératifs physiques d'une utilisation de la troisième dimension. Le module tente donc de faire la synthèse des contraintes politiques, physiques et opérationnelles qui dimensionnent l'utilisation du ciel et de l'espace à des fins militaires.Son but est de faire acquérir, par une approche capacitaire, la compréhension de l’ensemble du spectre des missions dévolues aux forces aériennes. Il traite de façon introductive les principes physiques liés au fonctionnement des aéronefs et systèmes d’armes et des moyens mis en œuvre dans l’armée de l’air.

Pour cela, il dispose de différents outils de dimensionnement :\r\n\r\nla théorie des poutres permet, dans le cas où les solides possèdent des géométries élancées, d’obtenir rapidement des dimensions adaptées aux différents critères du cahier des charges ;\r\nla mécanique des milieux continus permet de dépasser ces restrictions sur la géométrie mais possède l’inconvénient majeur de conduire à des problèmes mathématiques complexes dont on ne peut extraire la solution ;\r\nla simulation numérique, via la méthode des éléments finis, permet de fournir une solution approchée au problème de mécanique des milieux continus et donc de finaliser le dimensionnement.\r\n\r\nL’objectif pédagogique principal est de présenter et de mettre en œuvre les différents outils de dimensionnement en calcul de structures.

In all these fields, one needs to deal extensively with fluid flow related phenomena and one needs to resolve flow-related features of the processes and equipment. Although the equations governing fluid flow have been formulated more than 150 years ago, it is only in recent years that these are being solved in the practical applications in which the flow occurs.

One can undertake a large number of virtual experiments based on the model equations of a process to optimize the operating conditions and/or design the system efficiently. In most of the practical processes, model equations involve more than one parameters leading to partial differential equations (PDE). Various solutions techniques are adopted by the process engineers to solve the partial differential equations. Separation of variables is one of the most robust techniques used for analytical solution of PDEs. This technique provides first hand information of process dynamics rendering it amenable for optimization of system performance. This course aims to develop the solutions techniques and hence the skills of the students to solve PDEs for any engineering applications. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 : Introduction, Definition &amp; Type of PDE; Classification of various boundary condition &amp; PDEs; Application of principle of linear superposition for PDE; Introduction of separations variables methods for solution of PDE.\r\nWeek 2 : Solution of parabolic PDE using separations variables methods ; Solution of higher dimensional PDEs.\r\nWeek 3 : Solution of Elliptic &amp; Hyperbolic PDE using separations variables methods.\r\nWeek 4 : PDE in cylindrical and Spherical coordinate.\n                                    ",

The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging. With the analytic approach, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and medical doctors are pursuing an understanding of the mechanism of the mind and its biological basis, with the help of engineering and philosophy.\n\nThis program will help students make a basis for interdisciplinary research by providing opportunities to understand what is undertaken in other disciplines and how to collaborate and exchange ideas with people from other disciplines.

A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.\n\nThe intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.\n\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.\n\n \n\nFAQ\n\nIs there a required textbook?\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.\n\nCan I still register after the start date?\nYou can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.\n\nHow are grades assigned?\nGrades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice \"Concept Questions \" completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.\n\nHow does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?\nVideo lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.\n\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\nYes, transcripts of the course will be made available.\n\nWill the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?\nYes, all the material will be made available to all students.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites?\nThe student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.\n\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\n                                    ",

Chaque semaine, nous vous proposons 2 à 4 vidéos (environ 10 à 15 minutes pour chaque vidéo) de présentation du thème abordé. Ces vidéos sont accompagnées de petits QCM de compréhension qui vous permettront de vous évaluer. Une dernière vidéo spécifique développe le thème de la semaine sous forme d’un exercice entièrement traité. Pour favoriser les échanges entre les apprenants et les familiariser davantage avec les notions acquises, des sujets d’exercices à traiter de façon collégiale seront proposés\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Semaine 0 : Introduction au MOOC MSD Le calcul du bon dimensionnement des structures est indispensable dans l’industrie. Avec les notions de développement durable et d’économie d’énergie, il n’est plus envisageable de sur-dimensionner une pièce. Cette première semaine sera aussi l’occasion de se familiariser avec les différents outils proposés dans le MOOC et d’en comprendre le fonctionnement.Semaine 1 : Notion de repère et référentiel Pour que tous les acteurs puissent communiquer correctement entre eux, il est indispensable d’avoir un langage commun et de se positionner les uns vis-à-vis des autres, voire des structures étudiées. Cela nous conduira à présenter la notion de tenseur, en particulier du second ordre, et d’imaginer des modes de représentations graphiques de ces nouvelles entités. L’application portera sur les grandeurs caractéristiques d’une surface plane (isobarcentre, moment statique, moment quadratique, axes quadratiques principaux).Semaine 2 : Etat de déformation Le mouvement des corps engendre toujours des déformations, mais ces dernières sont plus ou moins visibles selon l’intensité des efforts appliquées, le dimensionnement de la pièce ou le matériau employé. Nous verrons comment déterminer sans ambiguïté ces déformations ce qui nous conduira à définir les dilatations linéaires et les distorsions angulaires. L’exemple sur la base d’une notion de cisaillement permettra de mettre en évidence l’intérêt des directions principales de déformation.Semaine 3 : Etat de contrainte Les efforts sont parfois appliqués à la surface de la pièce étudiée mais ils transitent ensuite dans tout le domaine pour assurer l’équilibre global. Ce transit va nous conduire à la notion de contrainte. En application, nous verrons comment il faut associer les contraintes dues à une sollicitation combinée de flexion – torsion sur un domaine de type poutre.Semaine 4 : Lois de comportement Pour une même géométrie et pour un même chargement, tous les corps ne réagissent pas de la même façon. Ces différences sont dues au fait que tous les matériaux n’ont pas le même comportement. La fable du chêne et du roseau nous invite à être prudents sur la classification de la matière et des structures. Il est donc essentiel d’être capable d’évaluer correctement la dépendance entre les déformations et les contraintes pour avoir de bons éléments de classification. L’application montrera toutefois qu’il est important d’avoir l’hypothèse complémentaire d’isotropie du matériau pour pouvoir traiter des cas simples.Semaine 5 : Applications en élasticité linéaire Avec le modèle simple de l’élasticité linéaire nous pouvons déjà traiter de nombreux problèmes de dimensionnement d’un solide dans la vie courante. Ce dernier chapitre permettra donc d’aboutir à des exemples concrets de calculs de pièces sollicitées mécaniquement et dont il faudra assurer le bon dimensionnement. Les pièces de révolution en chargement axisymétrique constituent de belles applications.\n                                    ",

Can the present world and Olympic records in\nathletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This\ncourse provides the answer to these questions. It shows that\naerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex\nand that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused\nby the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same\ncounter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both\nsports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will\nhelp you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes\nand of modern building design. In\n2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a\nTour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25\nkm, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the\nsubsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat\nthe former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic\nimprovements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,\nsurprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team\ntime trial has not yet been explored.\nRecords\nin athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and\nthe long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International\nAssociation of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed\n2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail\nwinds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be\ndecisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum\naerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.\n\nNew\nand prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of\nthe world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy\nsystems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance. \n\n\nThe\ncourse starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of\nfluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary\nlayers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and\nbuilding aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the\naerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and\ntricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This\nknowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building\naerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics,\nwhere some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be\nshown.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nThis\nis a six-week course with the following contents: \n\nWeek\n1: Basic\naspects of fluid flow \n\nFluid properties - part 1 (velocity, pressure, temperature)Fluid properties - part 2 (density)Fluid properties - part 3 (viscosity)Flow properties - part 1Flow properties - part 2Fluid statics, kinematics, dynamicsBoundary layers - part 1Boundary layers - part 2Boundary layers - part 3The atmospheric boundary layer\n\nWeek\n2:  Wind-tunnel testing\nWhy wind-tunnel testing?Wind-tunnel types and applicationsThe atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnelWind-tunnel componentsMeasurements and flow visualizationSimilarity and flow qualityBest practice guidelines\t\nWeek\n3: Computational Fluid Dynamics\n\n\nComputational\nFluid Dynamics: what, why and how? \n\n\n\nApproximate\nforms of the Navier-Stokes\nequations\n\n\n\nTurbulence\nmodeling\n\n\n\nSome\naspects of discretization\n\n\n\nNear-wall\nmodeling\n\n\n\nErrors\nand uncertainty, verification and validation\n\n\nBest\npractice guidelines\n\n\n\nComputational\nWind\nEngineering – Part 1\n\n\n\nComputational\nWind Engineering – Part 2\n\n\nWeek\n4:  Building aerodynamics\n\n\nWind\nflow around buildings – part 1\n\n\n\nWind\nflow around buildings – part 2\n\n\n\nPedestrian-level\nwind conditions around buildings – part 1\n\n\n\nPedestrian-level\nwind conditions around buildings – part 2\n\n\n\nPedestrian-level\nwind conditions around buildings – part 3\n\n\n\nNatural\nventilation of buildings\n\n\n\nWind-driven\nrain on building facades – part 1\n\n\nWind-driven\nrain on building facades – part 2\n\n\n\nWind\nenergy in the built environment – part 1\n\n\nWind\nenergy in the built environment – part 2\n\n\n\nWeek\n5: 100 m sprint aerodynamics\nWhy study sprint aerodynamics?Mathematical-physical model of runningWind effectsAltitude effectsStadium aerodynamics and sprint recordsInterview with a professional athletics coach\n\nWeek\n6:  Cycling aerodynamics\n\n\nWhy\nstudy cycling aerodynamics?\n\n\n\nWind-tunnel\ntesting for a single cyclist – Part 1\n\n\nWind-tunnel\ntesting for a single cyclist – Part 2\n\n\n\nCFD\nsimulations for a single cyclist\n\n\nAerodynamics\nof two drafting cyclists\n\n\n\nAerodynamics\nof drafting cyclist groups\n\n\n\nAerodynamics of car-cyclist combinationsInterview  with professional cycling coaches from teams Belkin and RaboLiv\n                                    ",

This course provides the insights and tools for biotechnological processes design in a sustainable way. Five experienced course leaders will teach you the basics of industrial biotechnology and how to apply these to the design of fermentation processes for the production of fuels, chemicals and foodstuffs. Throughout the course, you will be challenged to design your own biotechnological process and evaluate its performance and sustainability. The undergraduate course includes guest lectures from industry as well as from the University of Campinas in Brazil, with over 40 years  of experience in bio-ethanol production.

The first part of this course is focused on exploring the different disciplines of engineering and providing participants with a broad background in different areas of engineering.\n \nDo you want to learn how race-cars are built? How robots are able to work independently? How unmanned vehicles are designed and built? How is energy harvested? How is energy stored? How are organs built? How is the body imaged? How do you design an aircraft? How do electrons travel in micro and nanoelectronics? How are drugs delivered in the body? How do you build on soils that are unstable? How do robots see? How is light used in devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed? How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services reach their destination? How do you start a company? What are the underlying ethical and social responsibilities of being a professional engineer? These are all things that engineers are dealing with on a daily basis and will form the basis of the first part of the course.\n Introduction to Engineering Mathematics\n \nMathematics is an integral part of engineering and Engineering Mathematics is the process of applying the principles of mathematics to solve real life engineering problems.  A reference textbook will be used for this part of the course and is entitled “Introductory Mathematics for Engineering Applications” by Kuldip S. Rattan and Nathan W. Klingbeil. Publisher: John Wiley and Sons, ISBN:978-1-118-14180-9.\n \nTopics to be covered in mathematics will include: application of algebra in engineering in linear and quadratic equations, trigonometry in motion of robots, application of complex numbers in electrical circuits, use of systems of equations to solve problems in statics, dynamics and DC circuits. Concepts of derivatives will be introduced and its application in engineering problems such as dynamics, electrical circuits and mechanics will be explored.

First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. How to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements. By considering which are the benefits of the control and the challenges for the future will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.\r\nWhat do I need to know?\r\nIn this course, maths are avoided as much as possible and most of the concepts are explained by words, but the generic concepts of operators and relationships between variables are used through the course. A basic and general knowledge of physics will help to understand some phenomena but it is not mandatory. The teacher is co-author of an introductory book on the subject, Feedback and control for everyone published by Springer in 2010.\r\nWhat will I learn ? \r\nControl technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution. Characterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements. You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: Examples of signals and systems\r\nUnit 2: Models of signals and systems\r\nUnit 3: Controlled systems: properties\r\nUnit 4: Control systems design\r\nUnit 5: Control benefits\r\nUnit 6: Topics to study\n                                    ",

Have you ever wondered what are the chips and components inside them? how much they cost? And how they are manufactured? In this course we will learn about ‘Nanomanufacturing’ which is the underlying technology to make the different semiconductor chips and components that enable these devices.\r\nWe will ponder upon issues like: how the post-PC era is changing the semiconductor industry? What’s ailing Moore’s law? I will combine my experience from teaching this course at Stanford and my work in the industry to make you aware of the ‘state of art’ in the semiconductor and display industry. We will have lots of fun too! I will take you on field trips where you can check out some of the action with me.\r\nWhat we will cover in each of the 6 weeks is described in more details below; if that piques your interest, please sign up. I look forward to seeing you in class!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: LCD and OLED Displays We will detail on the nanomanufacturing steps involved in making a start of art LCD/TFT display. We will answer questions like why making high resolution displays such as Apple’s retina display requires moving all the circuitry to the back? What’s needed to make a display which is readable in sunlight? To reduce its power consumption? We will also cover the new technologies like: OLEDs, oxide based transistors etc. that point to a BRIGHT future in the field of display technology.\r\nWeek 2: Lithography and Patterning Lithography is the most expensive part of fabricating a chip today and many believe that it might be the Achilles’ heel which brings to an end the cost saving achieved by Moore’s law. Moreover the way we achieve smallest feature sizes using a given lithography source is continuously changing. In this part we will discuss evolutionary solutions such as double patterning, quad patterning, and things on the horizon such as EUV, and also revolutionary solutions such as direct printing, self-assembly etc.\r\nWeek 3: Process Technology and Moore's Law We will spend time on developing the fundamentals of process technology and how the different process steps are combined together to make a logic or a memory chips. We will classify the processes as additive vs. substantive and also as line-of-sight vs. conformal. We will also look at Moore's law and see what is ailing it today.\r\nWeek 4: FinFETs In this section we will discuss the various nanomanufacturing steps involved in making a start of art microprocessor. Process technology for FinFETS will be described.\r\nWeek 5: Flash memoryWe will discuss the various nanomanufacturing steps involved in making a start of art flash memory chips which are ubiquitous in smartphones, tablets and solid state drives today. Discuss recent trends such as 3D NAND etc.\r\nWeek 6: Packaging and 3D ICs We will discuss the advantages and challenges of integrating chips made using different processes and achieving different functionality into a single monolithic package. We will explain how nanomanufacturing technology is enabling things like interposers (2.5D), through silicon via (TSV), microbump etc.\n                                    ",

Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher.

At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\n\n8.02 is the second semester of the MIT introductory physics sequence. Passing the online version of this course will guarantee you an MITx certificate of achievement The course is on electricity and magnetism which are at the heart of Maxwell's equations. We will study electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic forces, conductors and dielectrics, electromagnetic waves, and the nature of light. This online version follows the MIT on-campus class as it was given by the renowned Professor Walter Lewin in the spring of 2002, and includes his video lectures and problem solving sessions. Professor Lewin, proclaimed \"a Web Star\" by The New York Times, has supplemented his lectures specifically for 8.02x by including interactive questions to help students check their understanding during the lectures themselves. Also, the course uses prize-winning animations and interactive simulations developed under the leadership of Professor John Belcher for MIT's Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) classroom.\n\nIn addition to the basic concepts of Electromagnetism, a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course including: Lightning, Electric Shock Treatment, Electrocardiograms, Metal Detectors, Musical Instruments, Magnetic Levitation, Bullet Trains, Electric Motors, Radios, TV, Car Coils, Superconductivity, Aurora Borealis, Rainbows, Radio Telescopes, Interferometers, Particle Accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, Mass Spectrometers, Red Sunsets, Blue Skies, Haloes around Sun and Moon, Color Perception, Doppler Effect, Big-Bang Cosmology.\n\nYou will complete automatically graded weekly homework problems and a series of exams using multiple choice, numerical and symbolic questions to test your understanding and to help you master the material. Lectures are interspersed with questions that must be answered before advancing to the next lecture segment. There is a moderated forum for student-to-student threaded discussions. While homework deadlines will be strictly enforced, the lowest homework grade will be dropped. Your grade will be based on interactive questions during the lectures (5%), homework problems and simulations (20%), three midterm exams (15% each), and the final exam (30%). Depending on what percentage of all the points you get, your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% of the points must be obtained to qualify for a certificate of mastery.\n\nABOUT THE LECTURES\nLewin's lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally, his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics, 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT'S OpenCourseWare, iTunes U, YouTube and Academic Earth. These lectures are being watched by about 5000 people daily from all over the world, that's about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their class rooms, and Bill Gates wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once, and that he learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.\n\n                                    ",

Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results.\n\nTU Delft’s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters.\n\nThe course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance.\n\nThe course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences.\n\nThis course is aimed towards Engineering and Earth Sciences students at Bachelor’s, Master’s and postgraduate level.\n\n \n\nLICENSE\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ",

Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the key performance indicators that are essential to improving the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.\nOnce participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance. A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation. Participants will also be able to define and establish the necessary metrics to measure the performance of a Smart City.\n\n                                    ",

At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.\n\nPart 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.\n\nPart 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.\n\nPart 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).\n\n \n\n                                    ",

You need Engineering Mechanics - the science-based analysis that engineers use to predict how their designs will perform, so they can meet their responsibilities for performance and safety.\n\nIt starts with physics - forces, equilibrium, acceleration, gravity - but then engineers adapt it to their own purposes\n\nIn this free online course, you will learn analytical skills, use them to understand experiments, and apply them in design. You will be living in the engineer’s world.\n\nAn unusual approach to learning Engineering Mechanics\n\nEach of the seven weeks of this course has:\n\n\nan introduction to set the scene;\nexperiments to introduce physical reality;\nanalysis videos, paper and pencil tutorials and in some weeks on-line Adaptive Tutorials to help you develop insights and skills; \na design activity to give you engineering context (except Week 1);\nand a review process to consolidate your learning.\n\n\nExperiments will be a special feature. You can do them yourself using common household items such as rubber bands, paper clips, string and cardboard, a toy vehicle. Videos and downloadable instructions will guide you. We hope you’ll do some of them, but if not, you can get what you need from watching the videos.\n\nAdaptive Tutorials will be another special feature. They provide a personalised learning experience through virtual ‘learning by doing’ activities that adapt to your progress.\n\nHere are two examples of typical weekly activities:\n\n\n  Week 3 - the experiments and analysis will present tools for finding forces by applying equilibrium, and for the design activity you will specify the size of a bolt that acts as a pin on a fold-out frame.\n  Week 6 - the experiments will explore various types of resistance to motion, the analysis will introduce concepts of work and energy, and for the design activity, you will estimate the power requirement and range of an electric car.\n\n\nA life-changing experience\n\nOn completing this course you will have:\n\n \nlearnt how to manipulate forces as vectors;\nlearnt techniques and skills in using free-body diagrams and equilibrium to analyse and predict forces;\nunderstood centres of gravity, friction and various types of resistance;\nand applied these capabilities to design.\n\n\nAnd by living in the world of the engineer, you will see how they operate effectively and safely. You will have begun to develop “Engineers’ Eyes”.\n\n\n                                    ",

How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response? How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?\nJoin us in exploring the engineering of structures around us.\n\nThe main course image, Kurilpa Bridge credited to: Alastair Smith, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\n                                    ",

Why some materials conduct heat or electricity while others are insulators?  Why adding just a small amount of carbon to iron results in an alloy that is so much stronger than the base metal?  In this course, you will learn how a material’s properties are determined by the microstructure of the material, which is in turn determined by composition and the processing that the material has undergone.\n\nThis is the second of three Coursera courses that mirror the Introduction to Materials Science class that is taken by most engineering undergrads at Georgia Tech.  The aim of the course is to help students better understand the engineering materials that are used in the world around them.  This first section covers the fundamentals of materials science including atomic structure and bonding, crystal structure, atomic and microscopic defects, and noncrystalline materials such as glasses, rubbers, and polymers.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Phase Diagrams and Phase EquilibriaThis course picks up with an overview of basic thermodynamics and kinetics as they pertain to the processing of crystalline materials.  The first module deals with phase diagrams - charts that tell us how a material will behave given a certain set of variables such as temperature, pressure, and composition.  You will learn how to interpret common and complex phase diagrams and how to extract useful information from them.Kinetics of Structural TransformationsIf thermodynamics, which we covered in the previous module, tells us how a material wants to change, then kinetics tells us how and how quickly that transformation occurs.  This module starts by explaining the driving force for phase transformations.  We will cover the nucleation and growth of precipitates, solidification, and sintering.  Finally, there are a number of lessons which apply all that has been covered in the course to understanding carbon steels.\n                                    ",

You will understand how to design robot bodies and behaviors that recruit limbs and more general appendages to apply physical forces that confer reliable mobility in a complex and dynamic world.  We develop an approach to composing simple dynamical abstractions that partially automate the generation of complicated sensorimotor programs.  Specific topics that will be covered include: mobility in animals and robots, kinematics and dynamics of legged machines, and design of dynamical behavior via energy landscapes.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction: Motivation and BackgroundWe start with a general consideration of animals, the exemplar of mobility in nature.  This leads us to adopt the stance of bioinspiration rather than biomimicry, i.e., extracting principles rather than appearances and applying them systematically to our machines. A little more thinking about typical animal mobility leads us to focus on appendages – limbs and tails – as sources of motion. The second portion of the week offers a bit of background on the physical and mathematical foundations of limbed robotic mobility. We start with a linear spring-mass-damper system and consider the second order ordinary differential equation that describes it as a first order dynamical system. We then treat the simple pendulum – the simplest revolute kinematic limb – in the same manner just to give a taste for the nature of nonlinear dynamics that inevitably arise in robotics. We’ll finish with a treatment of stability and energy basins.\n\n Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc Behavioral (Templates) &amp; Physical (Bodies)We’ll start with behavioral components that take the form of what we call “templates:” very simple mechanisms whose motions are fundamental to the more complex limbed strategies employed by animal and robot locomotors. We’ll focus on the “compass gait” (the motion of a two spoked rimless wheel) and the spring loaded inverted pendulum – the abbreviated versions of legged walkers and legged runners, respectively.We’ll then shift over to look at the physical components of mobility.  We’ll start with the notion of physical scaling laws and then review useful materials properties and their associated figures of merit. We’ll end with a brief but crucial look at the science and technology of actuators – the all important sources of the driving forces and torques in our robots. \n\nLink to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc Anchors: Embodied BehaviorsNow we’ll put physical links and joints together and consider the geometry and the physics required to understand their coordinated motion. We’ll learn about the geometry of degrees of freedom. We’ll then go back to Newton and learn a compact way to write down the physical dynamics that describes the positions, velocities and accelerations of those degrees of freedom when forced by our actuators.Of course there are many different ways to put limbs and bodies together: again, the animals can teach us a lot as we consider the best morphology for our limbed robots. Sprawled posture runners like cockroaches have six legs which typically move in a stereotyped pattern which we will consider as a model for a hexapedal machine.  Nature’s quadrupeds have their own varied gait patterns which we will match up to various four-legged robot designs as well. Finally, we’ll consider bipedal machines, and we’ll take the opportunity to distinguish human-like robot bipeds that are almost foredoomed to be slow quasi-static machines from a number of less animal-like bipedal robots whose embrace of bioinspired principles allows them to be fast runners and jumpers. \n\nLink to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc Composition (Programming Work)We now introduce the concept of dynamical composition, reviewing two types: a composition in time that we term “sequential”;  and composition in space that we call “parallel.” We’ll put a bit more focus into that last concept, parallel composition and review what has been done historically, and what can be guaranteed mathematically when the simple templates of week 2 are tasked to worked together “in parallel” on variously more complicated morphologies. The final section of this week’s lesson brings you to the horizons of research into legged mobility. We give examples of how the same composition can be anchored in different bodies, and, conversely, how the same body can be made to run using different compositions. We will conclude with a quick look at the ragged edge of what is known about transitional behaviors such as leaping.\n\n Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc \n                                    ",

In this week, you will be introduced to the exciting field of Unmanned Aerial Robotics (UAVs) and quadrotors in particular. You will learn about their basic mechanics and control strategies and realize how careful component selection and design affect the vehicles' performance. This week also provides you with instructions on how to download and install Matlab. This software will be used throughout this course in exercises and assignments, so it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Matlab soon. Tutorials to help you get started are also provided in this week.Geometry and MechanicsWelcome to Week 2 of the Robotics: Aerial Robotics course! We hope you are having a good time and learning a lot already! In this week, we will first focus on the kinematics of quadrotors. Then, you will learn how to derive the dynamic equations of motion for quadrotors. To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed in supplementary material lectures. In this week, you will also complete your first programming assignment on 1-D quadrotor control. If you have not done so already, please download, install, and learn about Matlab before starting the assignment.Planning and ControlWelcome to Week 3! We have developed planar and three-dimensional dynamic models of the quadrotor. This week, you will learn more about how to develop linear controllers for these models. With this knowledge, you will be required to complete the second programming assignment of this course, which focuses on controlling the quadrotor in two dimensions. We encourage you to start working on the assignment soon. This week ends with a discussion on motion planning for quadrotors. Advanced TopicsWelcome to Week 4! So far, we have gone over the basics of developing linear controllers for quadrotors and motion planning. In this last week of the course, we will discuss some more advanced material on how to enable quadrotors to perform more agile maneuvers and to operate autonomously in teams. Note that the last programming assignment on quadrotor control in three dimensions uses material from the previous weeks.

In this course we will consider the problem of how a robot decides what to do to achieve its goals. This problem is often referred to as Motion Planning and it has been formulated in various ways to model different situations.  You will learn some of the most common approaches to addressing this problem including graph-based methods, randomized planners and artificial potential fields.  Throughout the course, we will discuss the aspects of the problem that make planning challenging.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction and Graph-based Plan MethodsWelcome to Week 1! In this module, we will introduce the problem of planning routes through grids where the robot can only take on discrete positions. We can model these situations as graphs where the nodes correspond to the grid locations and the edges to routes between adjacent grid cells. We present a few algorithms that can be used to plan paths between a start node and a goal node including the breadth first search or grassfire algorithm, Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A Star procedure.Configuration SpaceWelcome to Week 2! In this module, we begin by introducing the concept of configuration space which is a mathematical tool that we use to think about the set of positions that our robot can attain. We then discuss the notion of configuration space obstacles which are regions in configuration space that the robot cannot take on because of obstacles or other impediments. This formulation allows us to think about path planning problems in terms of constructing trajectories for a point through configuration space. \nWe also describe a few approaches that can be used to discretize the continuous configuration space into graphs so that we can apply graph-based tools to solve our motion planning problems.Sampling-based Planning Methods Welcome to Week 3! In this module, we introduce the concept of sample-based path planning techniques. These involve sampling points randomly in the configuration space and then forging collision free edges between neighboring sample points to form a graph that captures the structure of the robots configuration space. We will talk about Probabilistic Road Maps and Randomly Exploring Rapid Trees (RRTs) and their application to motion planning problems.Artificial Potential Field MethodsWelcome to Week 4, the last week of the course! Another approach to motion planning involves constructing artificial potential fields which are designed to attract the robot to the desired goal configuration and repel it from configuration space obstacles. The robot’s motion can then be guided by considering the gradient of this potential function. In this module we will illustrate these techniques in the context of a simple two dimensional configuration space.\n                                    ",

Learn the benefits and limitations of fluid power, how to analyze fluid power components and circuits, and how to design and simulate fluid power circuits for applications.\n\nIn this course, you will be introduced to the fundamental principles and analytical modeling of fluid power components, circuits, and systems.\n\nYou will learn the benefits and limitations of fluid power compared with other power transmission technologies;  the operation, use, and symbols of common hydraulic components; how to formulate and analyze models of hydraulic components and circuits; and how to design and predict the performance of fluid power circuits.\n\nThis course is supported by the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power, and is endorsed by the National Fluid Power Association, the leading industry trade group in fluid power.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Fundamentals of Fluid PowerThis week: An overview of the course, introduction to hydraulics and pneumatics, and introduction to fundamental concepts of fluid power through the cylinder. Week 2: Components and Concepts: Part 1This week: circuit diagrams, the written language of fluid power, and how fluid flows through conduits.  We hope that you find the hydraulic circuits on the mowing machine as interesting as we did.Week 3: Components and Concepts: Part 2This will be a busy week diving into valves and pumps. We will discuss how basic valves function, how to use them in hydraulic circuits, and how to calculate pressure drop for a given flow rate, or vice versa. The videos will directly address the discussion on the forum about seeing hydraulic components working in real world circuits. In our discussion of pumps we will look at many different positive displacement pumps, exploring flow ripple and pump efficiency, look at the supporting components that form a hydraulic power supply, and see how we can make a transmission with a hydraulic pump and a motor. We are now into the heart of this course; we hope you enjoy seeing the components come together into useful circuits.Week 4: Predicting Performance Through SimulationThis week is entirely devoted to you learning how to use Simscape Fluids (formerly SimHydraulics), the fluid power simulation application that we use in the course. The lecture provides an introduction to computer-based, object-oriented simulation, and goes through a demo of using Simscape Fluids. The homework assignment contains the real work because this is where you will learn to use Simscape Fluids. The homework ends with an open-ended problem that encourages you to branch out on your own and create and run simulations based on examples listed in the course Simscape Fluids resource page or on any other fluid power system that interests you. We will be monitoring the discussion boards to help you with any technical problems with Simscape Fluids. \n*NOTE: The lecture videos were created using an earlier version of SimHydraulics; some small difference exist with the most recent version of Simscape Fluids, but the general approach is the same. \n*THERE IS NO QUIZ THIS WEEK as we recognize that a few of you may not be able to get Simscape Fluids running on your computer. Happy simulating!  Week 5: Fluid PropertiesThis week we will take a dive into hydraulic fluids (no pun intended) and how their properties and behavior influence the circuit operation.  In the lectures, you will see the water hammer effect and explore the assumption of fluid incompressibility.  We encourage you to use your new knowledge of fluid behavior and simulation to create virtual experiments that explore how fluid properties influence the behavior of a circuit.  Share your observations on the discussion forum.Week 6: Advanced Components and Systems and Course SummaryThis week you will learn about two new components, the accumulator, which stores hydraulic energy, and the servo valve, which provides fast and precise flow control. We will then be pulling together topics from throughout the course to look at servo hydraulic systems and hydraulic hybrid vehicles. You will get a chance to use simulation to explore how these advanced systems function and how the behavior of individual components influences the system operation.\n                                    ",

You’ll develop an understanding of the representation of pose and motion, kinematics, dynamics and control. You’ll also be introduced to the variety of robots and the diversity of tasks to which this knowledge and skills can be applied, the role of robots in society, and associated ethical issues. If you have access to a Lego Mindstorms kit (9797) you will be able to build a simple robot arm and write the control software for it. \r\n \r\nCombined with the Robotic Vision MOOC, this course is based on a 13 week undergraduate course Introduction to Robotics at the Queensland University of Technology.\r\n \r\nCourse Outcomes\r\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\r\n\r\ndescribe and explain what robots are and what they can do\r\ndescribe mathematically the position and orientation of objects and how they move\r\ndescribe mathematically the relationship between robot joint coordinates and robot tool pose\r\ndesign a robot joint control system and understand the nature of the rigid-body forces acting on a robot arm (optional advanced material)\r\nreflect on the future role and development of robots in human society\r\napply the mathematical, algorithmic and control principles of robot arm manipulators to implement a working robot through physical construction and software development (applies to optional project)\r\n\r\n \r\nPathways through the course\r\nYou can follow three paths through the MOOC:\r\n\r\nYou can audit the course: Register and have access to all the content, lectures, quizzes and programming assignments which you can view at your leisure. You do not necessarily have to submit the assessments. You will not receive a certificate at the end of the course.\r\nTo receive a certificate of completion you should register for the course, study all the content and successfully complete at least four assessable quizzes and four programming assignments.\r\nAn additional option is to complete a robot building project which will be peer assessed.\r\n\r\n \r\nWorkload\r\nYou should spend about 4–8 hours per week on this course. Depending on your level of skill with MATLAB and programming in general, your studies might include:\r\n\r\n2 hours viewing the lecture videos and completing the self-assessment quizzes;\r\n30 minutes for each of six weekly assessable quizzes\r\n2 hours for each of six weekly programming assignments;\r\n1–2 hours building the robot or vision system (optional project) or doing further research and/or communicating on forums.\r\n\r\n \r\nTime required for the last two items will depend on your level of skill with MATLAB and programming in general.\r\n  Certificate of Achievement\r\nThroughout the course you will be asked to complete quizzes and programming exercises. These will be automatically marked. If you pass 4 quizzes and 4 programming assignments you will receive a Certificate of Achievement. The programming assignments will consist of several MATLAB tasks and will be based on the lecture content for that week.\r\nThe robot project will be peer assessed but doesn’t count towards the Certificate of Completion.\r\n  Assumed knowledge\r\nTo complete the MOOC you should know some basic programming (either of MATLAB or of an object-oriented programming language) and some of the following areas of maths: matrices, vectors and spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We’ve included links to Khan Academy on these topics. We believe this knowledge will be necessary to complete the course, and recommend that you view these before Week 1 begins, but you might prefer to watch them on an ‘as needed’ basis after you view our content.\r\n \r\n\r\nVectors\r\nMatrices:\r\n\r\nbasic matrix operations including multiplication and inversion\r\nzero and identity matrices\r\nvector transformations with matrices\r\nfamiliarity with the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nNote: A free version of MATLAB will be available for the duration of the course. Also, Professor Corke’s textbook (not essential) will be available at a significant discount.\r\n  Requirements Hardware\r\n\r\nComputer: You will need a computer that is capable of running MATLAB. For System Requirements, visit the MathWorks’ System Requirements page.\r\nLego Mindstorms: To complete the optional project part of this course you will need access to a robotics development kit – we work with Lego Mindstorms NXT and EV3 kits (approximately $300 to $500 depending on the source. Alternatively you can use an Arbotix based design which uses Dynamixel servos, 3D printed parts and an Arbotix microcontroller controller board.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoftware\r\n\r\nMATLAB. This is a proprietary technical computing and visualisation package developed by The Mathworks Inc. It is widely used in the engineering industry, in scientific research and for undergraduate education. MATLAB is a core part of the course and is available for free to students studying this course. It is used to illustrate techniques in the lectures (via screencasts) and also for the assignment (you need to write programs and submit them for automatic grading). A free MATLAB licence and software for installation will be available when you enrol in the course.\r\nOpen source toolboxes for MATLAB. These will also be available from the course site.\r\nFor the robot project, RWTH Mindstorms NXT Toolbox, open source from the Mindstorms website.\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\nTextbook (optional). Access to the textbook written by Professor Peter Corke (2011), Robotics, Vision and Control: Fundamental Algorithms in MATLAB (Springer) is optional, but considered beneficial.\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This week we will look at where the idea of robots has come from, and the difference between fictional and real robots. We’ll look at a number of useful real world robots and what they do. Then we get started on the problem of describing where things are in the world. It’s critical to know where a robot is, and where are the things that it needs to deal with. We’ll start simply and consider the case of objects in a 2-dimensional plane. The skills you’ll learn and the tools we’ll use will be essential for the MATLAB assignments and the project.\r\n\r\nLecture 1: Introduction\r\nLecture 2: Where things are in 2D\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 2\r\nThis week we talk about how to describe the position and orientation, the pose, of objects in 3 dimensions, which is considerably more difficult than the 2-dimensional case. We also discuss how we can compute object poses that change smoothly with time, for instance to guide the arm of a robot from one pose to another.\r\n\r\nLecture 3: Where things are in 3D\r\nLecture 4: Time varying coordinate frames\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 3\r\nThis week we’ll finish our introduction to the fundamentals of describing pose by talking about how we can measure the motion of objects moving in the 3-dimensional world using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Then we’ll get started with robot arms and how to describe the 3D-pose of the robot’s gripper, or end-effector, given knowledge of its structure and its joint angles.\r\n\r\nLecture 5: Measuring the motion of things\r\nLecture 6: Robot arms &amp; forward kinematics\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 4\r\nThis week we consider the inverse problem to the last lecture, if we know the pose of the end robot’s end-effector how do we work out what the joint angles should be. Then we consider the relationship between the velocity of the joints and the velocity of the end-effector, which raises the issue of how to describe the rate of change of pose. To keep things simple we consider the 2-dimensional case.\r\n\r\nLecture 7: Inverse kinematics &amp; robot motion\r\nLecture 8: Robot velocity in 2D: introducing the manipulator Jacobian\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 5\r\nThis week we finish off our discussion of robot kinematics by extending what we learnt in the last lecture, for 2-dimensions, and consider how to describe the rate of change of 3D-pose which turns out to be a six-dimensional vector. So far we have just assumed that robot joints can be set to some particular angle, now it’s time to consider the underlying mechatronic system and control theory that enables this to happen.\r\n\r\nLecture 9: Robot velocity in 3D\r\nLecture 10: Robot joint control\r\n\r\n \r\nWeek 6\r\nThis week we extend the work of the last lecture to consider other forces that act on a robot arm and can effect the joint control system, for example gravity, friction and inertia. We finish with a discussion about the future of robotics, where the technology is headed, how robots can help solve some of the big problems facing our societies, and some ethical considerations that arise from the application of robotics.\r\n\r\nLecture 11: Rigid body dynamics\r\nLecture 12: The future of robots\r\n\n                                    ",

In lesson one, you will learn to recognize the six categories of engineering materials through examples from everyday life, and we’ll discuss how the structure of those materials leads to their properties. Lesson two explores how point defects explain solid state diffusion. We will illustrate crystallography – the atomic-scale arrangement of atoms that we can see with the electron microscope. We will also describe the Arrhenius Relationship, and apply it to the number of vacancies in a crystal. We’ll finish by discussing how point defects facilitate solid state diffusion, and applying the Arrhenius Relationship to solid state diffusion.Dislocations Explain Plastic Deformation / Stress vs. Strain -The “Big Four” Mechanical PropertiesWelcome to week 2! In lesson three we will discover how dislocations at the atomic-level structure of materials explain plastic (permanent) deformation. You will learn to define a linear defect and see how materials deform through dislocation motion. Lesson four compares stress versus strain, and introduces the “Big Four” mechanical properties of elasticity, yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility. You’ll assess what happens beyond the tensile strength of an object. And you’ll learn about a fifth important property – toughness.Creep Deformation / The Ductile-to-Brittle TransitionWelcome to week 3! In lesson five we’ll explore creep deformation and learn to analyze a creep curve.  We’ll apply the Arrhenius Relationship to creep deformation and identify the mechanisms of creep deformation. In lesson six we find that the phenomenon of ductile-to-brittle transition is related to a particular crystal structure (the body-centered cubic). We’ll also learn to plot the ductile-to-brittle transition for further analysis.Fracture Toughness / FatigueWelcome to week 4! In lesson seven we will examine the concept of critical flaws. We’ll define fracture toughness and critical flaw size with the design plot. We’ll also distinguish how we break things in good and bad ways. Lesson eight explores the concept of fatigue in engineering materials. We’ll define fatigue and examine the fatigue curve and fatigue strength. We’ll also identify mechanisms of fatigue.Making Things Fast and Slow / A Brief History of SemiconductorsWelcome to week 5! In lesson nine we’ll deal with how to make things fast and slow. We’ll examine the lead-tin phase diagram and look at its practical applications as an example of making something slowly. Then we’ll evaluate the TTT diagram for eutectoid steel, and compare diffusional to diffusionless transformations with the TTT diagram, monitoring how we make things rapidly. Lesson ten is a brief history of semiconductors. Here, we discuss the role of semiconductor materials in the modern electronics industry. Our friend Arrhenius is back again, and this time we’re applying the Arrhenius Relationship to both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. We’ll also look at combined intrinsic and extrinsic behavior.\n                                    ",

The Gaussian distribution is the most widely used continuous distribution and provides a useful way to estimate uncertainty and predict in the world. We will start by discussing the one-dimensional Gaussian distribution, and then move on to the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Finally, we will extend the concept to models that use Mixtures of Gaussians.Bayesian Estimation - Target TrackingWe will learn about the Gaussian distribution for tracking a dynamical system. We will start by discussing the dynamical systems and their impact on probability distributions. This linear Kalman filter system will be described in detail, and, in addition, non-linear filtering systems will be explored.MappingWe will learn about robotic mapping. Specifically, our goal of this week is to understand a mapping algorithm called Occupancy Grid Mapping based on range measurements. Later in the week, we introduce 3D mapping as well.Bayesian Estimation - LocalizationWe will learn about robotic localization. Specifically, our goal of this week is to understand a how range measurements, coupled with odometer readings, can place a robot on a map.

In this module, we will study how images and videos acquired by cameras mounted on robots are transformed into representations like features and optical flow.  Such 2D representations allow us then to extract 3D information about where the camera is and in which direction the robot moves.  You will come to understand how grasping objects is facilitated by the computation of 3D posing of objects and navigation can be accomplished by visual odometry and landmark-based localization.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Geometry of Image FormationWelcome to Robotics: Perception! We will begin this course with a tutorial on the standard camera models used in computer vision. These models allow us to understand, in a geometric fashion, how light from a scene enters a camera and projects onto a 2D image. By defining these models mathematically, we will be able understand exactly how a point in 3D corresponds to a point in the image and how an image will change as we move a camera in a 3D environment. In the later modules, we will be able to use this information to perform complex perception tasks such as reconstructing 3D scenes from video.Projective TransformationsNow that we have a good camera model, we will explore the geometry of perspective projections in depth.  We will find that this projection is the cause of the main challenge in perception, as we lose a dimension that we can no longer directly observe. In this module, we will learn about several properties of projective transformations in depth, such as vanishing points, which allow us to infer complex information beyond our basic camera model.Pose EstimationIn this module we will be learning about feature extraction and pose estimation from two images. We will learn how to find the most salient parts of an image and track them across multiple frames (i.e. in a video sequence). We will then learn how to use features to find the position of the camera with respect to another reference frame on a plane using Homographies. We will also learn about how to make these techniques more robust, using least squares to hand noisy feature points or RANSAC to remove completely erroneous feature points.Multi-View GeometryNow we will use what we learned from two view geometry and extend it to sequences of images, such as a video. We will explain the fundamental geometric constraints between point features in images, the Epipolar constraint, and learn how to use it to extract the relative poses between multiple frames. We will finish by combining all this information together for the application of Structure from Motion, where we will compute the trajectory of a camera and a map throughout many frames and refine our estimates using Bundle adjustment.\n                                    ",

The Horse Course will cover many unique aspects of equine ownership and touch upon the science behind many of today’s management practices.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to The Horse CourseWelcome to Week 1 of The Horse Course! To start off the course, we will begin discussing what exactly an “equid” is. We will cover the many equine species inhabiting our globe. Next, we’ll jump into the history of horses and donkeys, touching upon how they have made such an impact on our own societal development. The second half of week 1 will cover the many breeds of horses and donkeys. We will finish up with a lecture on the equine hybrids.Basic Equine PhysiologyThis week will start out with covering some basic physiology. We will then advance into hoof anatomy and care. This will lead to spending a lecture discussing laminitis, a serious hoof condition in horses and other equids. The final two lectures will jump into the various coat colors and markings in horses.Equine Behavior and TrainingThe topics this week will focus on equid behavior and movement. Understanding how equids relate to their environment and communicate is critical to training and management. We will start this week by examining the basic equine senses and communication. Then we will discuss normal and abnormal behaviors and the basic psychology used in training. We will finish the week discussing the basic gaits and how these animals move.Feeding ManagementThe topics this week will focus on equid nutrition. Understanding how and what to feed these animals is one of the most important aspects of basic care. We will start with digestive anatomy, how to evaluate your animal’s nutrient requirements, and then jump into feeding management. We will round out the week discussing colic and other nutritional disorders.Maintaining Equine HealthThe topics this week will focus on equine health. Monitoring and taking care of your animal’s health is critical to owning any equid. We will start off with the normal equine vital signs and then we will discuss administering first aid to your animals. We will then cover the different parasites and diseases that can afflict these animals. Finally, we will end the week discussing some common genetic disorders.Breeding ManagementThe topics this week will focus on equine reproduction. Breeding is an important component of the equine industry. We will start off this week with some basic anatomy, including what makes the equids unique. Then we will cover the estrous cycles of mares and jennies, followed by common breeding systems used throughout the world. After discussing unique aspects of equine pregnancy and parturition, we will finish out the week covering some management tips for taking care of the newborn foal.\n                                    ",

Only 15% leave because they feel they are not good enough. Almost 70% leave because they were not having fun, or due to problems with the coach. Injuries cause 30% to give up sports. This course is packed full of practical sports science information that provide youth coaches and parents with the practical pediatric sports science insights to successfully retain young athletes and develop their sport potential while avoiding injury and overtraining. We begin by examining the multidimensional nature of coaching, the relevant sport motor performance abilities, the impact of growth and development on motor skills, the gene versus practice controversy, and briefly overview the body structures strengthened through training. Then we explore the athlete's energy supply, where this energy comes from, and how it matures along with the athlete. Finally, we examine the development of strength, power, anaerobic capacity, coordination and flexibility through the life span.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to the young athleteYouth coaches who have a sound understanding of pediatric sports science are essential to the successful development of a young athlete’s sport potential. In this section you are introduced to the multidimensional nature of coaching, and how an athlete’s motor abilities of endurance, strength, speed, coordination and flexibility are affected by growth and maturation.Week 2: Strategies for maximizing the athlete’s potential Many factors can positively and negatively impact the young athlete’s ability to optimize their sports potential.  In this section we examine strategies for ensuring the athlete’s systematic long-term sports development and how to mold the correct sport-specific phenotype.Week 3: How the body worksThe coach is a microbiologist who designs training so it stimulates the body’s cells and structures to become stronger and more efficient. In this section you are introduced to key organ systems, and the energy these organ systems use to run the chemical reactions needed for a sports performance. You will also learn how diet can positively enhance an athlete’s ability to train and compete. Week 4: Enhancing the athlete’s physical work capacityThe level of expertise with which an athlete is able to perform sports skill depends on how well the coach molds the correct ratio of endurance, strength, power and speed to meet the demands of the sport. In this section you will learn the science behind developing these important motor performance abilities as the young athlete moves through puberty.Week 5: Enhancing the fluidity of movementCoordination and flexibility permit movements that are precise, fluid and spatially controlled. In this section we examine current knowledge about coordination and flexibility as the young child moves early childhood and into adolescence.\n                                    ",

In this course, you’ll learn how to design experiments, how to run experiments, and how to analyze data from these experiments in order to evaluate and validate user experiences. You will work through real-world examples of experiments from the fields of IxD and HCI, understanding issues in experiment design and analysis. You will analyze multiple data sets using recipes given to you in the R statistical programming language -- no prior programming experience is assumed or required. By the end of the course, you will be able to knowledgeably design, run, and analyze your own experiments for putting empirical and statistical weight behind your designs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Basic Experiment Design ConceptsIn this module, you will learn basic concepts relevant to the design and analysis of experiments, including mean comparisons, variance, statistical significance, practical significance, sampling, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and informed consent. You’ll also learn to think of an experiment in terms of its participants, apparatus, procedure, and design &amp; analysis. This module covers lecture videos 1-2.User Preferences: Tests of ProportionsIn this module, you will learn how to analyze user preferences (or other tallies) using tests of proportions. You will also get up and running with R and RStudio. Topics covered include independent and dependent variables, variable types, exploratory data analysis, p-values, asymptotic tests, exact tests, one-sample tests, two-sample tests, Chi-Square test, G-test, Fisher’s exact test, binomial test, multinomial test, post hoc tests, and pairwise comparisons. This module covers lecture videos 3-9.Website A/B Tests: The T-TestIn this module, you will learn how to design and analyze a simple website A/B test. Topics include measurement error, independent variables as factors, factor levels, between-subjects factors, within-subjects factors, dependent variables as responses, response types, balanced designs, and how to report a t-test. You will perform your first analysis of variance in the form of an independent-samples t-test.
