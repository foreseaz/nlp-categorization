After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",

    "description": "Colossal pyramids, imposing temples, golden treasures, enigmatic hieroglyphs, powerful pharaohs, strange gods, and mysterious mummies are features of Ancient Egyptian culture that have fascinated people over the millennia.  The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.\n\nAs the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.\n\nJoin Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.

    "description": "This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.\n\nKnowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

    "description": "Ce cours propose une introduction à la protection internationale des droits de l’homme. Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect. \n\nDepuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.\n\nLe présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?\n\nEn abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.\n\nLe cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.\n\nLe cours est donné en français. Il consiste en une série de 8 sessions, comprenant chacune un certain nombre de brèves présentations vidéo (8 à 15 minutes). Chaque session s'accompagne d'un questionnaire d'évaluation. Des lectures préparatoires sont requises pour chaque session.",

Following a first week delving into some foundational concepts for successful character design, each of the remaining three weeks are structured as a \"master class\" where you will observe three professional character designers at work in the studio: Andy Ristaino (Adventure Time), Jacky Ke Jiang (Journey), and Robertryan Cory (SpongeBob SquarePants). Each designer will take on two different design challenges on the fly and address the various issues in designing characters for games, such as movement, expression, and technical limitations. At the end of each week you will have an opportunity to try out some of the concepts from that week's lesson on characters of your own design. \n\nThis is a fun and engaging class especially useful for students interested in animation in film and TV as well as games, and is suitable for students of any drawing ability.",

    "description": "The Beginning Game Programming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!",

    "description": "What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?\n\nThis is surely one of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nTill recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? (and about which you can find out more at http://deepredink.com/demos/happysmarts/books.php) can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (“Dr. Happiness”),\n      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren’t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could—or should—be\n      - What are the “7 Deadly Happiness Sins” that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are the “7 Habits of the Highly Happy” and how can you implement them in your life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.",

    "description": "This course introduces you to the nonprofit sector, nonprofit organizations, and the concepts of leadership and governance. While this course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that in other parts of the world the nature of the nonprofit sector, nonprofit organizations, nonprofit leadership and governance may not be the same. Nevertheless, it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/Lvhdqi.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 1 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

    "description": "Clinical trials are experiments designed to evaluate new interventions to prevent or treat disease in humans. The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.\nThe course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs. We will also explain some of the mechanics of clinical trials, like randomization and blinding of treatment. In the second half of the course, we will explain how clinical trials are analyzed and interpreted. Finally, we will review the essential ethical consideration involved in conducting experiments on people.",

    "description": "In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public’s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of ‘community’ and the processes by which we ‘diagnose’ or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities.\n\nAn appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.",

    "description": "We make thousands of decisions every day. Do I cross the road now, or wait for the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices. Learn how to improve your spending, saving, and investing decisions for the future.",

Experts agree that twentieth-century leadership practices are inadequate for the stormy twenty-first-century present. This provocative course equips you with the insights you'll need to rise with the occasion of a rapidly shifting business landscape.\n\nThe course is based on a book, Harder Than I Thought: Adventures of a 21st Century Leader, by Robert D.

    "description": "Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural progression, the online course has been separated into 3 units, this is Unit 1.",

Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology—but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We’ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We’ll peek into the  rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We’ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we’ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating  in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other  page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.",

It shows that rather than develop into a full blown market economy, state and party officials at all levels of the political system maintain significant influence in economic development. Such a “political” economy has had both positive and negative outcomes, which we will assess in detail. We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future. The course is a quite useful background for Chinese Politics Part 2 – China and the World.\n\nPlease note that this course currently does not offer certificate.",

Global health, once merely an ethical consideration, now dominates discussions and policies of global security. A diverse team of experts in this emerging field has come together to help you contextualize your experiences as a new or seasoned global health responder. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be enlightened about the changing world you live in, and have a much better understanding of the machinations on how organizations and governments are striving to improve health worldwide.  You'll also learn how to keep yourself safe and be a savvy participant in the global health arena. You'll be prepared to travel and to take your skills to chronic/emergent situations and help respond to the pressing needs while participating in global health activities throughout the world.\n\nWeek one will serve as an introduction to global health concepts with a look at changing trends in the 21st century; urbanization, environmental stress and resource scarcity. During week two, we will dive into global health security: food, water, energy, and the threats of a changing climate. Week three will cover the global burden of disease, infectious disease, the rise of non-communicable diseases, mental health, and access to care. During week four, we will learn about the stakeholders in global health: NGOs, governments, non-state actors; understanding where the money comes from, how it is allocated and the challenges of measuring results; human rights: what are they and how are they protected? During week five, we move onto complex humanitarian emergencies: forced migrations, wars, response standards, and the legal basis for interventions. Finally, during week six, we will end our course by learning how to be an effective participant--caring for yourself: pre-travel preparation, understanding risks when traveling outside your home country, and physiologic vulnerability.\n\nThis course also serves as a prerequisite to the hands-on 'Global Health Responder' certification from the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

Il est scindé un deux MOOCs. Dans la première partie, le Professeur J.-Ph. Ansermet de l’EPFL et son collaborateur le Dr. Sylvain Bréchet ont rassemblé en quatre leçons tous les principes fondamentaux de la thermodynamique.  La deuxième partie du MOOC illustre l’approche thermodynamique par une série d’applications présentées par des spécialistes provenant de diverses institutions partenaires du réseau RESCIF. \n\nL’objectif du cours est la compréhension et la capacité de mise en application des concepts fondamentaux de la thermodynamique. Après la présentation du premier et deuxième principe de la thermodynamique, l’exposé abordera les questions d’irréversibilité ainsi que les potentiels thermodynamiques. \n\nAprès l’établissement de ces bases conceptuelles, leurs applications à l’ingénierie tels que les transferts thermiques, la calorimétrie et les transitions de phases, seront traitées. Ensuite le point de vue de la chimie sera présenté pour aborder la conversion de l’énergie chimique en électricité. Finalement, des sujets plus avancés seront abordés, à savoir les cycles thermodynamiques, les machines thermiques, les concepts de thermodynamique adaptés au milieu continu et finalement les processus de transports.\n\nLe professeur J.-Ph. Ansermet qui est l’instigateur de ce cours s’est entouré d’experts et de spécialistes des différents domaines d’application enseignant la thermodynamique dans diverses institutions partenaires du réseau RESCIF, c’est à dire  le Professeur Michael Grätzel et  le docteur Sylvain Brechet de l’EPFL,  les Professeurs Paul Ekam, Théophile Mband, Marthe Boyomo et André Talla de l’ENSP de Yaoundé, le professeur Miltiadis Papalexandris de UCL à Louvain, le Professeur Etienne Robert du Polytechnique de Montréal,  les Professeurs Marwan Brouche et Chantal Maatouk de l’Université St-Joseph de Beyrouth.",

We will also analyze monopolies from an efficiency perspective and look at the effects of imperfect information on firm and consumer behavior. We will next turn to exploring input markets and what determines the demand for an input by a firm, an industry, and the overall market. We will also look at the factors that affect input supply and how the supply of an input interacts with demand to determinant input prices. We will use input market theory to analyze institutions and government policies such as the NCAA sports cartel, the minimum wage, Social Security, and immigration. Finally, we will address the concept of market efficiency and what government can do to promote it as well as how government intervention may diminish it.",

These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now!\n\nThe five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world – including successes and failures – through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too.  \n\nWhy?\n\nMore than two generations ago, the venture capital community – VC’s, business angels, incubators, and others – convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they’ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. \n\nBut the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow?\n\nYou’ll be asked to do a series of exercises – out in the real world – to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive – without venture capital. You’ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today’s fast-paced lifestyles, we’ve broken what you’ll get – short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking questions, even some optional things to read – into bite-sized chunks, so you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.",

    "description": "The Holocaust was an inconceivable historical event, which forever robbed Western culture of its innocence. As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Center for Holocaust Research. The course tracks the history of the Holocaust and has two parts. \"The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World\" is the first of the two courses and covers the following themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: From Hatred to Core Ideology\nWe will try to delve into Nazi ideology and the special place of Jews and Judaism in it. We will also discuss how the National Socialist Party converted the German Democracy of the Weimar Republic into a totalitarian regime within a short period of time, and its meaning for Jews and non-Jewish citizens.\n\nWeek 2: The World and the Jews in World War II\nWe will try to examine the broader contexts of the Holocaust and to place it, as part of World War 2. In this meeting we will also refer to the vital Jewish world to be found under various Nazi occupations and influences.\n\nWeek 3: The Isolation Abyss - the Perspective of the Individual\nWe will try to reveal different aspects of Jewish life in the face of the badge of shame, ghettos and segregation, as well as the formation of individual, societies’ and leader’s reactions in the face of a consistent policy of dispossession and discrimination.\n\nOnce you’ve completed this course, you can continue your learning with The Holocaust - An Introduction (II): The Final Solution\n\n\nThis online course is offered in an innovative, multi-level format, comprising:\n\n* Comprehensive lectures by leading researchers from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem.\n* A wealth of voices and viewpoints presented by guest lecturers.\n* Numerous documents, photos, testimonies and works of art from the time of the Holocaust.\n* Novel learning experience: Crowd sourcing – involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nThis course is designed for anyone with an interest in the Holocaust, including students, teachers, academics and policy-makers.",

Understanding these principles is crucial to the process of creating efficient and well-structured solutions for computational problems.  To get hands-on experience working with these concepts, we will use the Python programming language. The main focus of the class will be weekly mini-projects that build upon the mathematical and programming principles that are taught in the class. To keep the class fun and engaging, many of the projects will involve working with strategy-based games.\n\nIn part 2 of this course,  the programming portion of the class will focus on concepts such as recursion, assertions, and invariants. The mathematical portion of the class will focus on searching, sorting, and recursive data structures.  Upon completing this course, you will have a solid foundation in the principles of computation and programming.  This will prepare you for the next course in the specialization, which will begin to introduce a structured approach to developing and analyzing algorithms.  Developing such algorithmic thinking skills will be critical to writing large scale software and solving real world computational problems.",

There are great textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most of those resources require some background knowledge. This course is designed to help the novice who wants to gain confidence and knowledge. We will explore the theory (what actually happens when you click on a link on a webpage?), the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and the overlooked (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic standards to promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities.  The textbook we use is available online, “The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming” by Michael Mendez from www.opensuny.org. \n\nThis course will appeal to a wide variety of people, but specifically those who would like a step-by-step description of the basics. There are no prerequisites for this course and it is assumed that students have no prior programming skills or IT experience. The course will culminate in a small final project that will require the completion of a very simple page with links and images. The focus of this course is on the basics, not appearance. You can see a sample final page at http://intro-webdesign.com/html5-plain.html.  \n\nThis is the first course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization. Subsequent courses focus on the marketable skills of styling the page with CSS3, adding interactivity with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.

In the initial years of the opening, external forces influenced China’s economy, regional balances, bureaucracy, as well as the political authority of local leaders in the coastal areas. More recently, the world is feeling the effects of a rising China which seeks resources and talent from all around the globe and uses its financial wealth to strengthen its position in the world. This course tracks the opening of China up from 1978 until it joins the WTO, focusing on how the world affected China’s internal development. We then look at various aspects of China’s “going out strategy” — its search for energy, talent, as well as its relations with the United States and the states within the Asia-Pacific region. The instructor has been deeply engaged in research on all these topics, having lived in China during various stages of China’s opening to the outside world.\n\nPlease note that this course currently does not offer certificate.",

    "description": "Welcome to Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies. Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to enhance memory function, especially as we get older. Rather than covering all aspects of human memory, I will provide an introduction to the scientific study of memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold widespread popular appeal. \n\nAll of my lectures will describe what has been learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background in psychology. To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous films to illustrate different aspects of memory. Many of us love watching movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them with an educated eye. \n\nThis course is based on my new book from MIT Press - Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory. While it is not required for the course, it can enhance your understanding of memory by providing a thorough coverage of the topics that I describe as well as additional fascinating aspects of memory covered only in the book. This book is available in either hardcopy or ebook form and MIT Press is offering a 30% discount off the cover price by using discount code MMAM30 at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/memory-and-movies.\n\nWelcome once more. I am looking forward to showing you what films can teach us about memory.",

The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\n\nGeneral Overview Help Center\n\nUrbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents). There will be also assignments that consist in participating to discussions related to theoretical models presented in the course based on case studies of your choice, and peer assessments on your contributions.\n\nSyllabus :\n\nWeek #1 : Introduction, definition, urban questions and the use of models\n\nWeek #2 : European cities and the weberian model of integration\n\nWeek #3 : Colonial and post colonial cities\n\nWeek #4 : Industrial cities (and Socialist cities) and Marxist models\n\nWeek #5 : The American metropolis and the Chicago School, \n\nWeek #6 : Post metropolis, fragments and differences\n\nWeek #7 : Global cities and mega cities\n\nWeek #8 : Smart cities and the sociology of science and technology",

It places the student experience at the centre of our endeavours by engaging learners in a range of robust and challenging discussions and exercises befitting SOAS, University of London's status as a research-intensive university and its rich research heritage.\n\nThe course will appeal to those of you who require an understanding of research approaches and skills, and importantly an ability to deploy them in your studies or in your professional lives. In particular, this course will aid those of you who have to conduct research as part of your postgraduate studies but do not perhaps have access to research methods courses, or for those of you who feel you would like additional support for self-improvement. No prior knowledge or experience in research is required to take this course and as such, the course is for everyone. \n\nThis MOOC draws on a wealth of existing course material developed to support research training across SOAS, University of London and particularly drawing from the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy (CISD). In 2015, the course was nominated for the prestigious Guardian University Award for its innovative approach to online learning.\n\nParticipation in or completion of this online course will not confer academic credit for University of London programmes",

    "description": "This course offers an introduction into the public economics theory. It does not aspire to cover theories of taxation, public expenditures, regulation etc. at length and in-depth. Rather, our ambition is to give a bird's-eye view of central themes of public economics and related disciplines, and teach concepts, logic, and ideas, rather than methods of analysis, which would require an entirely different course format.\n\nOur choice of topics covered by the course reflects a trade-off between salience and centrality, on the one hand, and suitability for a brief online introductory course, on the other. The course content is neither comprehensive (which would be a \"mission impossible\" for virtually any public economics course\"), nor representative of other such courses. With these limitations and caveats in mind, we encourage our students to continue their public economics studies in a more regular fashion, and see our role inter alia in motivating interest in such \"continued education\".\n\nThe central theme of the course is the role of government as a mechanism of resource allocation which complements and augments markets. Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government's limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society. Otherwise the course's man themes are economics of taxation, regulation, politics of public economics, incentives in government, and government vis-à-vis (civil) society.",

The concepts and skills presented throughout the courses in the specialization are applied in this capstone course where you will launch an actual business.\n\nIt will not be a business concept described on paper, but a functional business with legal status in your particular governmental jurisdiction, developed within your available resources whatever they are, and challenged to generate revenue.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of this specialization is the business development environment provided by the population of learners. At the point of the capstone course your thousands of fellow learners become consultants capable of refining and adding value to your business concept, they may also be potential customers or at the very least allow you to observe the likely reactions from potential customers.\n\nWith the experience of launching this startup, and the execution capabilities and confidence gain from that experience it is our desire that you repeat the process and launch another startup or a bigger version of this startup.

    "description": "This course is the first in a series on starting a business. Though new venture creation is the focus of the specialization, this course is important for everyone. It provides learners with insights to reframe their thinking in order to maximize their chances for success. Whether success is defined by the performance of their own venture, or by their performance within someone else’s venture. The course is as much, if not more about fulfilling one's potential as it is about one starting a business.\n\nSo what can a learner expect to gain from this course? At the end of this course a learner:\n     - will be able to argue effectively against all of the reasons for not starting their business (or reaching some goal);\n     - will be  able to operate effectively within the new framework or model for starting a business (or any new endeavor),\n        thus increasing their chances for success; and\n     - will be able to make the initial business startup decisions of what type of business to start, and what type of business \n       owner to be.\n\nIn her classic text, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Stanford Professor Carol S. Dweck presents her research showing that hard work and mindset impact success more than natural talent, and that people have the ability to choose which mindset they wish to operate from.\n\nDr. Alain Fayolle in the Financial Times defines an Entrepreneurial mindset as a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. Individuals with entrepreneurial mindsets are often drawn to opportunities, innovation and new value creation. In terms outlined by Dr. Dweck this would be a specialized growth mindset as opposed to fixed mindset.\n\nHaving an entrepreneurial mindset is critical to being successful as an entrepreneur. An entrepreneurial mindset stands alone in terms of its importance. No other attribute, personality, inherent entrepreneurial proclivities, training, or demographic profile is common to all successful entrepreneurs whether Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, or the neighborhood florist or grocer.\n\nThe course provides learners with an understanding of the attributes and perspectives of an entrepreneurial mindset, and the process to acquire one. The course introduces concepts that enables a person to start a transformative process in the way they think generally, and in the way they think about business specifically. This new way of thinking has the potential to positively impact not only them, but their family, and community.",

All these skills will help you create sense in your team so you can lead it better.\n\nThis course is part of a Specialization on Leadership called “Inspirational Leadership: Leading with Sense”, so you may want to take the course “Building Your Leadership Skills” prior of taking this course.\nAs where in course 1 “Building Your Leadership Skills” you have mostly worked on your inner-self and on the relation between you and the other, in this course you’ll work on the relationship between you and the group, improving your leadership skills when interacting in a team. \n\nLeaders from different organizations and participants of the HEC Paris Leadership Certificate, the program from which this course and specialization is inspired, will share with you their insights about what it takes to become a great leader in a group or team and what they are able to achieve now that they apply The Savoir-Relier methodology.",

Research those organizations and positions.\n\n4.  Prepare pitch sheets and J.I.S.T. cards (mini-resumes) targeting those positions.\n\n5.  Complete your resume, and if necessary complete multiple versions to target each position.\n\n6.  Write appropriate cover letters for the positions.\n\n7.  Record and evaluate responses to a set of standard interview questions.\n\n8.  Record and evaluate responses to a set of predictable behavioral interview questions.\n\n9.  Record and evaluate a response to one situational interview question.\n\n10.  Record and evaluate a response to one wild-card question.\n\nAs the specialization has focused throughout on the real-world skills you need to research yourself, the market, and a company and has given you strategies and tools to prepare for and succeed in an interview, the capstone project should align with what you have been trained for and position you to land the job you want!",

After completing this course, learners will understand the diversity of data and their management needs across the research data lifecycle, be able to identify the components of good data management plans, and be familiar with best practices for working with data including the organization, documentation, and storage and security of data. Learners will also understand the impetus and importance of archiving and sharing data as well as how to assess the trustworthiness of repositories. \n\nToday, an increasing number of funding agencies, journals, and other stakeholders are requiring data producers to share, archive, and plan for the management of their data. In order to respond to these requirements, researchers and information professionals will need the data management and curation knowledge and skills that support the long-term preservation, access, and reuse of data. Effectively managing data can also help optimize research outputs, increase the impact of research, and support open scientific inquiry. After completing this course, learners will be better equipped to manage data throughout the entire research data lifecycle from project planning to the end of the project when data ideally are shared and made available within a trustworthy repository.\n\nThis course was developed by the Curating Research Assets and Data Using Lifecycle Education (CRADLE) Project in collaboration with EDINA at the University of Edinburgh. \n\nThis course was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services under award #RE-06-13-0052-13.

    "description": "Archaeology is, among human sciences, the discipline with the strongest importance for the rediscovery, but also for the preservation and protection of cultural heritage, as Humankind’s universal patrimony. You will be introduced to the way we ourselves reflect on and are engaged with the study of human past: from the practical and material recovery of ancient traces in the field to the study and interpretation. On the other hand, the discovery of human past implies the correct conservation and presentation for both experts and general public: the study and protection of the past we share every day prevent from any possible destruction, misuse, abuse and thus cancellation of human memory.\n“Recovering the Humankind's Past and Saving the Universal Heritage” presents to a large public Archaeology as a historical discipline: through an inter-disciplinary perspective you will follow the evolution and change of archaeology to the moment when natural sciences contributed to make the historical reconstructions scientifically sound; the aid of informatics and of virtual reconstructions gives new fascination to the already strong suggestion of Archaeology, as the discipline of discovery par excellence. Within this frame, Ebla, which is the glory of the Sapienza school of Oriental archaeology, will have an exemplary meaning in the course development as a long lasting experience on the field and an excellent example of the scientific results of combined researches and disciplines.\n\nMoreover, the course will focus on actual, innovative instruments to preserve, monitor and give value to cultural heritage through a multidisciplinary approach, based on a deep archaeological and historical knowledge but also on ICT technologies. The wide adoption of ICT technologies in our daily life is also impacting in the way in which we interact with our cultural heritage in particular in terms of preservation and dissemination of cultural objects.\n\nIn this course you will  learn the basic techniques  to digitize cultural objects and obtain 3D digital copies of a physical objects such as statues, vases or archaeological sites.  We will also discuss how to structure the raw data in order to facilitate and make effective the access to digital contents. In particular, we will present the European Data Model, a framework for collecting, connecting and enriching data on cultural objects provided by a number of museum, archives, sites and libraries in Europe.",

The first course covered international courts and tribunals in The Hague in general. This second course provides an insider perspective into the work of international criminal courts and tribunals.  You will learn about the investigation and prosecution of international crimes in The Hague. \n\nAtrocities produce unspeakable forms of violence. We will explore whether and how international criminal justice contribute to what UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon called the ‘age of accountability’. The theory is, those who commit the worst of human crimes, are held accountable, whether they are rank-and-file foot soldiers or military commanders, whether they are lowly civil servants following orders or top political leaders. We will test  how this can be done and if this is realistic.\n\nDuring this course, you will be offered a look into the ‘kitchen’ of the Hague international criminal courts and tribunals. You will learn how international criminal justice functions, who the actors are, what outcomes it produces, and how it can be improved. \n\nIf you want to gain a better understanding of international criminal cases, like the Lubanga case, the ICC’s first ever trial, and the legal legacy of UN international criminal tribunals, then this course is definitely for you!\n\nThis course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option. If you want a certificate, but are unable to pay for it, you can request financial aid via Coursera.",

    "description": "Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. Learn and practice concepts, techniques, and get to grips with the latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. Analyze how firms attempt to capture value, as well as profits, in the revenues they earn. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to contribute to the process of formulating pricing strategies for your own products and services, or those of your firm. This course has an additional focus on pricing dynamics and the reaction to and by competitors, taking a highly pragmatic approach and one that is directly applicable to your day-to-day professional life.\n\nThis course is made up of the following four modules:\n\n1 - In this module we will start with the importance of pricing, especially for the bottom line. Having this in mind, and after showing how pricing is the most important driver of profitability, when you finish this module you will be able to execute cost, competition and customer-based pricing. You will also be able to use the concepts of price elasticity and optimal price while setting prices for your products and services.\n\n2 - After finishing this module you will be able to take advantage of four different methods to determine the willingness to pay from customers. Whether using Market Data or Experiments (Observation based) or Expert or Customer Surveys (Survey based), you'll be able to use this information in order to identify the optimal price.\n\n3 - What we see in the real world is that companies don't only charge one price for all their products, but rather set different prices for different products with respect to different customer segments. After looking at the benefits of price discrimination (and the significant revenue and profit potential behind it), you will be able to figure out what type and how to implement price discrimination for your products and services.\n\n4 - In this final module we will look at pricing psychology. You will then be able to \"manipulate\" customers so they perceive a higher value in the products and services that you deliver, or so that they feel less pain by paying the price of purchasing your products. You will have in your toolkit multiple ways to maximize your sales, revenues, and profitability. We will also conduct a couple of experiments with volunteer customers to see how price affects perceptions, and how you can profit from it.",

    "description": "Prominent business school researchers have identified a powerful model for making business decisions that is based on economics, law and ethics.  The Three Pillar model in this course expands this model by adding strategy in place of economics.  With this change, the model becomes a practical framework that you can use to make all types of decisions—business, leadership and personal.\n\nThis course uses business decision making to show you how to use the model.  In essence, to achieve business and career success, you must manage risk (the Law Pillar) and create value (the Strategy Pillar) in a responsible manner (the Ethics Pillar).\n\nBecause the Law Pillar is especially important and challenging, the course provides legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements of business success, such as (1) attracting the best employees, (2) developing successful products, (3) creating new business models, (4) protecting intellectual property, (5) creating contracts that achieve business goals, and (6) using dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nIn taking a global perspective in covering these elements, the course provides an introduction to the global business culture to learners from the United States, and an introduction to the US business culture to learners from outside the US. \n\nWith this background on the Law Pillar, after completing this course you should be able to:\n\n- Manage the key risks you face in business.\n- Create value for your business by linking the Law Pillar to the Strategy Pillar.\n- Use the Ethics Pillar to become a leader in creating or managing a business that serves the interests of society while creating profits for its shareholders.\n\nAfter you master the Three Pillar model for business decisions, you can easily apply the model to your personal decisions and to leadership decisions in non-business settings.\n\nHow to successfully complete this course (4 steps):\n\n(1) Watch the short videos for each module.  The videos are interactive and include questions to test your understanding of the Three Pillars model.  You can watch them week-by-week or you can binge watch them.  Someone who binge-watched my first MOOC (“Successful Negotiation:  Essential Strategies and Skills”) concluded “It’s as good as ‘Breaking Bad.’”\n\n(2) Do the readings.  The readings are short and designed to help you use the Three Pillar model in making everyday business decisions.  They reinforce the videos and add additional coverage. \n\n(3) “Show what you know” by taking the practice quizzes at the end of each module.\n\n(4) Take the final examination.  The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.   \n\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate through the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course.  A Certificate provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Michigan logo.  If you're considering getting a Course Certificate, you should complete the verification process before taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or after the exam.",

    "description": "Carsonella ruddii is a bacterium that lives symbiotically inside some insects. Its sheltered life has allowed it to reduce its genome to only about 160,000 base pairs. With only about 200 genes, it lacks some genes necessary for survival, but these genes are supplied by its insect host. In fact, Carsonella has such a small genome that biologists have conjectured that it is losing its “bacterial” identity and turning into an organelle, which is part of the host’s genome. This transition from bacterium to organelle has happened many times during evolutionary history; in fact, the mitochondrion responsible for energy production in human cells was once a free-roaming bacterium that we assimilated in the distant past. Given a collection of simulated error-free read-pairs, use the paired de Bruijn graph to reconstruct the Carsonella ruddii genome. Compare this assembly to the assembly obtained from the classic de Bruijn graph (i.e., when all we know is the reads themselves and do not know the distance between paired reads) in order to better appreciate the benefits of read-pairs. For each k, what is the minimum value of d needed to enable reconstruction of the entire Carsonella ruddii genome from its (k, d)-mer composition?",

Il faut aussi renverser votre rapport à l’échec, qui est une source d’expérience et doit être géré selon la logique de la « perte acceptable » : l’entrepreneur aime l’incertitude, pas le risque démesuré. La création d’entreprises technologiques vous offre une réelle occasion de contribuer à changer le monde mais nécessite que vous adoptiez un certain état d’esprit et que vous puissiez acquérir des savoirs, des savoir-faire et des savoir être, ainsi qu’une expérience la plus large possible.\n\nVous aurez l'occasion de côtoyer des personnes passionnantes et passionnées issues d'horizons très différents. A partir d’une vision et d’une technologie de pointe, ces femmes et ces hommes ont souvent bâti des entreprises d’envergure mondiale.\n\nLa trajectoire de développement d'une entreprise technologique est pleine d’imprévus qui vous demanderont à la fois de l’agilité et une préparation importante pour partir d’une idée forte, sélectionner votre marché, développer votre offre, réunir une équipe à la hauteur des enjeux et trouver des financements.\n\nCe cours se compose de sessions méthodologiques ainsi que de témoignages d'entrepreneurs et d’acteurs emblématiques de la création d'entreprises technologiques. Vous pourrez ainsi vous familiariser avec les dilemmes essentiels auxquels sont confrontés les créateurs d'une entreprise high tech, à commencer par la décision de créer sa propre structure, qui représente un véritable choix de vie. \n\nVous verrez également que la création d'une entreprise technologique est davantage une aventure collective qu’un parcours individuel.",

    "description": "According to Steven Blank a business startup, or any new venture startup is essentially a proto-type. Thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto-type into a scalable, replicable finished 'product'.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to:\n   -complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom, and how they will make \n    money.\n   - systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources, and\n   - use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended.\n\nThe days of the 40 page business plan have certainly passed, but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance. In this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation. Action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions.\n\nThe planning here is focused on learning. It is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they (and often no one else) has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face. Thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate, non-applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom, and how it will make money. The course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions, and obtaining specific, applicable data. It will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro-forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model.",

    "description": "This class covers the fundamental principles underlying cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) starting with the basic anatomy of electron microscopes, an introduction to Fourier transforms, and the principles of image formation. Building upon that foundation, the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.\n\nPre-requisites:\nThe recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.\n\nPace: \nThere are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual “modules” lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of “concept check” questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.\n\nIt is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.",

Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.\n\nWe will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. \n\nFor those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisher’s exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).",

    "description": "Managing a company in the food and beverage industry is a fascinating task.\n\nFood and beverage products are so deeply rooted in the culture of most countries that making and selling them is not only a matter of making and selling good and tasty products, but products that nurture people's body, soul, and heart. Given this, it's not difficult to see that the task quickly becomes complex.\n\nThe objective of this course is twofold: first, we will focus on contemporary challenges that managers and entrepreneurs in food and beverage businesses should be able to face; and second, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nThis course is made up of four modules and an introduction, each exploring one dilemma that food and beverage companies face. You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers. These lectures combine an accessible introduction to specific topics integrated with interviews of managers and experts that will give precious insights and examples to the participants.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience with us, we will make a Documentary on the Excellences of the Modena District available for you, which is in a format that we have developed specifically for this course in order to give you the chance to experience first-hand the territory as our on-campus students usually do.\n\nEach module is paired with an evaluated quiz and weekly discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the F&B world, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\n\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy.\n\nBelow the guest speakers of the course:\n\nMasterchef Italia Sky – Nils Hartmann, Head of Movie Channels at Sky Italia – www.masterchef.sky.it\nEataly - Paolo Bongiovanni, Marketing Director Italy – www.eataly.net\nBerlucchi – Paolo Ziliani, Owner – www.berlucchi.it\nJoia Restaurant – Alta Cucina Naturale – Pietro Leemann, Owner and Chef – www.joia.it\nBranca – Nicolò Branca, Owner – www.branca.it\nBarilla – Giuseppe Morici, President Region Europe – www.barilla.com\nProyecto Expo 2015 Chile – Guillermo Ariztia, Chile Pavillon Director – www.expomilan.cl\nWinery Il Cavallante, Milano – Sergio Morpurgo, Owner\nHeineken – Floris Cobelens, Marketing Director – www.heineken.com\nTRDN – Martin Oetting, Managing Director – www.trnd.com\nGROM – Federico Grom, Owner and Founder – www.grom.it/en\nTetra Pak – Matthew Hatton, Director Competitor Intelligence – www.tetrapak.com\nBioHombre – Matteo Panini, CEO – www.hombre.it\nAcetaia Maletti – Carmen & Claudio Maletti\nCantine Riunite & CIV – Vanni Lusetti, CEO; Francesca Benini, Sales & Marketing Manager; Elena Lottici, Export Manager; Mario Vandi, Brand Manager – www.riunite.it\nGlemGas – Marco Guerzoni, Program Product Manager – www.glemgas.com\nBibendum Catering – LaFranceschetta58 – Sabrina Lazzereschi & Marta Pulini, Owners and Founders – www.bibendumcatering.it , www.franceschetta58.it\n\nDISCLAIMER - Since most of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and the subtitles.",

This is not a “how–to-do-it” course on data collection, but instead reviews the literature on survey design decisions and data quality in order to sensitize learners to how alternative survey designs might impact the data obtained from those surveys.\n\nThe course reviews a range of survey data collection methods that are both interview-based (face-to-face and telephone) and self-administered (paper questionnaires that are mailed and those that are implemented online, i.e. as web surveys). Mixed mode designs are also covered as well as several hybrid modes for collecting sensitive information e.g., self-administering the sensitive questions in what is otherwise a face-to-face interview. The course also covers newer methods such as mobile web and SMS (text message) interviews, and examines alternative data sources such as social media. It concentrates on the impact these techniques have on the quality of survey data, including error from measurement, nonresponse, and coverage, and assesses the tradeoffs between these error sources when researchers choose a mode or survey design.",

We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners, and with Professors Peter Glendinning and Mark Sullivan too!  A unique feature of this Course is the individual review and responsive input you will receive directly from Peter or Mark, who will be viewing your pictures and making evaluations of all projects at the end of the Capstone.\n\nDuring the entire period of development, you and your fellow learners will be supporting each other as you work independently, by sharing your work-in-progress from the initial Project Plan to the final Portfolio.  At each stage, all Learners will share comments and suggestions with each other, helping each other to gauge progress and to learn about different approaches to photography and content.  By expressing your own ideas and expectations about quality in response to the work of others, you will be forming your own criteria of excellence as well.  \n\nAlong the way there will be multiple opportunities for sharing pictures and ideas through carefully designed Peer Review.  This sharing of photographs and comments with peers, and reflecting on their comments about your photos, will be an exciting learning experience that will help you grow in understanding your own photography and that of others.  Your contribution of comments to fellow Learners will not only help them understand their photographs better, but it will give you an opportunity to use the vocabulary of terms that are related to techniques, design principles, and content approaches that you have learned through your success in each of the previous Modules.  \n\nA unique aspect of this Specialization is that everyone who completes the requirements will receive, in addition to their Certificate of Specialization from Michigan State University, access to substantial discounts on equipment, accessories, and membership benefits through Industry Partners from among the premier manufacturers of photography equipment:  LensPen, Lume Cube lighting, Photo District News,  Schneider Optics, Think Tank Cases/Bags, LensBaby, and Fractureme, along with a 1-year membership in PhotoVideoEdu.com providing special student discounts from major photo-equipment manufacturers.

For example, how does gender inequality play itself out in a changing Indian society, how do the modernist conceptions of art entailing market valuation challenge the more socio-centric values found in South India, what are the politics linguistic identities, and how might India address its myriad development challenges such as poverty and unemployment.\n\nNo specific prior knowledge is required. However, it would be helpful if students are aware of the socio political dynamics at play in contemporary India and keep themselves abreast with current affairs and debates in the country to fully appreciate the various dimensions and contours if the subject matter in the course.\n\nThis course is taught in English.",

The course includes high-quality video lectures, interviews with experts, demonstrations of how to build economic models in spreadsheets, practice quizzes, and a range of recommended readings and optional readings. Assessment is by a final exam. \n\nThe key economic principles that we’ll learn about can help us understand changes that have occurred in agriculture, and support improved decision making about things like agricultural production methods, agricultural input levels, resource conservation, and the balance between agricultural production and its environmental impacts. \n\nThere are literally thousands of agricultural economists around the world who work on these issues, so there is a wealth of knowledge to draw on for the course.",

    "description": "-- About the Course --\n\nFrom the Nuremberg trial to the case against Saddam Hussein, from the prosecution of Al-Qaeda terrorists to the trial of Somali pirates – no area of law is as important to world peace and security as international criminal law.  Taught by one of the world’s leading experts in the field, this course will educate students about the fundamentals of international criminal law and policy.  We will explore the contours of international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, terrorism, and piracy.  We will examine unique modes of international criminal liability and specialized defenses.  And we will delve into the challenges of obtaining custody of the accused and maintaining control of the courtroom.\n\n-- Course Syllabus --\n\nThis course comprises eight units (or \"modules\"). Each will include an assigned reading, typically an article or book chapter, as well as a simulation designed to bring the readings to life.\n\nI will also offer video lectures on each of the topics, accompanied by slides.  In addition, there will be online role-play exercises and debates, enabling the students to share their own insights. \n\nThe order of class sessions will be:\n\n(1)     History: From Nuremberg to The Hague\n\n(2)     International Crimes Part 1: War Crimes, Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, and Torture\n\n(3)     International Crimes Part 2: Terrorism and Piracy\n\n(4)     Special modes of liability: command responsibility, co-perpetration, and incitement\n\n(5)      Special defenses: insanity, obedience to orders, duress, and head of state immunity\n\n(6)      Gaining custody of the accused: extradition, luring, abduction, and targeted killing\n\n(7)      Pre-Trial Issues: plea bargaining, self-representation, and exclusion of torture evidence\n\n(8)      Maintaining control of the courtroom    \n\n-- Recommended Background --\n\nYou don’t have to be a lawyer and there are no prerequisites for this course. However, the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading and writing comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. \n\n-- Suggested Readings --\n\nStudents should read the assigned online materials for each unit in advance of the class session.  \n\nIn addition, students are invited to subscribe to “War Crimes Prosecution Watch,” a free bi-weekly e-newsletter that summarizes the latest developments in the field of international criminal law.\n\n-- Course Format --\n\nThis course is made up of eight content units. Each unit is based on an online reading assignment, a video lecture of about one hour in length, and one or more role play exercises to stimulate on-line discussion. The course also offers in-video enrichment quizzes (ungraded) for each unit, a ten question multiple choice midterm diagnostics exam (ungraded), and a ten question True/False Final Exam.   \n\n-- FAQ--\n\nHow will this course be graded? \n\nThis course is graded on completion. In order to complete the course each student must: (1) finish each module (or “lesson”); (2) write at least one essay response of 200 words or more for at least one simulation throughout the course; and (3) get a score of 6 out of 10 or better on the Final Exam.\n\nWhat resources will I need for this course?\n\nFor this course, all you need is an Internet connection, and the time to read and discuss the exciting materials available online.\n\nWhat is the coolest thing about this course?\n\nThe topics we will be discussing are ripped from the headlines.  The topics are often controversial and thought-provoking, and always exciting.",

While the course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that in other parts of the world, the nature of the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors may not be the same. Nevertheless,it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/SXZEZS.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 2 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions to be explored this week are: What is the board's role in planning for the organization's future and why is it important for nonprofit organizations to do it? What is strategic planning and what can boards do to carry this out effectively? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions: What is the board's role in assessing the performance of the organization? Why is performance assessment important? Why do many boards have difficulty meeting their performance assessment responsibilities? \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What are the elements of the fundraising/resource development process? What is the board's role in ensuring the organization has adequate funding? What information should be in a resource development plan? \n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

Clinical research provides us with this evidence, guiding health professionals towards solutions to problems that they face in daily practice. Transferring existing problems in medical practice to a research setting is a challenging process that requires careful consideration.

Medical researchers will lean how to translate real clinical problems into tangible research questions for investigation, gaining insight into some of the most important considerations when designing an epidemiological study along the way. \n\nCore concepts will be introduced along four key themes: diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and etiology.

While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.\n\nThere is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles' development as musicians and songwriters.",

    "description": "All goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level. Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n•\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n•\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n•\tExplain elasticity of demand.\n•\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Do you want to be able to converse with specialists about anything from regression and classification to deep learning and recommender systems?\n\nIn this course, you will get hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  At the end of the first course you will have studied how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.  Through hands-on practice with these use cases, you will be able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.\n\nThis first course treats the machine learning method as a black box.  Using this abstraction, you will focus on understanding tasks of interest, matching these tasks to machine learning tools, and assessing the quality of the output. In subsequent courses, you will delve into the components of this black box by examining models and algorithms.  Together, these pieces form the machine learning pipeline, which you will use in developing intelligent applications.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  \n   -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.\n   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  \n   -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.\n   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. \n   -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.\n   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.\n   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  \n   -Implement these techniques in Python.",

    "description": "Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural progression, the online course has been separated into 3 units, this is Unit 2.",

    "description": "Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high. \n \nSince then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.\n\nAfter we’ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we’ll be talking about vaccination too. We’ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus. \n\nWe're looking forward to having you join us for an exciting course!",

    "description": "Recommender systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.\n\nThe algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.\n\nIn addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, you will be able to earn a Verified Certificate by verifying your identity via a webcam and a government-issued ID. This option will provide formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Minnesota logo. Before then, you can complete a “test run” of the exam. You can then re-take the exam after the Verified Certificate becomes available.

    "description": "¿Le interesa el idioma español y se preocupa por la corrección, el estilo y las variaciones de la lengua española? \n\n¿Siente curiosidad acerca de las variaciones española y argentina o americana del Español estudiadas en textos cultos de referencia? En este curso se estudian empíricamente algunos aspectos relevantes de esas variedades de la lengua con datos significativos de las versiones hispanas de J. D. Salinger: «El cazador oculto», argentinas; y «El guardián entre el centeno», españolas.\nLas Encuestas de Evaluación de la edición anterior (http://bit.ly/1QYPAJI) permiten hacerse una idea cabal de las consideraciones que ha merecido el curso.\n\nEn este curso, con una consideración policéntrica de la lengua, se pretende activar o potenciar el interés por la corrección de los textos propios y ajenos; por las diferencias de estilo en dos versiones de G. V. Higgins; y por las variedades peninsular y argentina o americana de la lengua española en las diferentes versiones de J.D. Salinger.\n\nLa finalidad del curso es doble. \nAnte un texto ajeno suscitar el interés sobre lo que se dice; y sobre cómo se diría mejor: con más claridad, con más precisión, con más propiedad, con un ‘estilo’ de mayor calidad argumentada lingüísticamente. \nY, ante un texto propio, suscitar la preocupación sobre cómo decir mejor lo que se pretende: con más claridad, de manera unívoca; con más precisión; con gusto más general y sancionado; con ‘estilo’ de mejor consideración. \n\nFinalizar este curso le permitirá: \n1. Primero, identificar, advertir y argumentar las posibles inconvenientes (sin prestigio) de expresión en textos de autores españoles. \n2. Segundo, estudiar y evaluar las alternativas y variaciones (¿de estilo?) entre dos versiones españolas actuales de «Los amigos de Eddie Coyle», de G. V. Higgins (1973 [El Chivato] frete a la versión de 2011), \n3. Tercero, estudiar y evaluar empíricamente algunos aspectos significativos de las alternativas y variaciones del español en España y en Argentina con datos de las cuatro versiones en español de J. D. Salinger («El guardián entre el centeno», versiones españolas de 1978 y de 2007; y «El cazador oculto», versiones argentinas de 1961 y de 1998). \n\nEstos dos últimos objetivos tiene más valor por dos motivos: \n•\tLos textos de observación cumplen, sin duda, una condición esencial en el análisis y evaluación empírica lingüística: la condición de la ‘paráfrasis’: real (con diferencias de estilo, en los textos de Higgins) o alternativa (con variaciones de lengua, argentina y americana, o bien peninsular, en las versiones de Salinger), que dicen, o pretenden decir lo dicho en el texto fuente.\n•\tLas versiones de ‘El guardián…’ / ‘El cazador…’, desde distintos asuntos permiten referirse a las variaciones de lengua según los diferentes momentos de la versión o según la variedad territorial de lengua. \n\nNo es un curso sobre datos. Es un curso que, con algunos datos, opera sobre la competencia en advertir inconvenientes o aciertos expresivos y sobre la valoración y argumentación de diferentes alternativas de expresión y de algunas manifestaciones de la variedad argentina y española de lengua.",

You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.   In addition, as your programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.\n\nThe backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.

After completing this course, you will have a greater mastery of algorithms than almost anyone without a graduate degree in the subject.\n\nSpecific topics in Part 2 include: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes), dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees, shortest paths), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, analysis of heuristics, local search.\n\nAbout the instructor: Tim Roughgarden has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University since 2004.  He has taught and published extensively on the subject of algorithms and their applications.",

In fact, due to the extraordinary growth of the cloud, it has been described as a tornado, not a fluffy white floating object!\n\nCommercial research analysts consider cloud as one of the most significant trends with a potential to change the whole global IT industry.  Governments, including those in the US, Britain, and Australia, have cloud-first policies now in place which mandate cloud over non-cloud services in ICT procurement.  But CIOs and other senior executives, while it's on the majority of their agendas, aren't sure what it really means for their organisations - how to leverage the benefits, control the commercials, manage the business risk, and adapt their organisations.  \n\nWhile it is important to set requirements, negotiate commercials and sign the contract it is also critical that we develop a clear plan for ‘Moving to the Cloud’ which realigns our business architecture, organization and most importantly our people.\nThis course provides the answers that senior management must know to be successful and realise the benefits:\n\n•\tWhere should I go cloud? \n•\tWhat are the commercials?\n•\tWhere is my leverage?\n•\tHow do I realign my business practices and architecture?\n•\tHow do I gear up my people and structure my organisation?",

    "description": "What is philosophy?  How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.",

The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.\n\nIn addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments. To this end, we discuss a variety of concrete problems, including debates about economic inequality, affirmative action and the distribution of health care, the limits of state power in the regulation of speech and religion, and difficulties raised by the emerging threat of global environmental decay.",

For example, it may be suited to experienced statisticians, analysts, engineers who want to move more into a business role, in particular in marketing.\n\nYou will find this course exciting and rewarding if you already have a background in statistics, can use R or another programming language and are familiar with databases and data analysis techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.\nHowever, it contains a number of recitals and R Studio tutorials which will consolidate your competences, enable you to play more freely with data and explore new features and statistical functions in R.\n\nBusiness Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics today, and for good reasons. Companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.\n\nIt's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.\n\nBut at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers, (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on, and (3) what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.\n\nThat's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what you'll learn to do in this course.",

By learning how Europe works, a new world will open up to you and \ndiscover new jobs you never heard of.\n\nThe European Union has a large, yet often unnoticed, impact on many aspects of everybody’s life. We will analyze what the EU is doing for YOU regardless of where you live. We will also look at what YOU can do for and in Europe.\n\nWhether you are traveling, eating, working, doing business, shopping, surfing the Internet or breathing, all these activities are largely shaped by the EU.  As a result no global citizen, business leader, lawmaker, lobbyist or student can effectively operate in Europe or in the world without a solid understanding of this unique laboratory of integration. \n\nWhile the EU is often depicted as a monstrous bureaucratic creature, condemned to irrelevance by the emerging economies, in 50 years it accomplished what other countries took centuries to realize. The EU remains the most accomplished experiment of economic, social and political integration in human history.\n\nGiven its inherent complexities, this Course aims at empowering you on what Europe can offer and will enable you to discover jobs and opportunities you were not aware of. Indeed, throughout the whole course, participants will be confronted with real-life examples of EU action. EU affairs professionals will share their personal EU experiences and tell us about their EU jobs. You will also be able to interact with the instructor and other participants, share your opinions, question the instructor’s assumptions and hence shape the course’s content.",

    "description": "This course 'Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course, the participants are able to:\n\n- Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy)\n- Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades\n- Assess ethical risks in their own organizational context\n- Design interventions to reduce such risks for themselves and their organization\n\nRecommended Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions—some more ethically, some less ethically—aren’t we?",

This course covers the music of Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Phil Spector, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed. \n\nRock emerged in the mid 1950s as a blending of mainstream pop, rhythm and blues, and country and western--styles that previously had remained relatively separate. This new style became the music of the emerging youth culture and was often associated with teen rebellion. We will follow the story of how this rowdy first wave of rock and roll (1955-59) was tamed in the early 60s but came roaring back with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and then went psychedelic by the end of the decade.",

    "description": "COURSE DESCRIPTION\nThis course provides an introduction to the most powerful engineering principles you will ever learn - Thermodynamics: the science of transferring energy from one place or form to another place or form. We will introduce the tools you need to analyze energy systems from solar panels, to engines, to insulated coffee mugs. More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass and energy conservation principles; first law analysis of control mass and control volume systems; properties and behavior of pure substances; and applications to thermodynamic systems operating at steady state conditions.\n\nCOURSE FORMAT\nThe class consists of lecture videos, which average 8 to 12 minutes in length. The videos include integrated In-Video Quiz questions. There are also quizzes at the end of each section, which include problems to practice your analytical skills that are not part of video lectures. There are no exams.\n\nGRADING POLICY\nEach question is worth 1 point. A correct answer is worth +1 point. An incorrect answer is worth 0 points. There is no partial credit. You can attempt each quiz up to three times every 8 hours, with an unlimited number of total attempts. The number of questions that need to be answered correctly to pass are displayed at the beginning of each quiz. Following the Mastery Learning model, students must pass all 8 practice quizzes with a score of 80% or higher in order to complete the course.\n\nESTIMATED WORKLOAD\nIf you follow the suggested deadlines, lectures and quizzes will each take approximately ~3 hours per week each, for a total of ~6 hours per week. \n\nTARGET AUDIENCE\nBasic undergraduate engineering or science student.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n- What are the prerequisites for taking this course? \n     An introductory background (high school or first year college level) in chemistry, physics, and calculus will help you be successful in this class.\n-What will this class prepare me for in the academic world? \n     Thermodynamics is a prerequisite for many follow-on courses, like heat transfer, internal combustion engines, propulsion, and gas dynamics, to name a few.\n-What will this class prepare me for in the real world? \n     Energy is one of the top challenges we face as a global society. Energy demands are deeply tied to the other major challenges of clean water, health, food resources, and poverty. Understanding how energy systems work is key to understanding how to meet all these needs around the world. Because energy demands are only increasing, this course also provides the foundation for many rewarding professional careers.",

    "description": "In this course you will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications. You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. You’ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world.\n\nSeveral parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using infinite data structures or functional reactive programming.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n - recognize and apply design principles of functional programs,\n - design functional libraries and their APIs,\n - competently combine functions and state in one program,\n - understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine \n   functions and state,\n - write simple functional reactive applications.\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

Students will work incrementally on a hands-on project that systematically adds pattern-oriented enhancements to the app they developed in MOOC #3, along with the appropriate automated unit tests, i.e., each week they will add new functional and unit testing capabilities to their app project, based on the material covered in the lecture videos. These lessons will demonstrate the benefits of good software engineering practices that are targeted at creating maintainable code for mobile apps.\n\nThere will be roughly 3-4 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments. The ordering of the modules within the course is designed to be flexible.

    "description": "The goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. It’s to hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that’s involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do a job and they’ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work and they’ll work for their passion.\n\nAnd this is not a case of “fake it until you make it.” You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the company, and the position – and be able to show how your goals in life align with the company’s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you demonstrate that you’re the right candidate for the job.\n\nThis course is the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1, #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing - can be taken in any sequence, while course #5 is the capstone for the specialization as a whole.\n\nThis course can be thought of as \"Interviewing I\", while course #3 is \"Interviewing II.\"  Course #3 covers more advanced interview formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process, involve all the skills that you'll learn from course #1 through course #3.\n\nAs for this course, it will teach you how to:\n\n1.\tDo thorough research on a company of your choice.\n\n2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).\n\n3.     Prepare for the all important \"Tell Me About Yourself\" question.\n\n4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.\n\n5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.\n\n6.\tPrepare an elevator speech - all three variations.\n\n7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.\n\n8.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.\n\n9.\tAdapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers.",

    "description": "This six-week long Capstone course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Specialization, including Pattern Discovery, Clustering, Text Retrieval, Text Mining, and Visualization, to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges. Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you’ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Capstone emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. \n\nThe goal of the Capstone project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: \n\n1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.\n2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.\n3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.\n4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.\n\nFrom the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. \n\nBy working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Capstone. \n\nYou are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will be peer-graded, and the top 20 reports, as evaluated by peer review, will also be judged by an Industry Expert Committee who will select 10 of the reports as the Best Capstone Projects. The Industry Expert Committee is composed of multiple relevant industry experts representing different companies.",

Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.  \n\nLearners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments.",

    "description": "Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.\n\nSince 2009 there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently.\nThis course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThree common themes will characterise the course: \n\nWe privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional. \n\nWe seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood. \n\nWe seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity. \n\nUltimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.",

    "description": "Magical thought has always attracted human imagination. In this course we will introduce you to the Middle Ages through a wide conception of magic. Students will have an approach to medieval culture, beliefs and practices from the perspective of History and History of Science. Popular magic, as well as learned magic (alchemy, geomancy and necromancy) will be addressed. Moreover, we will also deal with how eastern practices and texts influenced western culture. In July 2016, the course will contain a brand-new module devoted to astrology. Magic in the Middle Ages offers a captivating overview of medieval society and promotes reflection about certain stereotypes associated with this period.\n\nAt the end of the course, the students:\n\na) will have overcome the usual prejudices about the Middle Ages, \nb) will be able to analyze historical documentation from the Middle Ages and recognize the most common patterns of juridical documents regarding witchcraft, and \nc) will be capable of distinguishing between popular magic and the magic of the learned people; will have a notion of which spiritual practices were allowed in medieval Europe and which ones were related to the devil, and will be aware of the link between a cultural product and the society that produced it.\n\nThis course is taught in English, although subtitles in English, Catalan and Spanish will also be provided.\n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\n\nWeek 1.

You can get feedback on your performance and compare what you did to how others approached the same scenario. The cases also provide a setting to discuss a wide-ranging set of topics including preparing for a negotiation, making ultimatums, avoiding regret, expanding the pie, and dealing with someone who has a very different perspective on the world. Advanced topics include negotiating when you have no power, negotiating over email, and the role of gender differences in negotiation. To close out the course, we will hear insights from three negotiation experts: Linda Babcock, Herb Cohen, and John McCall MacBain. Enjoy.",

    "description": "This course deals directly with your ability for creativity which is a critical skill in any field. It focuses on divergent thinking, the ability to develop multiple ideas and concepts to solve problems. Through a series of creativity building exercises, short lectures, and readings, learners develop both an understanding of creativity and increase their own ability.\n\nThis course will help you understand the role of creativity and innovation in your own work and in other disciplines.  It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration.  This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. \n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice. At the same time, these exercises are constrained by concerns of safety, legality, and economics, which are addressed in their creative process.",

    "description": "Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen. International perspective on leadership, common traps & challenges, and opportunities of intercultural leadership. \nWeek 2 - Navigating Culture. Impact of cultural differences on organizations, decoding culture, culture classifications and stereotyping, developing intercultural intelligence. \nWeek 3 - Communication. Communication and its impact on leadership identity and relationships, managing communication to improve decision making, steps for developing your intercultural communication skills.\nWeek 4 - Motivation. Views on individual motivation, cultural differences in motivation, developing motivation and commitment in teams.\nWeek 5 - Networking. Patterns of interpersonal relationships in/across organizations, strategically developing social networks and social capital, norms for networking across cultures.\nWeek 6 - Conflict. Effective / defective conflict management approaches, dealing with ethical dilemmas.\nWeek 7 - Outro and Aknowledgements\n\nThanks to the participation of our alumni and of the Bocconi Alumni Association, participants will have practical insights on international leadership.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND\nAll are welcome! Some prior exposure to basic issues of organizational behavior (communication, decision making, motivation, etc.) is useful, but not required.",

Design sprints allow you to meet clients' desire for solutions--to develop sooner--and still adjust based on feedback. But not all sprints are alike. In this course, you’ll learn how to run situation-appropriate sprints, whether it's testing user motivation, interface usability, or solution fit, to avoid waste and deliver value. \n\nWe'll show you how to: \n- Plan and conduct a design sprint that delivers valuable, actionable insights\n- Effectively test motivation and value propositions\n- Effectively test user interface (even without working software)\n- Focus and drive to actionable conclusions on questions of approach and architecture\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

    "description": "As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain. \n\nFor the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it! \n\nIn this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.",

The original articles were these concepts appeared are however not frequently part of the normal curriculum of biologists, biochemists and medical students.\n\nThis course proposes to read study and discuss a small selection of these classical papers, and to put these landmarks in their historical context. Most of the authors displayed interesting personal histories and many of their contributions go beyond not only the papers we will read but probably all their scientific papers.\n\nOur understanding of the scientific process, of the philosophy underlying the process of scientific discovery, and on the integration of new concepts is not only important for the history of science but also for the mental development of creative science.",

Then it analyzes experience of market reforms in China, India, other Asian countries, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America at the same period. Finally, it discusses the problems of contemporary global economy and global and regional economic governance with the special focus given to emerging-market economies and their role.\nBy the end of the course you will be able to analyse emerging-market economies and economies in transition, taking into account their crucial characteristics and historical experience.\n\nParticipation in the course does not require any preconditions, however, basic economic knowledge would be an advantage.\n\nIn order to pass successfully this course you must score not less than 80% for each of six after module quizzes and complete the peer-assessed essay at the end of the course.",

You will hear from various professionals about their contexts and the different challenges and opportunities the process includes.\n\nThis course will cover topics such as facilitation process techniques, energy modeling, scenario building, innovation and policy making. You will have the opportunity to respond to these topics with ideas and reflection from your own context. Whether you are a climate change practitioner, work in development or are simply curious about how climate mitigation is understood, this course will give you insights into the complexity of how countries from the South pursue development goals while addressing climate mitigation.\n\nThe course is free to enroll and take.

    "description": "What you’ll achieve: \n\nIn this project-centered course*, you will design a series bible and write a complete pilot episode for your own unique television or web series, be it drama or comedy or something in between. You’ll learn to break down the creative process into components, and you’ll discover a structured process that allows you to produce a polished and pitch-ready script in just a few weeks. Completing this project will increase your confidence in your ideas and abilities, and you’ll feel prepared to pitch your first script and get started on your next. \n\nThis is a course designed to tap into your creativity and is based in \"Active Learning\". Most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing our scripts. This aspect was very important to me.\" Ingrid\n\nThe course curriculum is simple: you’ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with your peers. \n\nI am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won’t \"show\" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.\n\n“David's lecture style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When I watch the lectures I feel David’s sincere desire for me to create something truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing; not by watching him talk at us.” - A R Adamson\n\nWhat you’ll need to get started:\n\nTo begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.\n\nLearner Review: \"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David's guidance is spot on, he's his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough, and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! \"\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: This is a ‘project-centered course’, which means it is designed specifically to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share. \n\nTime: 1-2 hours of study,  30+ hours of active project work",

    "description": "The path for entrepreneurs to grow their companies outside of well-developed entrepreneurial ecosystems like Silicon Valley is challenging. Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they've hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland's attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we've learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different. Don’t expect to see me standing in front of the camera, talking and lecturing every module. Instead, the lectures will be relatively short in length and will have more of the feel of an engaging documentary than a static classroom setting.",

    "description": "In the course “Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communications\": we will:\n\n1)\tBuild skills in the analysis of the intercultural communication process using Russian-Western communication as an example. \n2)\tApply the knowledge of interrelations between different contexts of communication (cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal, etc.) to the cultural history and national psychology of Russians.\n\nThe purpose of the course is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing the past, the present and the future interactions between Russia and the West, with a focus on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western Europeans.\n\nFor example, we will look at the cases when basic cultural values of Russians show up through the linguistic choices shaping language production which is consequently misattributed by Western partners. No matter what the language of intercultural communication is – Russian, or English – the meaning of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives of another culture.\n\nSome of the basic questions we will tackle are:\n\n•\tWhat are the concepts of culture that have the strongest influence on communication?\n•\tWhat are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness?\n•\tWhat are the specific communication patterns of modern Russians, including those of public and electronic discourse?\n•\tWhat is important to know about communication with Russians in organizational contexts?\n\nImportantly, this course is NOT just a list of practical instructions of dos and don’ts of dealing with Russians. The course contains a substantial academic component introducing the key notions and concepts of the Theory of Communication, which will be extensively introduced throughout the first few modules of the course. These theoretical grounds will be further on used as a tool for analyzing the intercultural communications with Russians.",

    "description": "How to Reason Inductively\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nThink Again: How to Reason Inductively \nWant to solve a murder mystery? What caused your computer to fail? Who can you trust in your everyday life? In this course, you will learn what distinguishes inductive arguments from deductive arguments and then how to analyze and assess five common forms of inductive arguments: generalizations from samples, applications of generalizations, inference to the best explanation, arguments from analogy, and causal reasoning. The course closes by showing how probability can be used to help us make decisions of all sorts.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 8-12, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

    "description": "Most people know that electrically active cells in nerves, in the heart and in the brain generate electrical currents, and that somehow these result in measurements we all have heard about, such as the electrocardiogram.  But how?  That is, what is it that happens within the electrically active tissue that leads to the creation of currents and voltages in their surroundings that reflect the excitation sequences timing, and condition of the underlying tissue.  This course explores that topic.  Rather than being a primer on how to interpret waveforms of any kind in terms of normality or disease, the goal here is to provide insight into how the mechanism of origin actually works, and to do so with simple examples that are readily pictured with simple sketches and one’s imagination, and then moving forward into comparison with experiments and finding outcomes quantitatively.",

    "description": "Myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time. Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo Lectures: 2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity and Signs \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures: 5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans. (Chicago)\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 3, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore , trans. (Chicago)\n• Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, M. L. West, trans. (Oxford)\n• Homeric Hymns, Sarah Ruden, trans. (Hackett)\n• Homer, The Odyssey, Robert Fagles, trans. (Penguin) \n• Virgil, The Aeneid, Robert Fitzgerald, trans. (Vintage)\n• Ovid, Metamorphoses, David Raeburn, trans. (Penguin)\n\nThese translations are a pleasure to work with, whereas many of the translations freely available on the internet are not. If you do not want to purchase them, they should also be available at many libraries. Again, these texts are not required, but they are helpful.",

This course aims to address the gap between seeing and truly understanding photographs by introducing a diversity of ideas, approaches, and technologies that inform their making. In this course you will look closely at photographs from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art and hear a variety of perspectives on what a photograph is and the ways that photography has been used throughout its nearly 180 year history: as a means of artistic expression, as a tool for science and exploration; as an instrument of documentation; to tell stories and record histories; and as a mode of communication and critique in our ever increasingly visual culture.",

    "description": "Welcome to Quantitative Formal Modeling and Worst-Case Performance Analysis. In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   \n\nAfter finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.\n\nDisclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow. So this course is a good primer for any more advanced course on the topic.\n\nThis course is part of the university course on Quantitative Evaluation of Embedded Systems (QEES) as given in the Embedded Systems master curriculum of the EIT-Digital university, and of the Dutch 3TU consortium consisting of TU/e (Eindhoven), TUD (Delft) and UT (Twente). The course material is exactly the same as the first three weeks of QEES, but the examination of QEES is at a slightly higher level of difficulty, which cannot (yet) be obtained in an online course.",

    "description": "Have you ever viewed a news report depicting the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster? The damage to human life and property are both staggering and heartbreaking. All parts of the world face the possibility of floods, hurricanes, tornados, fires, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural phenomena. Are you prepared if disaster would strike you? This course will help you prepare!\n\nThe course is appropriate for any learner who is proactive about developing the core competencies of disaster readiness and survival planning. It is especially useful if you are seeking techniques that can ensure your personal protection, as well as the safety of your family, property, and belongings, during a natural disaster. In addition, it offers essential preparation for a variety of emergency situations and inconveniences, even if you do not live in major tornado, flood, hurricane, tsunami, or earthquake zone. For instance, could you and your loved ones manage without access to potable water, electricity, fuel, and banking facilities? If you are unsure of your ability to respond in any of these possible scenarios, this course is for you!\n\nThroughout the course, you will be introduced to the Disaster Cycle, specifically the Mitigation and Recovery phases, and will create an extensive personal preparedness plan for survival in the absence of common amenities, such as food and water, shelter, and communication. You will also acquire practical, easy-to-apply strategies for maintaining a healthy attitude during disaster which can allow you to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon inner and outer resources in dire circumstances. Although death may be an inevitable outcome of extreme circumstances, a balanced outlook can provide comfort for all parties involved. Finally, issues of how institutions and governments can aid in disaster are also discussed.\nIf you are interested in this topic you may be interested in other online programs at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing.

    "description": "While the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn’t just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  \n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.\n\nEpigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros.

    "description": "The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology? \n\nThis course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation “works”? Would such an understanding validate meditation—or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We’ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn’t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier, but better people?",

    "description": "L'objectif du cours est de permettre une compréhension distanciée du dopage. C’est pour atteindre cet objectif que le cours s’appuie sur une approche pluridisciplinaire qui constitue une opportunité d'observer comment diverses disciplines abordent un même objet, selon différents angles et de manière complémentaire. Il s'agit également de donner des repères permettant d'appréhender le dopage dans sa complexité.\n\nLe dopage dans le sport est une pratique complexe dont la définition et l'identification renvoient à la construction sociale et historique de normes. \n\nLe cours propose une clarification des processus qui ont conduit à l'usage et la prohibition des produits dopants. L'amélioration des performances ou les transformations des apparences sont deux aspects du dopage qui dérangent alors que pourtant les sociétés vantent les mérites de \"l'amélioration\" du corps et que les marchés du \"human enhancement\" prospèrent. Ces apparentes contradictions seront analysées en montrant que, au-delà des questions sanitaires, le dopage est au croisement de multiples enjeux sociaux, scientifiques ou encore juridiques.\n\nPour y faire face, les autorités sportives et étatiques ont contribué à la mise en place d’institutions en charge de l'identification du dopage, de politiques de prévention, de répression et de recherche. Les dispositifs biologiques de contrôle comme le passeport biologique, les dimensions juridiques qui fondent la lutte contre le dopage, les organisations de production de la performance, comme les dimensions sociologiques du dopage seront abordés par ce cours.\n\nOutre les enseignants de l’Université de Lausanne, les meilleurs spécialistes du dopage, d’un laboratoire antidopage (LAD), du TAS (Tribunal Arbitral du Sport), de l’UEFA (football) et de l’AMA (Agence Mondiale Antidopage) interviennent dans ce cours. \n\nTeaser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70ZQVQsWAdo \n\nObjectifs pédagogiques principaux :\n\nA la fin de ce cours les participants seront capables de:\n\n1.\tIdentifier la dimension « culturelle » du dopage, c’est-à-dire comme pratique qui a une histoire en lien avec la transformation de normes sociales\n\n2.\tPasser d’un mode de raisonnement binaire sur le dopage, pour ou contre, à la compréhension de la complexité d’un phénomène à la fois biologique, psychologique et sociologique\n\n3.\tReconnaître les institutions, les acteurs et les pratiques de lutte contre le dopage\n\n4.\tExpliquer comment le contexte social et organisationnel pèse sur les décisions des individus et comment il peut être réduit par des mesures de prévention. \n\n5.\tIdentifier comment fonctionne la lutte contre le dopage et les procédures de contrôle",

In this course we will explore the different models of blended learning and dive into key issues that impact students, teachers, and schools. Specifically, we will look at these issues through the lens of three high-performing schools that each use a different type of blended learning.  A few of the key topics will include:\n\n- The role of the student and how to support students in the transition from traditional to blended learning\n- Implications for teachers in their day-to-day work and overall role\n- Impact on the way schools are designed including staffing models, use of time, hardware/software selection, and the use of data\n- Implementation challenges, potential solutions, and the remaining open questions\n\nWe will live by the attributes of blended learning in this course, encouraging students to take quizzes at the beginning of the module to assess their understanding and skip material they already know. Overall, we will take a hand-on approach and the course will culminate in participants prototyping their own blended learning model.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how to best leverage technology in education and rethink the way we run schools, join this MOOC and encourage your colleagues to do the same.

    "description": "Join us as we explore India - the fastest growing economy in the world and one of the most diverse places on earth. \n\nIndia is an important player in the human story and is making a rapid return to centre stage. Learning about India has never been more relevant to our lives and possibly our careers.\n\nThis course, developed through a grant from the U.S. Department of State’s Passport to India initiative, is designed to introduce people of all backgrounds and ages to India and its potential as a destination for study, research, work and entrepreneurship. \n\nWhatever your interests, this course will help you develop a more informed perspective on the importance of India. The sheer diversity and scale of India are reasons enough for making India not just important but fascinating too.\n\nMany agree that two of the rising trends of the coming decades are the re-emergence of Asia and technological change. India is at the heart of both trends and shares much in common with the United States.\n\nAt the current pace of change, we may see:\n\n•\tWithin 10 years, India is likely to overtake China and have the world’s largest population\n•\tIn 20 years, New Delhi overtaking Tokyo as the world’s largest city\n•\tIn 30 years, India could overtake China and the US as the world’s largest economy\n\nBy the time a current college student is the same age as their parents are today – the world will have changed dramatically. India’s importance is growing by the day and could very well have far-reaching implications for your life and career.\n\nEach week of this interactive course explores one major theme related to India’s importance in an interdisciplinary way.\n\nThis course is brought to you by the U.S. Department of State’s Passport to India initiative and is developed through a partnership between The Ohio State University and IndoGenius.",

However, they can read short pieces of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces. We will further learn about brute force algorithms and apply them to sequencing mini-proteins called antibiotics. \n\nIn the first half of the course, we will see that biologists cannot read the 3 billion nucleotides of a human genome as you would read a book from beginning to end.  However, they can read shorter fragments of DNA. In this course, we will see how graph theory can be used to assemble genomes from these short pieces in what amounts to the largest jigsaw puzzle ever put together.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will discuss antibiotics, a topic of great relevance as antimicrobial-resistant bacteria like MRSA are on the rise.  You know antibiotics as drugs, but on the molecular level they are short mini-proteins that have been engineered by bacteria to kill their enemies.  Determining the sequence of amino acids making up one of these antibiotics is an important research problem, and one that is similar to that of sequencing a genome by assembling tiny fragments of DNA.  We will see how brute force algorithms that try every possible solution are able to identify naturally occurring antibiotics so that they can be synthesized in a lab.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to sequence the genome of a deadly Staphylococcus bacterium that has acquired antibiotics resistance.",

    "description": "Le cours présente un tour d’horizon introductif des interactions entre la mobilité et les dynamiques urbaines. Il propose des outils méthodologiques et opérationnels permettant d’appréhender et de réguler la mobilité.   \n\nCes vingt dernières années, la mobilité urbaine a beaucoup changé. Le nombre de déplacements de loisirs a augmenté tandis que la part des déplacements pour motif travail a diminué. Dans le même temps, de nouvelles formes de mobilités se sont développées, comme la multirésidentialité, la pendularité de longue distance, le tourisme urbain et l’excursionnisme. Ces changements ont été concommittants de transformations urbaines comme l’étalement urbain ou la fragmentation.\n\nDans ce contexte, la mobilité est un enjeu pour l’ingénierie des transports urbains et le développement territorial, en particulier urbain: sa régulation nécessite une appréhension nouvelle de la demande de transport.\n\nLe cours montre ainsi aux étudiants les interrelations entre la ville et la mobilité, l’espace urbain et les flux de déplacements, tout en leur offrant une vision renouvelée du transport et de son impact sur le territoire et les modes de vie.",

    "description": "Sustainability, Resilience and Efficiency are fundamental considerations for city managers in managing urban infrastructures. Today, more than 3.9 billion people, making up more than 54% of the global population, live in cities. Urbanization is expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to 6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.\n\nSustainable development in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient engines of growth in both developing and developed economies. \nThis course will provide you with the basic principles of urban infrastructure management that are fundamental for building prosperous cities that are sustainable, resilient and efficient. \n\nIn order to obtain a certificate for this course, the participants have to pass four graded quizzes and complete four mandatory assignments, plus a final exam. In addition to the graded assignments students have the option to write a 7-10 page peer-reviewed case study about management of energy OR transportation system in their city (on your own choice). \nThe best case studies will be also evaluated by our jury at IGLUS and the authors of the 3 best case studies will win a full tuition fee waiver scholarship to enroll in the IGLUS professional training program in Spring 2017. \n\nFind out more about the IGLUS project at www.iglus.org",

The goal is to design artifacts that allow the users to meet their needs in the most effective efficient and satisfying manner. The course introduces the novice to a cycle of discovery and evaluation and a set of techniques that meet the user's needs.\n\nThis course is geared toward the novice. It is for learners that have heard about \"user experience\" or \"user interface\" design but don't really know much about these disciplines.\n\nThe course mantra is that “Design is a systematic and data driven process.” Design is systematic because it is based on a set of techniques and also on a cycle of discovery.\n\nIn this course the learner is introduced to the four step user interface design cycle. Along the way learners are exposed to a set of techniques to gather information about a) what the user needs b)how to design and model interfaces based on these and then how to evaluate the design to ascertain that the user's goals are met. These techniques are tools that are used in a standardized manner and give us the data we use in our design.\n\nThis means that anyone (regardless of their current training) that is willing to learn these techniques and follow the proposed cycle can be a UX designer!",

We need to interact with people around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.\n\nIntroduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through communication. \n\nUpon completion of this course, students should:\n•\thave knowledge of the history and development of communication science; \n•\thave knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; \n•\thave knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. \n\nBeginning the week of February 16, 2015, you will be able to join Signature Track, a system that verifies your identity when you take an exam. This option will allow you to earn a Verified Certificate, which provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Amsterdam logo.

    "description": "This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements with an emphasis on the balance sheet. However, to understand accounting driven financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less about counting and more about measuring. “What is it that is being measured?” Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions. By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the remaining measurement question.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tDescribe the purpose of a balance sheet.\n•\tDefine the three components of a balance sheet.\n•\tRecognize and understand the meaning of several items typically presented on a balance sheet. \n•\tExplain the broader purpose of financial statements and the role of accounting in producing the financial statements.\n•\tRead and, to some extent, interpret real-world balance sheets.\n\nIf you enjoy this business course and are interested in an MBA, consider applying to the iMBA, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price offered by the University of Illinois.

    "description": "What is philosophy?  How does it differ from science, religion, and other modes of human discourse?  This course traces the origins of philosophy in the Western tradition in the thinkers of Ancient Greece.  We begin with the Presocratic natural philosophers who were active in Ionia in the 6th century BCE and are also credited with being the first scientists.  Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while Heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world.  Parmenides of Elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later Greek theorists (such as Anaxagoras and the atomist Democritus) attempted to answer that objection.  In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question—“How shall I live?”—and his pupil, Plato, and Plato’s pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.  After the death of Aristotle, in the Hellenistic period, Epicureans and Stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition.  We will study the major doctrines of all these thinkers.  Part I will cover Plato and his predecessors.  Part II will cover Aristotle and his successors.",

Para poder aplicar estas ecuaciones para resolver problemas, es necesario manipularlas  siguiendo ciertas reglas que nos da el álgebra.\n    Piensa en el álgebra como la gramática, que nos dice cómo traducir nuestras ideas al lenguaje, cómo formar frases y oraciones a partir de palabras, cómo conjugar verbos, a identificar las partes de una oración, las reglas de acentuación, etcétera.\n    En este curso aprenderás a construir expresiones algebraicas a partir de frases, lo que te permitirá resolver problemas en los que  conoces algunos datos numéricos y necesitas encontrar otros.\n    Podrás plantear y resolver ecuaciones de primer grado, ecuaciones simultáneas y ecuaciones de segundo grado.\n    Este curso te va a ser muy útil si actualmente estas llevando un curso de álgebra en la escuela y tienes problemas con él.

Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such as a digital stopwatch.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Pong\".  \n\nRecommended Background - A knowledge of high school mathematics is required. While the class is designed for students with no prior programming experience, some beginning programmers have viewed the class as being fast-paced. For students interested in some light preparation prior to the start of class, we recommend a self-paced Python learning site such as codecademy.com.",

An on-going set of challenges is found in the evolution of International Reporting Standards. \n\nThe second module focuses on some recent changes in Standards, identifying the drivers for changes, and examining evolution in controversial areas such as leasing and goodwill. \n\nThe third and final module, Corporate Governance, examines issues which are causing people to re-assess the nature, purpose and scope of corporate governance, and challenges to making governance function effectively. Key issues here are the move to include a broader range of stakeholders, the perennial challenge of agency theory issues, shareholder activism, changing Board structures, and challenges to internal control to better manage risk. \n\nThis MOOC will be right for you if you are interested in engaging with some of the challenges facing finance professionals, even if you are not one yourself. If you are thinking about returning to study this will provide a taster of academic endeavours through reading articles, critiquing ideas, and blending theory with reality",

    "description": "We make economics decisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to study. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our decisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to produce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us. \n\nThis course is an introduction to the microeconomic theory of markets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We will start with the concept of scarcity and how specialization according to comparative advantage helps us achieve more than we could alone. Next we model a marked using the tools of Supply and Demand and learn what well working markets accomplish and what their limit are. We end by exploring the impact of government intervention on perfect markets. Examples are taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all purchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and policy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be an educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and evaluate market outcomes.",

This course is packed full of practical sports science information that provide youth coaches and parents with the practical pediatric sports science insights to successfully retain young athletes and develop their sport potential while avoiding injury and overtraining. We begin by examining the multidimensional nature of coaching, the relevant sport motor performance abilities, the impact of growth and development on motor skills, the gene versus practice controversy, and briefly overview the body structures strengthened through training. Then we explore the athlete's energy supply, where this energy comes from, and how it matures along with the athlete.

Learners involved in our programs over the decades have repeatedly told us that going over the material several times helps them progressively delve into the meaning and application of the ideas and experiences. As a result, we have designed this capstone so that it would be the third iteration of working with the ideas and experiences about effective leadership and inspiring its development in others. The first iteration was during one of the other MOOCs in terms of the videos, readings, Forum chats and reflective exercises. The second iteration was doing one of the personal learning or action learning assignments in one of the MOOCs that involved talking to others and writing an essay about the experience. If you had not done the Action learning assignment, then one of the two projects for this MOOC would involve doing it. The third is reviewing and revising your analysis of the experience as the Capstone project to show evidence that you can Be a Leader and help another Develop as a Leader.",

    "description": "This course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice’s Connexions project. \n\nThe fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, \"Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition\".  Links to these two texts will be available in the Introduction module.",

    "description": "In the past, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) were programs used only by audio engineers with a highly specific knowledge base, on machines inaccessible to most people. But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.\n\nIn this course, you will explore some of Live’s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.\n\nNote: If you do not own Ableton Live 9, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days. If you use the trial version, do not download it until the course is scheduled to begin.",

    "description": "In this project-centered course*, you will create a content-rich infographic on a topic of your choice using Adobe Illustrator (which you can download for a free, 30-day trial). You might choose to create a visual representation of data from the world of sports, entertainment, politics, or science, to explain a business trend or environmental issue, or even to present a theme or development from your personal life. Your finished infographic will engage your target audience and convey information clearly through effective use of design elements such as typography, color, and structure.\n\nWhether you’re a graphic designer, a writer or the intern in the department, you’ll learn: \n• what an infographic is and what makes a good one\n• how to work within your limits\n• how to work with a team (if you have one) \n• why infographics are effective \n• techniques for spotting data in stories\n• six valuable steps for planning an effective infographic \n• how to use and make some of the building blocks of infographics: maps, charts and flow charts \n• ways data can be visualized to clarify it and give it meaning \n• how to effectively design a good infographic by effectively using elements like type, color and an underlying grid structure\n• some free or cheap, online tools for making various kinds of infographics\n\nAs you work on your project, you’ll learn more about why infographics are effective, what makes a good infographic, and how to plan and design an infographic for maximum impact. You’ll explore various approaches to data visualization, and you’ll practice creating visualizations like maps, charts, flow charts, and simple drawings in your free version of Adobe Illustrator. Please note that if you are new to learning graphics software, making these graphics could take much longer than estimated as you learn and grow.\n\nWhat you’ll need to get started:\nThis project-based course is aimed at anyone interested in understanding, designing, and using infographics - from students and hobbyists to professional graphic designers. \n\nWe’ll use Adobe Illustrator for some components of the project. If you don’t have access to the full version of Illustrator,you can download a free version at www.Adobe.com/Illustrator. If the free 30-day trial runs out, you can \"purchase\" it for a month for about $20.  \n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project centered courses are designed specifically to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of like-minded learners providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

    "description": "Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. Text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors, and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about people’s opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. \n\nThis course will cover search engine technologies, which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons. First, while the raw data may be large for any particular problem, it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant, and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection. Second, search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and the major techniques in text retrieval, which is the underlying science of search engines.",

Entre éstos, sobresale la existencia de conflictos latentes, inherentes a un clima laboral deteriorado por una administración centralizada de forma excesiva, en donde no se delega y se impide la participación de la gente. Prevalece la falta de cooperación entre las áreas y sus colaboradores entre sí, aunado a una falta de liderazgo, trabajo en equipo y comunicaciones defectuosas, y agregando la existencia de una situación tensa, por la presencia de una élite de profesionistas y especialistas en los altos niveles de la organización, que influyen en toda la empresa, imponiendo los intereses y la cultura de su especialidad en beneficio de su propio trabajo y de las áreas afines al mismo. Esta élite crea un clima laboral que los demás consideran déspota y hostil.\n\nDichos aspectos hacen imposible el futuro desarrollo de la empresa y emplear el talento de la gente.\n\n¿Qué hacer para aclarar esta situación?, ¿podrán conciliarse los intereses mediante acuerdos de cooperación?, ¿qué elementos subyacentes deberán ser considerados?, ¿quiénes pueden representar a las partes?, y lo más importante, ¿podremos encontrar una fórmula que perdure?

We will also investigate key components of environment and level design as well as strategies designers use to define gameplay or advance it. We’ll also look at navigation and the elements that make your world as real (or unreal) as you want it to be.

Il s’agira durant le cours, dans un premier temps, de documenter le contexte de mobilité dans les villes africaines. Celui-ci est marqué depuis les indépendances par des crises climatiques et économiques qui entrainent des mouvements de migration des campagnes vers les villes, l’entrée de l’informel dans l’économie urbaine et une réduction des ressources budgétaires des Etats qui impacte l'investissement dans les services sociaux de base y compris le transport. Dans un second temps, le cours va explorer la théorie de la mobilité comme stratégie d’accès à la ville. Pour ce faire il analysera les stratégies de mobilité dans les villes africaines aussi bien résidentielles que quotidiennes et selon les catégories socioéconomiques. La troisième partie du cours est axée sur les politiques de gestion de la mobilité urbaine. Il s’agira de mettre en rapport les éléments du contexte identifiés avec les stratégies de mobilité analysées pour apprécier l’efficience des politiques de gestion urbaine et ressortir les forces et faiblesses en vue de l’action.",

    "description": "Intended for both newcomers who are curious about video games and experienced gamers who want to reflect on their passion, this course will explore what happens to stories, paintings, and films when they become the basis of massively multiplayer online games.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy—the novels, films, and video game—are our central example of how “remediation” transforms familiar stories as they move across media. \n\nThe course is designed as a university-level English literature class—a multi-genre, multimedia tour of how literature, film, and games engage in the basic human activity of storytelling.  Our journey will enable us to learn something about narrative theory, introduce us to some key topics in media studies and cover some of the history and theory of video games.  It will also take us to some landmarks of romance literature, the neverending story that lies behind most fantasy games: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, a bit of Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene, and poems by Keats, Tennyson, Browning, and others.\n\nDrawing on centuries of romance narrative conventions, the twenty-first century gaming industry has become a creative and economic powerhouse.  It engages the talents of some of our brightest writers, artists, composers, computer engineers, game theorists, video producers, and marketing professionals, and in 2012, it generated an estimated $64 billion in revenue.  Anyone interested in today’s culture needs to be conversant with the ways this new medium is altering our understanding of stories.  Join me as we set out on an intellectual adventure, the quest to discover the cultural heritage of online games.",

    "description": "We are in constant relationship with many organizations. Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.\n\nDo you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? \n\nOrganizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etc… will benefit a lot from this course.\n\nFor the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners. He will be offering \"office hours\" sessions through google hangouts and answering learner questions from the forums. We hope this direct interaction will add to your learner experience!

How do you group similar documents together?  How do you discover new, emerging topics that the documents cover?   \n\nIn this third case study, finding similar documents, you will examine similarity-based algorithms for retrieval.  In this course, you will also examine structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  You will implement expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.\n   -Identify various similarity metrics for text data.\n   -Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.\n   -Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.\n   -Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.\n   -Cluster documents by topic using k-means.\n   -Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.\n   -Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.\n   -Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).\n   -Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\n   -Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.\n   -Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python.",

We evaluate the scientific rigour of studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods adopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.\n\nThis course will help you understand the remarkable behaviours of wild animals from an evolutionary perspective. \n\n[Image: Peacock spider.

A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!\n\n(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ \n\n(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material. \n\nCourse Certificate\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate.

For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management. \n\nUsing a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how we think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. \n\nTopics include: the function of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the managerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.",

    "description": "Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World explores the immense variety of meditation practices past and present. We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course. \n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.",

Lectures and forum discussions will investigate site-based projects in both urban and non-urban locales, and ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. Furthermore, together we will delineate definitions of site-specificity, and look across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.\n\nSpecific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography will be introduced here, but the primary focus is navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and production challenges (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design).

In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption.",

    "description": "Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\nThe first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\nThe second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\nThe third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.",

    "description": "Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven’s music itself. \n\nThis season's Curtis courses are sponsored by Linda Richardson in loving memory of her husband, Dr. Paul Richardson. \n\nThe Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation supports Curtis's lifelong learning initiatives.",

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.",

    "description": "In business, data and algorithms create economic value when they reduce uncertainty about financially important outcomes. This course teaches the concepts and mathematical methods behind the most powerful and universal metrics used by Data Scientists to evaluate the uncertainty-reduction – or information gain - predictive models provide. \n\nWe focus on the two most common types of predictive model - binary classification and linear regression - and you will learn metrics to quantify for yourself the exact reduction in uncertainty each can offer.  These metrics are applicable to any form of model that uses new information to improve predictions cast in the form of a known probability distribution – the standard way of representing forecasts in data science. \n\nIn addition, you will learn proper methodology to avoid common data-analytic pitfalls when forecasting – such as being “fooled by randomness” and over-fitting “noise” as if it were “signal.” \n\nUniquely among data-analytics offerings, this course empowers you to understand and apply quite advanced information theory methods – Bayesian Logical Data Analysis - in business practice, without needing any calculus or matrix algebra, or any knowledge of Matlab or R or software programming. \n\nYou will be able to answer all homework and quiz questions either by using basic algebra, or with the special custom Microsoft Excel Templates provided. Nor is any prior experience with Excel required; we will cover in detail at the beginning everything you need to know about using Excel to succeed in the course itself. If you already know Excel, you can skip that part. \n\nBe aware that this is not a broad general Excel skills course; it focuses on use of Excel to calculate information-related metrics, and to solve real business problems, such as developing your own predictive analytics model for which credit card applicants a bank should accept and which reject as too risky. Real problems are complicated! \n\nPersonally I think learning to solve real problems is also a great way to learn Excel. We use specific tools in the Excel toolbox to build something useful, and you can always go back and learn more tools in the toolbox – more Excel functions – if and when you ever need them. \n\nThis course requires some mathematical background: you should already know how to solve for an unknown using algebra; and have a basic familiarity with sigma (summation) notation; the concept of logarithms and working with bases other than base 10 (including base 2, and the natural logarithm and base “e”); and probability theory concepts such as calculating conditional, product, and joint probabilities. These concepts are assumed in the course rather than taught.

Samples can be more carefully selected based on a researcher’s judgment, but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors.  Samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways, using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control.  It is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed in this course.

    "description": "VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL\n\nProbablemente, todos hemos jugado a algún videojuego, pero ¿qué hay detrás de él? Podemos decir que - con independencia del videojuego - hay un árduo trabajo multidisciplinar que incluye desde aspectos de diseño hasta la programación como tal del videojuego. Este curso pretende ser un curso introductorio que muestre qué aspectos hay que considerar en el videojuego, y que permita con posterioridad abordar individualmente los temas que se consideran nucleares: diseño, arte, motor del videojuego y 'game play'. \n\nAl completar este curso introductorio, podrás identificar, nombrar y explicar la importancia de los diferentes aspectos que hay que considerar al diseñar un videojuego. Pretendemos también que puedas evaluar qué partes del videojuego te interesan más, de cara a que puedas seguir un curso específico sobre esa temática, o bien, si deseas el conocimiento global, puedas abordar todo el programa especializado. Estarás listo para abordar más en profundidad estos temas nucleares (diseño, arte, motor del videojuego y 'gameplay') que se cubren de forma individualizada y en detalle en el resto de cursos del programa especializado.\n\n\nIMPORTANTE\nPuedes seguir el curso también en Inglés (subtítulos y cuestionarios).\n\n__________________\n\nENGLISH VERSION\n\nWe have all probably played a video game at least once in our life, but... what's behind them? We can say that -no matter what game it is- there's a difficult multidisciplinary work that involves factors that go from the design to the video game's programming. This is an introductory course that will show you which aspects we must consider in the video game, and it will subsequently help you to individually study the different videogames creation's nucleus: design, art, video game engine and gameplay.\n\nWhen you finish this introductory course, you will be able to identify, tell and explain the importance of the many aspects we must consider when designing a video game. We also want you to be able to avaluate which parts of a video game you're most interested in, so that you can later take the specific course on this topic -if you seek global knowledge you can see all the specialised program. Then you'll be ready to study more deeply these main topics -design, art, video game engine and gameplay- which are individually studied with detail during the other courses of the specialized program.\n\nIMPORTANT\nYou are able to follow this course in English (subtitles and quizzes).",

Con espíritu de descubridores nuestra curiosidad nos motiva a buscar respuestas, a explorar nuestro entorno, a entrar a lo desconocido y hallar nuevo conocimiento.\n\nRecibimos como verdaderos tesoros las contribuciones de quienes nos antecedieron en la aventura que es la ciencia, la física en particular. Asociamos estos tesoros a los científicos que los hallaron. Conociendo a los descubridores, los conocimientos de la física se tornan más humanos. Nos ubicamos en lo que era el pensamiento de sus contemporáneos para contrastar y reconocer lo extraordinario de sus logros innovadores, cómo impactaron en su momento, y luego tomando distancia, valoramos qué efecto han tenido como resultados notables, que trascienden su época y perduran hasta nosotros y tal vez hasta tiempos lejanos en el futuro.\n\nCon este curso para amantes de la ciencia, sin requisitos previos, adquieres una mejor imagen y perspectiva del universo, de su orden, del cosmos, formas de pensar, principios fundamentales para comprender mejor lo que existe, incluso para maravillarnos con nuestra propia existencia. \n\nObjetivos de aprendizaje:\n•\tReconocer y nombrar cuáles han sido los más destacados descubrimientos en la comprensión del universo físico desde la revolución científica de los siglos XVI y XVII hasta el final del siglo XIX, y cómo se llegó a encontrar este conocimiento.\n•\tAsociar los conocimientos de la física a los científicos quienes hicieron los descubrimientos, a la época y al pensamiento establecido en el entorno en que vivieron estos personajes.\n•\tIdentificar el impacto de los descubrimientos en la época de los científicos protagonistas, cuando hicieron sus contribuciones; y pensar críticamente sobre la trascendencia de este impacto hasta nuestros días.\n•\tFormar y construir una imagen informada de lo maravilloso que es el universo físico, el cosmos del cual somos parte.\n•\tDescubrir nuevas formas de pensar sobre el mundo a nuestro alrededor, reconociendo la belleza intrínseca de las leyes y principios físicos, que hacen posible nuestra existencia. \n•\tEncontrar la motivación para continuar enriqueciendo nuestro conocimiento sobre el universo físico, sobre la labor activa de los científicos en su investigación y sobre su impacto en nuestra vida cotidiana.\n\nPrerrequisitos:\nNo hay requisitos previos especiales para este curso, aunque es de utilidad tener una formación escolar básica. Sólo necesitas una actitud positiva y disposición para adquirir nuevo conocimiento enriquecedor en la cultura, no por la utilidad inmediata de adquirir una nueva destreza práctica, sino… ¡simplemente por el gusto y el placer de conocer mejor el universo y las leyes físicas fundamentales, por las cuales es posible que nosotros los humanos existamos!\n\nMaterial suplementario:\nTodos los videos y textos que encontrarás han sido desarrollados por el profesor, especialmente para este curso. Los materiales complementarios utilizados son de dominio público que puedes consultar a través del Internet, como por ejemplo páginas web “abiertas” donde encontrarás resultados científicos de la NASA, del CERN, etc.",

The course is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes. The course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems.\n\nThis course focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.  These techniques are based on biological mechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes. The approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories: 1) ordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential equation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.",

    "description": "Many find themselves frustrated in their careers by lack of preparation for dealing with predictable dilemmas that regularly arise in the world of work. Two in five professionals fired in their jobs after college are terminated for lying, or misuse of technology. Easy to avoid! Or is it? What if you find you have to compromise your values to keep your job? What if they ask you to lie or cheat, even though you know if you are found out you will be fired? What if you find out the company is breaking the law?\n\nSuccessful people know about and have the skills taught in this specialization. You should, too.\n\nThose who wish to make a difference, build positive reputations, become leaders, and advance in their careers must cultivate professional success skills, along with their specific job skills. The central themes of this course – knowing yourself and your values, recognizing and meeting ethical challenges, using an analytical decision-making framework, identifying potential pitfalls, and developing tools to use in the moment – are essential skills for succeeding at work. In short, an ethical framework is necessary, and not just nice; smart ethics, as we define them, are integral to success.",

In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.\n\nA few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following:\n1. What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array?\n2. How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python?\n3. How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average?\n4. What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced? \n\nYou will also learn how services like Dropbox manage to upload some large files instantly and to save a lot of storage space!",

Os conceitos discutidos e experimentados por você neste curso serão a base para você poder compreender os novos conceitos apresentados nos cursos seguintes desta especialização.\n\nOs conceitos Java apresentados neste curso incluem o seguinte: revisão de conceitos básicos de orientação a objetos, tais como classes, objetos, métodos e atributos, variáveis de instância e de classe; responsabilidades, colaborações e cartões CRC; testes de unidade, uso de plataforma IDE como o Eclipse; herança, classes concretas e abstratas, interfaces, modificadores de acesso, encapsulamento, métodos de acesso; aprofundamento nos conceitos de polimorfismo, sobrecarga e sobreposição; associação de classes, agregação e composição; exceções, delegação e acoplamento abstrato. Em seguida, vocês serão apresentados aos principais princípios usados para organizar o desenvolvimento de programas orientados a objetos com qualidade, dentre os quais, os princípios \"Tell, Don't Ask!\" e \"Law of Demeter\". Sempre que conveniente, cada conceito será representado por meio de diagramas  UML. Você será exposto a propriedades e anotações em Java.\n\nAo final deste curso, você terá amadurecido de tal modo suas habilidades de programação que você será capaz de implementar versões iniciais do componente de gamificação constante do Trabalho de Conclusão da Especialização, com base nas boas práticas exercitadas neste curso.",

To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer, healthier lives.\n\nView the trailer for the course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7x1aaZ03xU",

As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem – the World Center for Holocaust Research. This course is the second of the two courses and covers three themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: The Final Solution\nWe’ll look at the cultural and mental processes that paved the way to the comprehensive and systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe – that is, the Final Solution. As part of this hard lesson we will discuss the various characteristics of the murder sites and death camps, and reveal selected aspects of the horror that occurred in them. \n\nWeek 2: Jewish and Non-Jewish Responses to the Holocaust\nWe will try to explore questions regarding knowledge about the application of the Final Solution, as well as a variety of responses and annihilation of victims, local populations and perpetrators.\n\nWeek 3: The End of the War\nWe will dedicate this lesson to the events that occurred in the last years of the Holocaust, as well as questions of memory, commemoration and future research. \n\nWe strongly recommend that you register for \"The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World\" as well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about The Holocaust.\n\nThis online course is offered in an innovative, multi-level format, comprising: \n\nComprehensive lectures by leading researchers from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem.\nA wealth of voices and viewpoints presented by guest lecturers\nNumerous documents, photos, testimonies and works of art from the time of the Holocaust.\nNovel learning experience: Crowdsourcing – involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.",

    "description": "There are six basic principals that can be used to explain how music can influence individual and community health and wellbeing. From biology and neuroscience, to psychotherapy and politics, the ways we engage with music can make all the difference. Music has always played an integral role in the lives of individuals and communities all around the globe.  This course explores the ways that music can be used to achieve positive changes with a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable persons.  Six different understandings will be explored, each with their own set of values and assumptions.  The greatest thinkers in each approach believe that their way of explaining the power of music is right, but we will show that understanding music in its entirety delivers the best results in each unique circumstance.  Once we understand the various ways that music can change the world, we can make informed decisions about how best to employ its extraordinary power.\nMusic can influence our bodies, rousing us to exercise and supporting us to rehabilitate injured limbs.  Music can also motivate our minds by assisting us to rehearse and conquer knowledge and skills.  Music also reflects our psyche, providing us with information about our inner worlds through the songs that we resonate with or the ways that we play.  Music also fosters bonding between people, from infants and their parents, to new love and sweet memories when people play ‘our song’.  Music has also been used as a political weapon, with the capacity to protest against inequity and to bring people together to advocate for change.  Finally, music expresses culture through the tiny details of the musical parts and the ways that different groups of peoples express who they are and where they have come from.\nLearner’s who engage in this MOOC can expect to both deepen and broaden their understanding of how music can be used with individuals, groups and communities.  Specifically:\n\t•\tTo distinguish between how music works on the body, in the brain, through the unconscious, for bonding, as political action and in reflecting culture,\n\t•\tTo design practical programs that utilise music to support individuals, groups and communities based on examples shared in the ‘on-site’ case studies.",

Teniendo esto en mente, y tras demostrar cómo la fijación de precios es el factor conductor más importante de la rentabilidad, cuando termine este módulo podrá llevar a cabo fijaciones de precios basadas en clientes, en la competencia y en costes. Asimismo, podrá utilizar los conceptos de elasticidad del precio y el precio óptimo al fijar los precios de sus productos y servicios. \n\n2 - Tras finalizar este módulo, podrá aprovechar los cuatro métodos distintos para determinar la disposición a pagar de los clientes. Ya se utilicen opciones como datos de mercado o experimentos (basados en observación) o encuestas a expertos o clientes (basadas en encuestas), podrá utilizar esta información para identificar el precio óptimo.\n\n3 - Lo que vemos en el mundo real es que las empresas no cobran un mismo precio por todos sus productos, sino más bien que fijan precios distintos para productos diferentes con respecto a los diversos segmentos de clientes. Tras estudiar las ventajas de la discriminación de precios (y el significativo potencial en cuanto a ingresos y beneficios que conlleva), podrá entender el tipo de discriminación de precios y la forma de implantarlo en sus productos y servicios.\n\n4 - En este módulo final, hablaremos de la psicología que hay detrás de la fijación de precios. De esta forma, podrá «manipular» a los clientes de modo que perciban un valor superior en los productos y servicios que produce, o les cueste menos pagar el precio de compra de sus productos.  Tendrá a su disposición diversas maneras de maximizar sus ventas, ingresos y rentabilidad. También realizaremos un par de experimentos con clientes voluntarios para ver cómo el precio afecta en las percepciones, y cómo puede beneficiarse de ello.",

    "description": "This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.\n\n The course will explore seven topics:\n\n 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.\n\n 2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.\n\n 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.\n\n 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\n\n 5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.\n\n 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.\n\n 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.",

Once enrolled you can access the license in the Resources area <<<\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an area of rapid growth and opportunity. Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications, coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\nThis course is an entry level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based IBM Watson IoT Platform. \n\nWhat you will learn: \nQuickly create applications that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment, on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data. \n \nWhat technology is required to complete the course?  \nThe programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.\nYou will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform, develop and deploy your IoT solution.\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\nTo work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\n\nWhat prerequisite skills are required ?\nThis is an entry level course, but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required.\n\nWhat additional resources do I need for this course? \nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\nWhen your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix. Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform to complete the course.",

We will learn about the philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data. We will compare the Bayesian approach to the more commonly-taught Frequentist approach, and see some of the benefits of the Bayesian approach. In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty, results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source, freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will give you an understanding of the concepts of the Bayesian approach, understanding the key differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, and the ability to do basic data analyses.",

    "description": "With a fixed capacity, a highly disposable product and high fixed costs, hotels are a natural candidate for the application of revenue management. Originally developed by the airlines in the 1970s, these analytics-based techniques help predict consumer behavior at the hotel’s market level so that the hotel can sell each room each night at the optimum price. \n\nWith modern-day rising acquisition costs and distribution complexities, revenue management techniques have increasingly been adopted by both small and large hotel companies, making a comprehensive understanding of segmentation, forecasting and pricing an essential requirement for today’s hospitality professionals. The purpose of this course is to provide a core understanding of the fundamentals of revenue management, which ties into the larger picture of revenue strategy. The course is structured to provide an insightful look into Revenue Management.\n\nCreated in conjunction with Duetto, this course is hosted by a group of revenue management leaders in both theory and with hands-on experience at properties around the world. Upon completion of the course students should be empowered with industry best practices, which can be applied across the vast diversification the hotel industry to empower those to optimize profits. Duetto delivers powerful revenue strategy solutions to the world’s leading hotels and casinos, combining unparalleled expertise with world-class cloud-based technology.\n\nAcknowledgement: Bela Nagy, Agnes Roquefort , Jonathon Liu, Frederic Toitot, Pierrick La Masne, Markus Keller - ACCOR Simone Truscello -  ACE HOTELS.

    "description": "Il s’agit d’un MOOC sur la crise internationale sur Ebola partie d’Afrique de l’Ouest en 2014 ; d’une durée de 5 semaines, où interviendront plus de 30 professeurs des universités, chercheurs, responsables politiques, autorités sanitaires nationales et internationales, membres d’ONGs, et autres acteurs d’Europe et d’Afrique sur plus de 60 séquences vidéos. Les thèmes abordés se dérouleront selon une séquence hebdomadaire décrite ci-dessous (section « plan du cours »).\n\nLe virus Ebola qui a été à l’origine de l’épidémie en Afrique de l’Ouest est une souche Zaïre, considérée comme la plus dangereuse. Cependant le spectre des tableaux cliniques rencontrés s’est montré très large : depuis des formes assez bénignes (pour environ 30% des infections), jusqu’à des formes très sévères, presque hors de toute ressources thérapeutiques et fréquemment mortelles en une dizaine de jours en moyenne (environ 30%), en passant par des formes d’une gravité dépendant de l’infrastructure sanitaire responsable de leur prise en charge (c’est-à-dire généralement de bon pronostic en cas de bonne prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique). Près de 60% des contaminations en Afrique avaient comme origine les rites funéraires non sécurisés. Les personnels de santé exposés ont également payé un très lourd tribut à l’épidémie. Enfin les conséquences non sanitaires, d’ordre social, politique et économique de l’épidémie ont été considérables, tant localement, que régionalement ou internationalement. Peu de pays ont connu à ce jour d’importants développements de chaînes de contaminations, en dehors de la Guinée, du Libéria et du Sierra Leone, mais la situation au Mali à la fin novembre 2014 était encore source d’incertitude et d’inquiétude. Les modèles mathématiques, s’ils ont été d’un apport précieux dans l’éclairage des politiques publiques, ils ont aussi participé à une amplification exagérée du problème, notamment lorsqu’ils ont livré des prévisions allant au-delà de plusieurs mois, parfois endossées par de grandes agences sanitaires, car elles risquent de se révéler fausses et décrédibilisantes.\n\nNous tenterons de mieux savoir quels espoirs on peut avoir de disposer d’un vaccin prochainement, et nous essaierons de comprendre pourquoi il aura fallu attendre 38 ans, depuis la découverte du virus Ebola, pour que la communauté internationale se décide à chercher et développer un vaccin contre ce type de virus que l’on savait hautement pathogène et contagieux. La réponse internationale a-t-elle été à la hauteur des enjeux ? L’OMS a-t-elle pu mettre en œuvre le Règlement Sanitaire International dans des conditions satisfaisantes ? Quelle a été la place des ONG dans le règlement du problème ? Toutes ces questions feront l’objet, au cours de ce MOOC, de débats et de points de vue interdisciplinaires, parfois contradictoires. De même, l’importance de la communication, le rôle des médias, la perception du risque par la population et par les décideurs eux-mêmes seront analysés. Une large plage sera réservée aux réponses aux questions des participants adressées aux orateurs par le forum de discussion, afin de réfléchir comment vaincre ensemble Ebola.\n\nPUBLIC CIBLE\nCe MOOC est ouvert et gratuit pour tous les publics. Le public cible est principalement le milieu des soignants francophones et les acteurs (publics et privés) des politiques publiques.\n\nPLAN DU COURS\nModule 1: Présentation générale\nModule 2 : Comprendre la maladie\nles aspects cliniques\nles aspects virologiques\nles aspects immunologiques\nles traitements symptomatiques actuels\nl’épidémiologie de la maladie\n\nModule 3 : Ebola comme symptômes d’un désordre social et politique\nles causes sociales économiques et politiques du problème\nla faiblesse du système\nles aspects culturels\nla pauvreté\n\nModule 4 : Les impacts sur nos vies et nos sociétés\nles impacts sanitaires et économiques sur la société et les institutions\nprésentation de modèles mathématiques et prévisions\n\nModule  5 : Les réponses pour l’Afrique et le monde\nles interventions\nla prise en charge des malades\nles principaux obstacles rencontrés\nla réponse internationale\nla perception du risque\nles développements de médicaments et vaccins\nle volet éthique\nla réponse de l'OMS\nla place de la recherche et des médias\n\nModule 6 : Conclusion\n\n_________________________________\nCe cours est co-produit par l'Université de Genève (UNIGE) et l'Université Numérique Francophone des Sciences du Sport et de la Santé (UNF3S).\nIl est proposé en partenariat avec :\nL'Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF)\nLe Conseil supérieur de la Formation et de la Recherche Stratégique (CSFRS)\nL'Organisation Mondiale de la Santé (OMS)\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF)\nSwiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)\nFédération Internationale des Sociétés de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (FISCR)\nCentre Virchow Villermé de santé publique Paris-Berlin\nRadio Télévision Suisse (RTS)\nOffice fédéral de la santé publique (OFSP)\nHôpitaux Universitaires de Genève (HUG)\nInstitut Pasteur\nCampus Biotech\nInfection Control African Network (ICAN)\nThe Graduate Institute Geneva\nMinistère de la Santé et de l'Action Sociale du Sénégal",

    "description": "How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important. This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWe encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think. Think Again: Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think.\n\nIn this course, you will learn about fallacies. Fallacies are arguments that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects:  equivocation, circularity, vagueness, etc. It’s important to learn about fallacies so that you can recognize them when you see them, and not be fooled by them. It’s also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 13-17, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

    "description": "Welcome!\nDo you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions with data analysis tools? Then Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you, as you learn how to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making.\n\n* What do I learn?\nWhen you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training exercises. \n\n* Do I need prior knowledge?\nThe course is suitable for (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in the Building Blocks module. \n\n* What literature can I consult to support my studies?\nYou can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources. Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press. The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in the Course Guide – Further Information – How can I continue my studies.\n\n* Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?\nStaff and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance. We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss topics and exercises.\n\n* How will I get a certificate?\nTo gain the certificate of this course, you are asked to make six Test Exercises (one per module) and a Case Project. Further, you perform peer-reviewing activities of the work of three of your fellow learners of this MOOC. You gain the certificate if you pass all seven assignments.\n\nHave a nice journey into the world of Econometrics!\nThe Econometrics team",

Even the most sophisticated statistical analyses are not useful to a business if they do not lead to actionable advice, or if the answers to those business questions are not conveyed in a way that non-technical people can understand.  \n\nIn this course you will learn how to become a master at communicating business-relevant implications of data analyses.  By the end, you will know how to structure your data analysis projects to ensure the fruits of your hard labor yield results for your stakeholders.  You will also know how to streamline your analyses and highlight their implications efficiently using visualizations in Tableau, the most popular visualization program in the business world.  Using other Tableau features, you will be able to make effective visualizations that harness the human brain’s innate perceptual and cognitive tendencies to convey conclusions directly and clearly.  Finally, you will be practiced in designing and persuasively presenting business “data stories” that use these visualizations, capitalizing on business-tested methods and design principles.",

L'objectif est de découvrir et comprendre comment améliorer la gouvernance et la gestion de ces territoires uniques. \n\nLe cours fournit une connaissance globale des éléments clés de la gestion et de la gouvernance des aires protégées en Afrique.\nDans chacun des sept modules du cours, nous abordons un thème clef relatif à la conservation de la nature au travers des aires protégées. Nous verrons les concepts à comprendre au préalable, la planification, à toutes ses échelles, la gouvernance et ses multiples ressorts, l’efficacité de la gestion pour de meilleurs impacts, les techniques à employer sur le terrain, le financement de la conservation et enfin l’actualité brûlante du moment.  Nous parlerons d’aménagement du territoire, de transfrontalier, de connectivité, de surveillance, de restauration des sites, d’éducation environnementale, d’équité, de services des écosystèmes, de populations locales, de tourisme, de climat, d’aires marines protégées, de conventions internationales… bref de tout ce qu’il faut connaître pour pouvoir conserver durablement ces aires protégées.\n\nDe nombreux intervenants prendront la parole et viendront illustrer par leur expérience de terrain les cours coordonnés par les quatre intervenants principaux, partenaires du RESCIF : Paul Ndiaye, de l’UCAD à Dakar, Paul Ouedraogo, du secrétariat de la Convention RAMSAR, Sylvie Goyet qui a dirigé la Fondation Internationale du Banc d’Arguin et Geoffroy Mauvais, qui est de l’Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN-Papaco) et collaborateur externe au Collège des Humanités de l’EPFL. Le MOOC est coproduit par André Hoffmann, UICN-Papaco et l’EPFL.\n\nSi vous avez des questions sur le MOOC n'hésitez pas à consulter le guide du MOOC (en français : http://papaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Guide-MOOC_FR.pdf et en anglais : http://papaco.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Guide-MOOC_ENG.pdf).\n\nFAQ\n\nQ : Quelles sont les connaissances nécessaires pour profiter au mieux du cours ?\nR : Le Mooc a été développé pour apporter une information générale au travers des vidéos et permettre un approfondissement volontaire au travers des documents consultables. Que vous soyez novice ou professionnel de la conservation, vous pourrez donc trouver le niveau d’information qui vous intéresse.\n\n \nQ : Quels sont les aspects les plus remarquables de ce cours ?\nR : Le cours est construit sur les meilleures pratiques proposées par la commission mondiale des aires protégées et fait appel à de nombreux experts pour illustrer leurs principes afin de passer de la théorie à la pratique. Bien que général, le cours s’attache à illustrer concrètement les concepts évoqués.\n\n \nQ : Quelle est la spécificité de ce cours sur la conservation de la nature ?\nR : Le cours aborde la conservation de la nature au travers de la gestion et de la gouvernance des aires protégées, en prenant l’exemple du continent africain. Les leçons apprises sont utilisables partout cependant, en les adaptant aux contextes des autres zones géographiques.\n \n\nQ : Quelles ressources sont nécessaires pour suivre le cours ?\nR : Aucun support de cours n’est nécessaire. L’information principale est présentée dans les vidéos et des documents, sites web, publications… sont proposés en complément. Un résumé des principaux points à connaître est aussi préparé pour la plupart des thèmes abordés.\n\n \nQ : Comment vais-je interagir avec les autres inscrits à ce Mooc ?\nR : Un forum sera mis en place dès le début du cours permettant de recueillir les questions, les remarques, les critiques et les suggestions de tous. Des sujets pouvant faire l’objet de débats seront proposés et animés et les participants souhaitant rejoindre le réseau des acteurs de la conservation déjà constitué par l’UICN-Papaco pourront le faire volontairement. Le MOOC a aussi un groupe Facebook sur lesquels tous les inscrits peuvent échanger : https://www.facebook.com/groups/167668443583415/. \n\n \nQ : Quelle reconnaissance du cours si je passe tous les examens ?\nR : Chaque module, un examen permettra de valider les connaissances acquises. Les participants ayant passé avec succès tous les examens peuvent recevoir une attestation de réussite de Coursera. Les étudiants peuvent aussi passer un examen en présentiel, ce qui leur permettra de recevoir une attestation de l'EPFL et de l'UICN et 2 crédits universitaires (ECTS).\n\n \nQ : Quelles suites peut-on envisager ?\nR : Si vous rejoignez le réseau de l’UICN-Papaco, vous recevrez tous les mois la lettre sur les AP d’Afrique. Ceux et celles qui auront obtenu l’attestation de réussite au Mooc pourront aussi bénéficier (sous réserve de prérequis académiques) d’un accès privilégié aux formations en présentiel organisées par l’UICN-Papaco (Diplôme d’université en 8 semaines ou Master en 2 ans).",

    "description": "Energy issues have always been important in international relations, but in recent years may have become even more important than in the past due to the widespread awareness of existing limits to energy sources and negative climate impacts. The course discusses global trends in energy consumption and production, various available scenarios for potential developments in the coming decades, the availability of oil reserves and the evolution of the oil industry. It then discusses natural gas and highlights the differences between oil and gas. It will also discuss renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and EU energy policy.\n\nThe course aims at providing students whose main interest is in international relations a background on energy resources, technology and economic realities to allow them to correctly interpret the political impact of current developments. It also aims at providing students, who already have a technical background in energy science or engineering, with the broad global view of energy issues that will allow them to better understand the social, economic and political impact of their technical knowledge.\n\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR :\n\nGiacomo Luciani\n\nScientific Advisor for the Master in International Energy at the Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) Sciences Po, Giacomo Luciani is also Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva and Director of the Executive Master in International Oil and Gas Leadership. For the period 2010-13 he was appointed Princeton University Global Scholar, attached to the Woodrow Wilson School and the Department of Near Eastern Studies. His research focuses on the political economy of the Middle East and North Africa and on global energy issues.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND :\n\nThe course requires no special scientific, mathematical or economic background; all key concepts are clearly and elementarily explained. It is expected that it will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students in schools where an equivalent course is not offered (this being the case for the vast majority of schools).\n\n\nUSPC\nSorbonne Paris Cité\nSupported by Université Sorbonne Paris Cité\n\n\nIDEX\nInvestissements d'Avenir\nFunded by Investissements d'Avenir - 'ANR.\n\nInfo : \nCourse content : Licence Creative Commons BY NC SA",

    "description": "The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.",

Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session, our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.\n\nWith this objective in mind, the focus in this Capstone class will be an exam whose questions are updated periodically. This approach is designed to help insure that each student is solving the exam problems on his/her own without outside help. For students that have done their own work, we do not anticipate that the exam will be particularly hard. However, those students who have relied too heavily on outside help in previous classes may have a difficult time. We believe that this approach will increase the value of the Certificate for this specialization.",

It start in its first module by introducing the key macroeconomic variables and explaining how they are defined and measured in order to enable the students to interpret macroeconomic data properly.\n\nIn the second module, the course offers a perspective for separating out various parts of the economy driven by different processes and for combining those components to develop a richer view of the whole. In particular, it applies this approach to the analysis of the relationship of the trade deficit with the budget deficit and private savings, offering insights about some key determinants of the balance of payments.\n\nThe third and fourth modules focus on the analyses of the foreign currency and money markets to provide fundamental models of the interest rate and exchange rate determination. They also discuss how these variables interact with each other and with the macroeconomic conditions, particularly monetary policy and the expectations about the future trends in the economy. These analyses lay the foundation for more comprehensive models of the macroeconomy in the next course of the Managerial Economics and Business Analysis Specialization.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tSystematically assess the national and international economic environment in which you live and work.\n•\tAnalyze macroeconomic issues using key tools.\n•\tBe a more effective professional in your line of activity.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

You’ll never have to avoid telling an employee “the truth” again, because the seven techniques we teach will not make employees defensive or afraid. As a manager, or someone who would like to be a manager, you’ll also learn specifically what feedback is, how negative feedback is weighed more heavily than positive, and how positive feedback can super-charge behaviors such as creativity and teamwork.\n\nGiving feedback is a skill which develops over time. We give you a process you can use to improve your feedback skills and deliver it with confidence. You will find that there is a scientific basis for many of your observations and intuitions about feedback—such as, it is hard to give correctly, people don’t like it, and more. This will be reassuring as you learn how to overcome these difficulties. We hope you have a fantastic time becoming a better manager!",

    "description": "Have you ever had the perfect data science experience? The data pull went perfectly. There were no merging errors or missing data. Hypotheses were clearly defined prior to analyses. Randomization was performed for the treatment of interest. The analytic plan was outlined prior to analysis and followed exactly. The conclusions were clear and actionable decisions were obvious. Has that every happened to you? Of course not. Data analysis in real life is messy. How does one manage a team facing real data analyses? In this one-week course, we contrast the ideal with what happens in real life. By contrasting the ideal, you will learn key concepts that will help you manage real life analyses. \n\nThis is a focused course designed to rapidly get you up to speed on doing data science in real life. Our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without sacrificing any essential content. We've left the technical information aside so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward.\n\nAfter completing this course you will know how to:\n\n1, Describe the “perfect” data science experience\n2. Identify strengths and weaknesses in experimental designs\n3. Describe possible pitfalls when pulling / assembling data and learn solutions for managing data pulls.\n4. Challenge statistical modeling assumptions and drive feedback to data analysts\n5. Describe common pitfalls in communicating data analyses\n6. Get a glimpse into a day in the life of a data analysis manager.\n\nThe course will be taught at a conceptual level for active managers of data scientists and statisticians.  Some key concepts being discussed include:\n1. Experimental design, randomization, A/B testing\n2. Causal inference, counterfactuals, \n3. Strategies for managing data quality.\n4. Bias and confounding\n5. Contrasting machine learning versus classical statistical inference\n\nCourse promo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIYmw5wnBI\n\nCourse cover image by Jonathan Gross.

    "description": "Case Study - Predicting Housing Prices\n\nIn our first case study, predicting house prices, you will create models that predict a continuous value (price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).  This is just one of the many places where regression can be applied.  Other applications range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression.\n\nIn this course, you will explore regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection.  You will be able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity.  You will also analyze the impact of aspects of your data -- such as outliers -- on your selected models and predictions.  To fit these models, you will implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a regression model.\n   -Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.\n   -Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.\n   -Tune parameters with cross validation.\n   -Analyze the performance of the model.\n   -Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.\n   -Deploy methods to select between models.\n   -Exploit the model to form predictions. \n   -Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python.",

Individuals, corporations, and national governments make financial and policy decisions based on the cost, use, and availability of these two natural resources. This two-week course looks at the two most fundamental aspects of the oil and gas industry, its operations and markets, each of which is addressed as a separate module in the course. In the operations module, the course provides an overview of the production of oil and gas, from initial exploration to final transport. The second module focuses on the forces that drive the industry's operations, the oil and gas markets, including the cost of wells, seasonal impacts on prices, and the role of oil reserves. After every lesson, learners will take short quizzes to test their newly acquired knowledge, participant in crowd-sourced discussions about global markets, and complete a final project.",

The overall course paradigm is the Institute of Medicine's vision of a \"Learning Health System\" that uses data from actual patient care to gain new knowledge and feeds that knowledge back as care is delivered to achieve a safer, higher quality and more cost effective health delivery system. Module 1 covers the US healthcare delivery system's unique structural, economic and policy issues and the strategic role for health informatics. It also looks at the federal programs to encourage adoption of electronic record systems. Module 2 gives a high level overview of some key health standards with a particular emphasis on the new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard. Module 3 explores how these technologies are being deployed and some of their current limitations using specific commercial and open source systems as examples. It features an interview with the developers of an innovative, new EHR. Module 4 presents examples of cutting edge research using \"big data\" and shows how analytic based tools are helping overcome some of the challenges posed in the prior module. It features an interview with developers of a innovative cloud-based service to bring together datasets and analytic tools from diverse sources. Optionally, as the course progresses, students read the instructor’s book, Practitioner's Guide to Health Informatics.",

    "description": "In this project-centered course, you will learn everything you need to research and present an effective and persuasive position paper or policy advice. We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share",

    "description": "This course introduces participants from the healthcare sector to gender based violence (GBV), including global epidemiology of GBV; health outcomes; seminal research; and clinical best practices for GBV prevention, support, and management. A core curriculum is supplemented by lectures that contextualize the content with specific examples and programs from around the world. The core curriculum introduces learners to a global perspective on gender based violence (GBV), and includes a review with Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno of the new WHO guidelines on responding to violence. Students who wish to receive Honors Recognition will complete the honors module, which expands on the core material and highlights special circumstances and programs. \n\nThis is an in-depth course with 2 components: \n1) Core curriculum introduces GBV from a global perspective, with an emphasis on ensuring a strong health sector response to GBV and teaching key competencies for social workers, physicians, nurses, midwives, community health workers, counselors, and other healthcare workers. Completion of the core content is required for students to pass the course. \n2) Honors curriculum offered by experts from around the world helps students dive deeper into certain issues, and touches on unique populations and specialized topics. Completion of Honors curriculum is required for those students who wish to receive a Certificate of Accomplishment with Honors.\n\nAfter taking the course, students will be able to:\n●\tDescribe the global epidemiology of leading forms of GBV and the evidence linking GBV to poor health.\n●\tArticulate the challenges, strategies, and WHO guidelines for integrating GBV response within the health sector. \n●\tDescribe the components of a comprehensive clinical assessment, treatment, and management of a GBV survivor.\n●\tDescribe the appropriate psychosocial support and management of a GBV survivor.\n\nModule 1 – Introduction to GBV- Epidemiology and Health Impact\nGBV comes in a variety of forms, each with health consequences for the survivor. An understanding of these issues helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 – Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 – Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module – In-Depth Information and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon, and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and human trafficking. Further information is provided on epidemiology, policy, and ethical guidelines, as well as the use of mHealth in GBV screening and care. We’ll cover the unique challenges of GBV research, and explore programs that encourage men and boys to be engaged in the prevention of violence against women. \n\nAcknowledgments\nThis course is a project of the Johns Hopkins Center for Clinical Global Health Education.

Welcome to advanced neurobiology!\n\nNeuroscience is a wonderful branch of science on how our brain perceives the external world, how our brain thinks, how our brain responds to the outside of the world, and how during disease or aging the neuronal connections deteriorate. We’re trying to understand the molecular, cellular nature and the circuitry arrangement of how nervous system works.\n\nThrough this course, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of basic neuroanatomy, electral signal transduction, movement and several diseases in the nervous system. \n\nThis advanced neurobiology course is composed of 2 parts (Advanced neurobiology I and Advanced neurobiology II, and the latter will be online in late April or May). They are related to each other on the content but separate on scoring and certification, so you can choose either or both. It’s recommended that you take them sequentially and it’s great if you’ve already acquired a basic understanding of biology.\n\nThank you for joining us!",

    "description": "If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\" is the first part of a two part course and it includes the following four lectures: \n(1) What do we need a state for? \n(2) The Relationship between Efficiency and Distributive Justice \n(3) Demonstrating the implications of different ethical theories  \n(4) Distributive Justice: measurement and implications\nOnce you've completed the first part, we strongly recommend that you register for the second part entitled: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - Maximizing Social Well-being\", as well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.",

This course covers the music of Led Zeppelin, the Allman Brothers, Carole King, Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols, Donna Summer, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Metallica, Run-DMC, and Nirvana, and many more artists, with an emphasis both on cultural context and on the music itself. We will also explore how developments in the music business and in technology helped shape the ways in which styles developed. \n\nEmerging out of the experimental and ambitious years of late-60s psychedelia, rock splintered into a variety of styles in the 1970s as the music business continued to expand. By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s. Nirvana leads alt-rock's return to simplicity in the early 1990s.",

    "description": "This course is an advanced study of bodies in motion as applied to engineering systems and structures.  We will study the dynamics of rigid bodies in 3D motion.  This will consist of both the kinematics and kinetics of motion.  Kinematics deals with the geometrical aspects of motion describing position, velocity, and acceleration, all as a function of time.  Kinetics is the study of forces acting on these bodies and how it affects their motion.\n---------------------------\nRecommended Background:\n\nTo be successful in the course you will need to have mastered basic engineering mechanics concepts and to have successfully completed my course entitled Engineering Systems in Motion: Dynamics of Particles and Bodies in 2D Motion.”   We will apply many of the engineering fundamentals learned in those classes and you will need those skills before attempting this course.\n\n---------------------------\nSuggested Readings:\n\nWhile no specific textbook is required, this course is designed to be compatible with any standard engineering dynamics textbook.  You will find a book like this useful as a reference and for completing additional practice problems to enhance your learning of the material.\n\n---------------------------\nThe copyright of all content and materials in this course are owned by either the Georgia Tech Research Corporation or Dr. Wayne Whiteman.

    "description": "Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la mise en place de services d’infrastructures, en particulier dans les économies émergentes. Les participants bénéficieront de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience de terrain, sur les opportunités et les défis que présentent la mise en place et la maintenance d’infrastructures affectées aux services publics par des PPP efficaces.\n\nLe cours comprend des films vidéo, des lectures, des questionnaires et autres matériels d’apprentissage conçus et enseignés par des experts notamment de l’Université d’Harvard, l’Université John Hopkins, L’université de la Sorbonne, l’Université Panthéon-Assas, la Facilité Africaine de Soutien Juridique, la Banque d’Investissement Européenne, le Fond Monétaire International, l’Agence Française de Développement, et la Banque mondiale.\n\nCe cours vous apportera ce dont vous avez besoin pour mieux comprendre les PPP, que vous soyez un membre de la société civile, du grand public, un praticien, un fonctionnaire d’état ou un décideur politique.\n\n~~ A propos du cours\n\nPartout dans le monde et en particulier dans les pays en développement, les gouvernements rencontrent des difficultés pour mettre en place et maintenir les infrastructures nécessaires à la croissance économique de leur pays et à la prestation de services publics de base aux citoyens. Les partenariats public-privés (PPP) sont un des outils que les gouvernements peuvent utiliser pour contribuer à la mise en place de meilleurs services publics. Ce cours vous permettra de comprendre les principes clés des PPP et le rôle qu’ils peuvent jouer dans la réduction du déficit d’infrastructures. Le cours présentera les difficultés et les défis rencontrés lors de la sélection des projets jusqu’à leur mise en œuvre. Ainsi, vous améliorerez votre compréhension sur l’opportunité ou non de recourir à un PPP pour développer un projet d’infrastructure.\n\nDurant ce cours de quatre semaines, vous bénéficierez de l’expertise de praticiens, de hauts fonctionnaires d’état, et d’universitaires ayant une véritable expérience transactionnelle pour approfondir vos connaissances.\nPlusieurs ressources seront proposées chaque semaine, tels des films vidéos d’experts et de praticiens, des lectures obligatoires et facultatives, un questionnaire à choix multiples portant sur le thème de la semaine, et des exercices pour parfaire vos compétences d’analyse, de réflexion et de communication.\n\n~~ Semaine 1: Réduire le déficit d’infrastructure : le rôle des PPP\n\nCe premier module explique comment et pourquoi l’expertise et les ressources du secteur privé peuvent être mobilisées par les gouvernements pour contribuer à la réduction de leur déficit d’infrastructures. Ce module introduit le concept de PPP, ses caractéristiques, et les types de modalités contractuelles reflétant le degré de participation du secteur privé. Les PPP ne regroupent pas tous les contrats entre une personne publique et une personne privée, et ce module définit également ce que n’est pas un PPP. Des exemples d’échecs ou de PPP réussis seront utilisés pour illustrer les conditions optimales pour réussir des projets, et pour souligner la nécessité d’une analyse précise, ainsi que l’importance de la durabilité, la participation des acteurs et la bonne gouvernance des PPP.\n\n~~ Semaine 2: Prendre les bonnes décisions: les cadres législatifs et institutionnels dédiés aux PPP\n\nCe module examine les principes, valeurs et défis que requièrent la mise en place d’un cadre facilitant l’exécution des projets de PPP dans l’optique d’améliorer les services publics et l’investissement en infrastructure. Vous bénéficierez des leçons apprises lors de la réalisation des PPP et de leur incorporation dans des cadres législatifs efficaces. La semaine 2 vous apportera également une vue d’ensemble des différentes étapes du cycle de vie des PPP et approfondira la première phase : l’identification et la sélection des projets.\n\n~~ Semaine 3: Susciter l’engagement du partenaire approprié: la passation des PPP\n\nCe module débute par une discussion sur la nécessité de développer des arguments commerciaux solides pour transformer un projet en PPP, et insiste sur l’importance de la structure du partenariat pour garantir une répartition des risques appropriée entre les commanditaires privés, les bailleurs de fonds, et le gouvernement. Ce module passe en revue les différentes étapes du processus d’appel d’offres et explique les défis rencontrés pour parvenir à un bon résultat, et explique le rôle des bailleurs qui sont souvent des acteurs clés dans la structuration de l’appel d’offre.\n\n~~ Semaine 4: Obtenir un partenariat réussi: la mise en œuvre du PPP \n\nCe module présente les aspects fondamentaux et les difficultés dans la gestion des contrats, tels que l’application de l’exécution du contrat, et sa renégociation ou sa résiliation. Enfin, ce module couvre la gestion des offres non sollicitées qui, bien qu’en dehors d’un processus de mise en concurrence, peuvent être une source d’idées innovantes.\n\n~~ Comment bénéficier au maximum de ce cours? Interagir et approfondir\n\nLes participants peuvent choisir l’un des deux parcours « Compréhension des PPP » ou « Politique et Pratique des PPP » en fonction de leur intérêt et objectifs professionnels. Le parcours « Compréhension des PPP » vise les personnes ayant un intérêt général pour les PPP et désirant améliorer leur compréhension du sujet. Le parcours permet aux auditeurs de se familiariser avec les concepts de base des PPP et leurs principaux outils, et offre la possibilité de communiquer avec des professionnels et des praticiens. Le parcours « Politique et Pratique des PPP » est destiné aux auditeurs souhaitant obtenir une meilleure connaissance des PPP et approfondir leur apprentissage.\n\nQuel que soit le parcours choisi, des questions seront soulevées et des points clés seront discutés sur le forum Coursera tout au long de la semaine. Nous espérons qu’en plus du forum de discussion, vous vous connecterez sur des réseaux sociaux (tels Twitter et Google+) pour profiter pleinement de votre participation au cours. Les membres de l’équipe de cette formation en ligne seront là pour vous aider à développer une communauté d’internautes pour favoriser votre collaboration durant le cours et au-delà.",

    "description": "L’objet de ce cours est l’étude de la restructuration des quartiers précaires des villes africaines. Il s’agit, en partant de la compréhension de leur formation, de leur organisation et de leur fonctionnement, d’examiner les modes d’intervention qui visent leur revalorisation et intégration dans les structures formelles des villes qui les accueillent.\n\nLa croissance rapide des villes s’est accompagnée, sur l’ensemble des continents, de mécanismes parfois déroutants de production urbaine qui ont mis à mal les équilibres territoriaux et sociaux des agglomérations. \n\nA  l’heure actuelle, près d’un milliard de personnes dans le monde, vivent dans des quartiers précaires, en raison des mauvaises conditions d’accueil et de la pénurie de logements. Cela est particulièrement vrai des villes africaines, où la croissance s’opère principalement en périphérie, par la création de quartiers précaires où se concentre la pauvreté urbaine.\n\nL’existence et l’extension de ce type de quartiers interrogent sur la capacité de ces villes à intégrer les populations pauvres, en même temps qu’elles révèlent les limites des politiques urbaines à planifier et réguler le développement des grandes agglomérations. La question est devenue si préoccupante que la question de la restructuration des quartiers précaires dépasse aujourd’hui le cadre strict d’une intervention physique pour se poser comme une question de développement à part entière.\n\nQuelle lecture peut-on faire de l’existence et de la prolifération des quartiers précaires en Afrique? Quelles ont été, jusqu’ici, les approches et réponses apportées par les gouvernants et les bailleurs? Quels modes et quels outils ont été expérimentés pour leur restructuration? Et quelles leçons peut-on tirer de la mise oeuvre des diverses opérations initiées au cours des années passes?",

We will explore the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory, learning, attention, perception and consciousness.  We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior.  Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.   \n\nThe fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without appreciating how interesting they are.  However, we are also routinely influenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.  By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding and appreciation of who you are and how you work.  And I can guarantee you that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family about, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself and others.

    "description": "Water management today is faced with new challenges such as climate change or the effects of human activity. Public and private stakeholders who are active in this field must develop new ways to better manage the water cycle \"as a whole\".\n\nThe objective of this MOOC is to develop an understanding of the problems related to water management. Firstly, this course will define a resource and, more specifically, the resource of water. It will look at how water is used and the activities associated with it as well as any potential conflicts. The course will look at water management in detail through the analysis of the different types of rights and obligations associated with, for example, the development of a multi-sectorial regulation system or a watershed management approach.\n\nBy the end of this course, our aim is to enable you to:\n1) Identify the main issues and strategies linked to water resource management\n2) Acquire the key reading material needed to understand the many variables (environmental, institutional and political) which affect water and which, in terms of management, may require adjustment.\n\nThis course was developed by the Geneva Water Hub and is financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Alongside researchers from the University of Geneva from a range of faculties, researchers from other universities and research centres will be involved in this course. Practitioners who deal daily with the political dimension of water management will also input into the course.\n\nThis MOOC is designed for all those interested in the water sector. Prior training is not necessary to follow our program. The findings presented in this course can be easily reapplied to different contexts and to different scales of analysis.\n\nThis course is also available in French : https://www.coursera.org/learn/gestion-eau/",

    "description": "Before the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, most scientists believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts. For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called XaoS 3.4, which is distributed by the Free Software Foundation under a GNU General Public License.",

(And then: Did it matter?)\n     Is it usable?\n     Did it break?\n\nWe'll show you how to: \n- Translate your product’s strategic direction into a user-centric charter with lots of small, testable ideas\n- Test user motivation to make sure you’re building something that matters\n- Design and conduct usability testing (even without working software)\n- Use narrative collaboration to focus your testing \n- Integrate functional testing into a more continuous release flow\n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. \n\nTopics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts. \n\nThe first part, Bioinformatic Methods I, dealt with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics. \n\nThis, the second part, Bioinformatic Methods II, will cover motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions. \n\nThis pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine.\n\nThese courses are based on one taught at the University of Toronto to upper-level undergraduates who have some understanding of basic molecular biology. If you're not familiar with this, something like https://learn.saylor.org/course/bio101 might be helpful. No programming is required for this course although some command line work (though within a web browser) occurs in the 5th module.",

    "description": "Learn about the music production process—including recording, editing, and mixing—and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.\n\nWith the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.",

Também será capaz de esboçar o diagrama de Bode de um sistema dada a sua função de transferência. Outrossim, será capaz de representar a resposta em frequência na carta de Nichols-Black.\nA fim de se determinar a estabilidade do sistema, você aprenderá a aplicar o critério de Nyquist, que faz uso da resposta em frequência em malha aberta e permite determinar se um sistema será estável em malha fechada.\nAo fim do curso, você será capaz de projetar controladores com dinâmica, isto é, com polos e zeros, portanto mais complexos do que um simples ganho de realimentação. Essa flexibilidade permitirá que você projete controladores para satisfazer simultaneamente requisitos de sobressinal e tempo de resposta que seriam impossíveis de atender com um simples ganho. Também poderá com isso alterar as características da resposta em regime estacionário, aumentando as constantes de erro sem alterar (muito) a resposta transitória.\nPor fim, você aprenderá a projetar controladores do tipo PD, PI e PID, que estão entre os mais disseminados em aplicações de engenharia de controle.",

    "description": "La mondialisation et l'européanisation favorisent le développement rapide des villes à travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? \nPour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nPlan du cours\n\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies",

Did you ever wonder how and when all this happened? Or how and when GPS sensors came to be in your cell phone?\n\nIn this course, we will explore the convergence of multiple disciplines leading to todays’ Smartphones.  You will learn about the birth and evolution of Telephony Networks, Broadcast Networks (TV and Radio) and Consumer Electronics.  We will discuss the impact of Internet, (multimedia) content, smartphones and apps on everyday lives. We will then look at how this emerging platform called the Internet of Things – wherein billions and trillions of devices communicating with each other and “the cloud” – could enable unprecedented, innovative products and services.   Take this course if you want to understand what great new advances in mobile-enabled products will be coming our way!\n\nLearning Goals: This course provides a core grounding in how science and technology have developed to enable the Internet of Things – in a way appropriate for any learner.  For those interested in developing further hands-on expertise in designing and developing for the Internet of Things, this course will provide a context to the discoveries and converging technologies that will springboard the next round of innovations.  After completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n1.\tCompare how the telephone system works (that is, peer-to-peer networks) with how media delivery works (that is, broadcast/multicast networks).\n2.\tExplain the tradeoffs between circuit switched networks (that is, dedicated resources) and packet switched networks (that is, shared resources).\n3.\tTell interesting stories about key innovations that transformed the communications, entertainment and consumer electronics industries.\n4.\tExplain how email, YouTube, SMS, etc. work.\n5.\tFind resources for those wishing to do more of a “deep-dive” into the above topics.",

    "description": "The European Union is one of the world’s largest and most important economies. This five week course is the first in a series of three that will provide students with an insight into European Business Law. The series ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on various specialized areas of law. Each course will give the students an understanding of the laws and policies that regulate the internal market of European Union, as well as relevant case law and useful inputs from leading practitioners in the field. \n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe course is useful to persons both inside and outside the European Union, whether they are students, professionals, or simply interested in the European Union and European Business Law. Prior knowledge of law and the European Union is an advantage, but not a prerequisite. We have added an introduction module in the first course providing students with an overview of the history, institutions and legal method of the European Union. \n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nIn the first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, we will examine the core structures and principles of the European Union as well as the main sources of law. In the second course, Doing business in Europe, we will focus on the main laws that regulate various aspects of establishing and running a business within the European Union. In the final course, Competing in Europe, we will go into more depth about how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. \n\nThe first course will start on January 11th 2016. We are currently working on the second and third courses in the series, and they will be launched in the spring of 2016. To keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work. A module includes a number of lectures and readings, and finishes with a voluntary assessment – a quiz, a small peer graded assignment or a case law review. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and ensure that you understand the material of the course. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary. Please note that the syllabus of the second and third courses are subject to change, as they are being revised.\n\nCourse I - Understanding the Fundamentals\n\nModule 1.\tIntroduction \nModule 2.\tLegal method and sources \nModule 3.\tConstitutional freedoms and fundamental principles \nModule 4.\tFreedom of movement \nModule 5.\tThe External Dimension \n\nCourse II - Doing Business in Europe \n\nCourse III - Competing in Europe\n\n\nFAQ\n\n1. Will I get a certificate after completing this class?\nStudents who successfully complete a course in the series will receive a Course Certificate. \n\n2. Do I earn Lund credits upon completion of this class?\nThe certificate is not part of a formal qualification from Lund University. \n\n3. What resources will I need for this class?\nThe students are not required to purchase a textbook since all readings will be provided online. All reading materials are free and will be available to use for the duration of the course.  \n\n4. What are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?\nThis course is ideal for anyone planning to work or do business in a European context. Those preparing for a legal career will also benefit from the course. Last but not least, anyone curious about European Business Law will have a great learning experience. \n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to: \n•\tNavigate EU legal sources\n•\tFind and understand relevant laws and regulations governing the internal European Union market \n•\tEstablish and run a company within the European Union \n•\tSet up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes, employ staff and navigate environmental standards and tax regulations \n•\tProtect and defend a company’s products, brands and inventions by obtaining and licensing trademarks and patents\n•\tCreate a competitive edge for a company and apply the basic principles of EU competition law\n\n5. Can I contact the course instructors directly?\nThe course staff will participate in the discussion forum and welcome questions and comments. We encourage the students to be active and engaged, interacting with other participants and sharing ideas.   \n\n\nLund University\n\nLund University was founded in 1668. The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law. The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.",

    "description": "Los cursos de Cálculo Diferencial y Cálculo Integral tradicionalmente se ofrecen separados y respetando ese orden. El primero estudia la derivada, y el segundo, la integral, siendo este momento en el que aparece el Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo (TFC) para establecer la relación entre ambos conceptos. En el presente curso vamos a hacer una diferencia: introduciremos la derivada y la integral como conceptos relacionados desde un principio. \n\nVamos a iniciar con la interpretación del Teorema Fundamental del Cálculo, con esto nos referimos a descubrir su significado real en la solución de problemas. Llegaremos a asociar con él la actividad práctica de calcular el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Habiendo realizado esta interpretación, los conceptos de derivada e integral se verán relacionados desde un principio, lo que te permitirá predecir el valor de una magnitud que está cambiando. Las nociones fundamentales de derivada e integral las identificaremos con las ideas de “razón de cambio” y de “acumulación del cambio”, y el TFC nos proveerá de la estrategia de solución.\n \nRecordarás que la Matemática Elemental incluye el Álgebra, la Geometría y la Geometría Analítica. Podemos decir que éstas son Matemáticas que estudian lo estático. En cambio, la Matemática Superior, que incluye el Cálculo, estudia lo dinámico. Con el Cálculo se inicia el estudio del cambio, una realidad presente en nuestro entorno cotidiano sin duda alguna. Costos, temperaturas, poblaciones, velocidades, energías, capitales de inversión, longitudes, etc., son algunos ejemplos de esto. En este curso podrás entender al Cálculo como una estrategia de solución para el estudio del cambio y diferenciarlo de las Matemáticas Elementales, aunque utilice de ellas bastante información.\n \nAl finalizar este curso podrás:\n\nDescribir de qué manera los modelos matemáticos polinomial, exponencial natural, y trigonométricos (seno y coseno), son una construcción que responde a esta práctica de predicción. Los verás a todos ellos surgir de esta práctica cuando una magnitud real particular cumple ciertas condiciones en su “razón de cambio” con respecto a la magnitud de la que depende. \n\nUtilizar la introducción de procesos infinitos (¡no imposibles!) en la construcción de la respuesta de predicción, con ello entenderás por qué se habla de Matemática Superior y de un pensamiento matemático avanzado.\n\nValorar una forma de pensar diferente, donde nuestro razonamiento matemático trascienda la sola manipulación de fórmulas algebraicas.",

If you're looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs.\n\nIn this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.",

It teaches how to diagnose social norms, and how to distinguish them from other social constructs, like customs or conventions. These distinctions are crucial for effective policy interventions aimed to create new, beneficial norms or eliminate harmful ones. The course teaches how to measure social norms and the expectations that support them, and how to decide whether they cause specific behaviors. We also look at a variety of tools policy makers may use to effect change, highlight the role of trendsetters in social change, and the conditions under which they can be successful. The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage, gender violence and sanitation practices.\n\nThis is Part 1 of the Social Norms, Social Change series.  In these lectures, I introduce all the basic concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences, that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement is crucial to understand the nature of the practice you are facing, but also whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why.  In Part 2, we will examine social change, the tools we may use to enact change, and put into practice all we have learned in Part 1. \n\nAll students who successfully complete the course requirements will earn a Statement of Accomplishment free of cost.",

    "description": "Interested in increasing your knowledge of the Big Data landscape?  This course is for those new to data science and interested in understanding why the Big Data Era has come to be.  It is for those who want to become conversant with the terminology and the core concepts behind big data problems, applications, and systems.  It is for those who want to start thinking about how Big Data might be useful in their business or career.  It provides an introduction to one of the most common frameworks, Hadoop, that has made big data analysis easier and more accessible -- increasing the potential for data to transform our world!\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\n* Describe the Big Data landscape including examples of real world big data problems including the three key sources of Big Data: people, organizations, and sensors. \n\n* Explain the V’s of Big Data (volume, velocity, variety, veracity, valence, and value) and why each impacts data collection, monitoring, storage, analysis and reporting.\n\n* Get value out of Big Data by using a 5-step process to structure your analysis. \n\n* Identify what are and what are not big data problems and be able to recast big data problems as data science questions.\n\n* Provide an explanation of the architectural components and programming models used for scalable big data analysis.\n\n* Summarize the features and value of core Hadoop stack components including the YARN resource and job management system, the HDFS file system and the MapReduce programming model.\n\n* Install and run a program using Hadoop!\n\nThis course is for those new to data science.  No prior programming experience is needed, although the ability to install applications and utilize a virtual machine is necessary to complete the hands-on assignments.  \n\nHardware Requirements:\n(A) Quad Core Processor (VT-x or AMD-V support recommended), 64-bit; (B) 8 GB RAM; (C) 20 GB disk free. How to find your hardware information: (Windows): Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties; (Mac): Open Overview by clicking on the Apple menu and clicking “About This Mac.” Most computers with 8 GB RAM purchased in the last 3 years will meet the minimum requirements.You will need a high speed internet connection because you will be downloading files up to 4 Gb in size.  \n\nSoftware Requirements:\nThis course relies on several open-source software tools, including Apache Hadoop. All required software can be downloaded and installed free of charge. Software requirements include: Windows 7+, Mac OS X 10.10+, Ubuntu 14.04+ or CentOS 6+ VirtualBox 5+.",

As the future leaders and drivers of growth, productivity and innovation, young people are our greatest assets, and investment in their health and wellbeing has social, economic and other benefits that continue across the lifespan and into the next generation.\n\nIn this course we will adopt a life-course framework to take a holistic view of youth health and wellbeing. We will explore changing patterns of adolescent health and development, including why adolescence is starting earlier and ending later; how puberty and adolescent brain development may shape future health; and how what happens in adolescence can affect the start to life for the next generation. We’ll also look at the major health and social issues affecting young people and ways of addressing these through policy, practice and programming.\n\nCOURSE FORMAT:\nThis course comprises short video lectures and interviews, required and recommended readings, online discussion, quizzes and written assignments. There is no required text for this course and all readings are provided.\n\nDO I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS COURSE?\nNo- you may access 100% of material in this course for free. You are also welcome to do as much or as little of the course as you like, including all (or none!) of the assessment tasks- it all depends on your learning goals. The option to pay for this course is there for those who wish to receive a Course Certificate as evidence of completion (which does require you to attempt and successfully pass the assessment tasks). \n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?\nThis course will be relevant for anyone with an interest in the health and wellbeing of young people. You do not need to be of any particular personal or professional background to benefit from this course, but having some basic undergraduate study experience will be helpful to your learning (particularly if in a health related field).\n\nWHAT IS THE MOST INTERESTING THING I'LL LEARN IF I TAKE THIS COURSE?\nYou’ll learn how so much of what happens during adolescence can impact not only the future health of individuals, but the health of the next generation as well. You’ll develop a greater understanding of the key factors impacting upon youth health and learn how to be a better advocate for the health and wellbeing of young people.",

This time will be well spent because these concepts and tools are also commonly used in many applications in the real world. The foundational idea of diversification will then be used to develop a framework for evaluating risk and establishing a relationship between risk and return. Apart from developing a keen appreciation of risk for making thoughtful decisions in an institutional context, this course will contain a lot of material and examples that will enable the learner to make smart personal investing decisions.

Content Strategy practitioners are at all levels of the best enterprises – in all departments and sectors from the top leader to the newcomer in the ranks. \n\nIn this complex information age, forward-thinking employees know that if they and their organizations are to thrive, they need to go beyond their job descriptions. They must master the most demanding communications frontier – creating engaging, strategic, honest stories and information that is valued by their most important audiences. In turn that will make their enterprise stand out. \n\nRegardless of their area of work, position or expertise, Content Strategy practitioners know how to use words, pictures, video, and social and mobile media to interact with their most important constituents with trustable, actionable information that the audience values and will use. The strategic content they produce enhances the user’s lives and deepens their understanding and engagement with the organization.\n\nGuest lecturers in this course include:\n-- Rachel Davis Mersey, Associate Professor, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Ed Malthouse, Theodore R. and Annie Laurie Sills Professor of Integrated Marketing Communications, Medill, Northwestern\n-- Bobby Calder, Charles H.

    "description": "A very beautiful classical theory on field extensions of a certain type (Galois extensions) initiated by Galois in the 19th century. Explains, in particular, why it is not possible to solve an equation of degree 5 or more in the same way as we solve quadratic or cubic equations. You will learn to compute Galois groups and (before that) study the properties of various field extensions.\n\nWe first shall survey the basic notions and properties of field extensions: algebraic, transcendental, finite field extensions, degree of an extension,  algebraic closure, decomposition field of a polynomial. \nThen we shall do a bit of commutative algebra (finite algebras over a field, base change via tensor product) and apply this  to study the notion of separability in some detail. \nAfter that we shall discuss Galois extensions and Galois correspondence and give many examples (cyclotomic extensions, finite fields, Kummer extensions, Artin-Schreier extensions, etc.). \nWe shall address the question of solvability of equations by radicals (Abel theorem). We shall also try to explain the relation to representations and to topological  coverings. \nFinally, we shall briefly discuss  extensions of rings (integral elemets, norms, traces, etc.) and explain how to use the reduction modulo primes to compute Galois groups.\n\nPREREQUISITES \nA first course in general algebra — groups, rings, fields, modules, ideals. Some knowledge of commutative algebra (prime and maximal ideals — first few pages of any book in commutative algebra) is welcome. For exercises we also shall need some elementary facts about groups and their actions on sets, groups of permutations and, marginally, \nthe statement of Sylow's theorems.\n\nASSESSMENTS\nA weekly test and two more serious exams in the middle and in the end of the course. For the final result, tests count approximately 30%, first (shorter) exam 30%, final exam 40%.\n\nThere will be two non-graded exercise lists (in replacement of the non-existent exercise classes...)",

    "description": "Cleaning up the large number of groundwater contamination sites is a significant and complex environmental challenge.  The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied.  Despite these advances, restoring groundwater contaminated by anthropogenic sources to allow for unrestricted use continues to be a challenge. Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes.\n\nWe will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes.  Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology.  \n\nAny professional working in the environmental remediation industry will benefit from this in-depth study of MNA.  We will use lectures, readings, and computational exercises to enhance our understanding and implementation of MNA.  At the completion of this course, students will have updated understanding and practical tools that can be applied to all possible MNA sites.",

    "description": "Approximation algorithms, Part I\n\nHow efficiently can you pack objects into a minimum number of boxes? How well can you cluster nodes so as to cheaply separate a network into components around a few centers? These are examples of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. \n\nThis course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem. The course content and in particular the homework is of a theoretical nature without any programming assignments.  \n\nThis is the first of a two-part course on Approximation Algorithms.",

    "description": "For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement is good engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, if you would like to take this course for credit at the University of Illinois, apply here: http://education.illinois.edu/online-offcampus/programs-degrees/ldl-online If you have already taken this course in Coursera, you can prepare a portfolio of work created there and request that this work is taken into account for your University of Illinois course.",

    "description": "People analytics is a data-driven approach to managing people at work. For the first time in history, business leaders can make decisions about their people based on deep analysis of data rather than the traditional methods of personal relationships, decision making based on experience, and risk avoidance. In this brand new course, three of Wharton’s top professors, all pioneers in the field of people analytics, will explore the state-of-the-art techniques used to recruit and retain great people, and demonstrate how these techniques are used at cutting-edge companies. They’ll explain how data and sophisticated analysis is brought to bear on people-related issues, such as recruiting, performance evaluation, leadership, hiring and promotion, job design, compensation, and collaboration. By the end of this course, you’ll understand how and when hard data is used to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development, so that you can position yourself as a strategic partner in your company’s talent management decisions. Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen. This course in People Analytics is designed to help you flourish in your career, too.",

    "description": "Data analysis has replaced data acquisition as the bottleneck to evidence-based decision making --- we are drowning in it.  Extracting knowledge from large, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets requires not only powerful computing resources, but the programming abstractions to use them effectively.  The abstractions that emerged in the last decade blend ideas from parallel databases, distributed systems, and programming languages to create a new class of scalable data analytics platforms that form the foundation for data science at realistic scales.\n\nIn this course, you will learn the landscape of relevant systems, the principles on which they rely, their tradeoffs, and how to evaluate their utility against your requirements. You will learn how practical systems were derived from the frontier of research in computer science and what systems are coming on the horizon.   Cloud computing, SQL and NoSQL databases, MapReduce and the ecosystem it spawned, Spark and its contemporaries, and specialized systems for graphs and arrays will be covered.\n\nYou will also learn the history and context of data science, the skills, challenges, and methodologies the term implies, and how to structure a data science project.  At the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nLearning Goals: \n1. Describe common patterns, challenges, and approaches associated with data science projects, and what makes them different from projects in related fields.\n2. Identify and use the programming models associated with scalable data manipulation, including relational algebra, mapreduce, and other data flow models.\n3. Use database technology adapted for large-scale analytics, including the concepts driving parallel databases, parallel query processing, and in-database analytics\n4. Evaluate key-value stores and NoSQL systems, describe their tradeoffs with comparable systems, the details of important examples in the space, and future trends.\n5. “Think” in MapReduce to effectively write algorithms for systems including Hadoop and Spark.  You will understand their limitations, design details, their relationship to databases, and their associated ecosystem of algorithms, extensions, and languages.\nwrite programs in Spark\n6.

    "description": "With the world's first MOOOOO-C, you will gain a broad and comprehensive understanding of all aspects of dairy management such as genetics, nutrition, reproduction, animal health, farm economics, and sustainability of dairy production systems. There's something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry.\n\nThis is an eight-week course. Each week consists of four to nine video lectures, additional reading materials, and a multiple-choice questions quiz. Estimated study time is between three and five hours per week. Learners have the option to purchase a Course Certificate for 49.00 USD. The certificate can be purchased at any time, but you must verify your identify before taking the course quizzes in order to be eligible. For those who cannot afford the certificate fee, financial aid is available through Coursera.\n\nWhy is producing milk efficiently and sustainably so important? \n\nMilk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse Sponsors\n\nThis course was supported by the generous contributions of Pancosma North America and RP Nutrients, Inc., which provided funding support at a Bronze Level.

Picasso, Ed. PPUR. Des outils de base sont décrits dans les 5 premiers chapitres. Les deux derniers chapitres abordent la question de la résolution numérique d'équations différentielles. Plus précisement, nous allons étudier les chapitres suivants du livre :\n\n    Chapitre 1 : interpolation, comment approcher une fonction par un polynôme?\n    Chapitre 2 : comment approcher des dérivées par des formules de différences finies?\n    Chapitre 3 : comment approcher des intégrales par des formules de quadrature?\n    Chapitres 4,5,6 : comment résoudre des (grands) systèmes linéaires?\n    Chapitre 8 : comment résoudre des équations et systèmes d’équations nonlinéaires?\n    Chapitre 9 : comment approcher la solution d’une équations différentielle (problème à valeur initiale)?\n    Chapitre 10 : comment approcher la solution d’un problème aux limites unidimensionnel par une méthode de différences finies?\n\nUn cours de deux heures est donc remplacé par des \"video lectures\" ainsi que les \"quiz\" correspondant. L'heure d'exercices est remplacée par un \"exercice\" où vous devrez faire des expériences numériques avec un programme matlab ou octave, et démontrer des résultats théoriques \"peer review\". Un questionnaire a choix multiple aura lieu à la fin du cours (30% de la note).\n\nIl faut obtenir 60% de la note pour avoir le “Course Certificate”.\n\nPour les étudiants EPFL, les heures de cours selon l'horaire is-academia sont maintenues. Vous devez visionner les \"video lectures\" de la semaine et faire les \"quiz\" avant l'heure de cours. Lors de la première heure de cours, je résoudrai l'exercice théorique (cet exercice theorique sera proposé comme \"peer review\" pour les étudiants externes). Une question du même type pourrait être posée lors de l'examen de juin. Lors de la deuxième heure de cours, je répondrai aux questions et je vous aiderai à faire l'\"exercice\" si nécessaire.\n\nLe temps de travail estimé est le suivant. Il faut compter deux heures pour visualiser les \"video lectures\" et répondre aux \"quiz\". Il faut compter une heure pour faire l'\"exercice\", qui demande de compléter un programme matlab (ou octave) et une heure pour faire l'exercice théorique \"peer review\" soit cinq heures en tout. Après ces cinq heures, vous devriez avoir acquis la matière.",

We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will \"zoom out\" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are \"fragile\" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.",

    "description": "Popularized by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind\", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents.  Over four weeks of lectures, this advanced course considers how to design interactions between agents in order to achieve good social outcomes. Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\n\nIn the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.\n\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-II-Syllabus.html \n\nThere is also a predecessor course to this one, for those who want to learn or remind themselves of the basic concepts of game theory: https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1  \n\nAn intro video can be found here:   http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Game-Theory-2-Intro.mp4",

Maybe you have heard about web services being all the rage, but thought they were too complicated to integrate into your web application. Or maybe you wondered how deploying web applications to the cloud works, but there was too much to set up just to get going.\n \nIn this course, we will explore how to build web applications with the Ruby on Rails web application framework, which is geared towards rapid prototyping.  Yes, that means building quickly! At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to build a meaningful web application and deploy it to the “cloud” using a Heroku PaaS (Platform as a Service). Best of all, it will almost feel effortless… Really!\n \n“But wait”, you will say, “there is no way that we can build a useful application if there is no database involved. You need the data for an application to be useful.” Great point! But what if… instead of getting the data from the database, we get it from the internet by tapping into one of the web services out there that readily provides data needed by our application? “Ok, but that’s probably very complicated”, you will say. Take this course and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how easy it is!",

We start by demonstrating why using debt has always been and continues to be a great temptation, particularly when borrowing costs are historically low. We identify conditions for selecting the optimal amount of debt for a corporation looking to maximize its value.  You’ll become fluent in related concepts like norms and benchmarks. You will explore these and other factors that influence debt for individuals and for public sector organizations -including governments, who are the largest consumers of debt. Like pollution, debt creates systemic risks even for the people and organizations that don’t create it. This course discusses the imperative of limiting and reducing debt and the costs to all of us if we don’t. We build on case based learning giving you opportunities  to interpret, uncover and acquire financial information that is often hidden or missing. We also summarize important threads from previous courses to give you a deep and cohesive understanding of when debt works for you and when it becomes your worst enemy.",

    "description": "This course will examine the music industry in the United States, with the unique perspective gained by Vanderbilt University’s location in Nashville, TN.  Nashville is a major center of music in the United States, and the music created here has a global reach, particularly in the country, rock, pop, singer-songwriter, and Americana genres.  However, students will learn that the basic principles of recording, marketing, copyright, licensing, and live performance are the same, regardless of musical style or genre.\n\nThe music business is one of the most rapidly changing industries in the US today.  It is also an industry filled with contradiction, and media headlines and anecdotal stories often add to the confusion.  Here are just a few statements paraphrased from recent news stories: \n\n* The music business has collapsed\n* Demand for music is expanding at the greatest rate in history\n* Historic recording studios are closing at an alarming rate\n* More people are making recordings than ever before\n* Musicians usually lose money touring\n* Musicians usually make money touring\n* Major artist pulls songs off streaming services because they don’t pay fairly\n* Major artist makes a fortune from streaming services\n* People won’t buy records anymore\n* Vinyl record sales are soaring\n\nThis course will attempt to make sense of these seemingly contradictory trends and data, outline the basic structure and mechanisms of today’s music industry, and encourage students to think critically and entrepreneurially about the future of music.  Leaders from various areas of the music business will lend their perspectives through in-depth interviews, and footage from a recording session will give learners a behind the scenes look at how a song goes from the spark of an idea hummed into a cell phone to a finished recording.\n\nParticipants will grapple with questions about art and commerce which are both timeless and crucially important today, and will emerge from this course with tools allowing them to make more informed decisions as creators, promoters, and consumers of music.\n\nCourse launches February 19, 2016.",

    "description": "Learn the basic concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music.\n\nIf you have a passion for music and are curious about how it works, or if you are a musician who learned to play by ear without formal study, this course will provide you with an engaging introduction to key concepts and approaches needed to understand, create, and perform contemporary music. Taught by Berklee College of Music professor George W. Russell, Jr., the course includes six lessons that delve into harmony and ear training—two areas of intensive focus for every entering Berklee student. \n\nThe course will teach you the major scale and minor pentatonic scale, and how they are constructed. You will learn what intervals are, how to sing them, and how to find them in music. The course explores tonal centers and how to find the key a song is in, in addition to common time signatures such as 4/4 and 3/4. You will learn how to build chords—major and minor triads, and major and dominant seventh chords—and how to build a common chord progression—the I IV V. You will also learn how to recognize the blues and AABA song forms, and write a basic chord sheet to express your song ideas. \n\nIn addition to the video lectures, each lesson features Berklee student performances and interviews. The students share their musical journey and offer advice for those wanting to study music. The course culminates with an assignment that asks you to compose and perform a riff blues tune using the minor pentatonic scale. Above all, the course is designed to share the joy of creating music and sharing it with others.\n\nShannon Jacob will be your Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course. A recent graduate of Berklee, Shannon majored in Contemporary Writing and Production. Hailing from the island of Sri Lanka where she was the Director of Music.inc; a non profit show choir that granted the wishes of terminally ill children. She is a firm believer that music can be used as a powerful tool to educate and inspire those around her.",

Two (2) senior-level executives from leading organizations will provide detailed descriptions of ongoing leadership challenges that they are currently facing within their organizations. The challenges will be real and current. You will be asked to help the executives think through how best to approach and address their respective leadership challenges. Specifically, you will be tasked with drafting a memo to one of the executives outlining your recommendations for how best to address the leadership challenge. To offer effective advice and counsel, you will need to use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the fundamental issue(s), and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations. The memos will be evaluated based on how effectively you apply course concepts to diagnose the problem and how well you link your proposed solutions to the diagnosis. The best submissions will be sent to the executives for their review, and each executive will offer feedback that will then be shared with the entire class to advance everyone’s learning.\n\nThe second option is to identify your own leadership challenge (e.g., at work, at school, in your local community). You should be directly involved in the challenge, and the challenge must align with at least one topic from the specialization. You will develop a presentation where you use course concepts and frameworks to (a) diagnose the core leadership challenge and barriers to effective performance, and then (b) develop a coherent set of solutions or recommendations for your own leadership challenge.\n \nThe third option asks you to interview an executive of your choosing. In this interview, you will ask questions about the challenges faced by that executive with respect to leading people and teams, as well as the practices used by the executive to address his or her challenges. In your written submission, you will use course concepts to organize the major leadership challenges faced by the executive, highlight the strategies and practices used by the executive to address the core leadership challenges, and then to evaluate the effectiveness of the executive’s practices related to leading people and teams.",

We will work through fair use issues for each multimedia format, look at format-specific exceptions in the law, and consider unique issues for seeking permission for film, music, images and data.\n\nAt the end of this course, participants will have a deeper understanding of how to apply our framework for making copyright decisions, and will be more comfortable with assessing multimedia issues.  They will have gained more and more diverse experience for considering fair use.",

We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own!\n\nIn this capstone, you will show off your problem solving and Java programming skills by creating recommender systems. You will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. You will write a program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:\n\n 1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;\n 2. Calculate average ratings;\n 3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and\n 4. Make movie recommendations for a type of movie or for a given user based on ratings.",

    "description": "With its walls razed to ground by Babylon’s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities—from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  \n \nWorking through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.",

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current global challenges in conservation and development, including changes in both sectors.  This course will inspire you to rethink assumptions to address global challenges in conservation and development, and introduce you to new models and approaches that harness technological, behavioral, and financial innovation. This course will equip you with the insights, skills and approaches necessary to successfully overcome these obstacles.  In addition, this course will provide participants with the tools, models, and approaches to address global grand challenges in conservation and development, to question fundamental assumptions, and to create and execute new solutions. Course participants will be trained in the processes around innovation and design to address global grand challenges.  This includes content focused on constructing innovation pipelines, principals of design and engineering unique to the developing world and to conservation (Design for the Other 90%), on harnessing and developing disruptive technologies, principles of behavior and marketing, and on overcoming the challenges with setting up social ventures.\n\nThe course format will facilitate the development of a global community of innovators who will help solve the current and future grand challenges our planet faces in conservation and development, and will encourage thinking about how to do so that rethinks traditional assumptions and approaches within both conservation and development.  This course will leverage the incredible idealism and interest in social entrepreneurship, design, and innovation among the millennials, in the US and abroad, and is intended to appeal to those interested in the maker movement.   It also seeks to engage individuals in the developing world who are closest to the problems of conservation and development,  who would benefit from the approaches taught in the course, and who can leverage their own knowledge of local culture.",

Materials will be presented by the instructors and guest faculty from PennDesign through a series of five or more lessons per module, each typically 10-12 minutes long.   \n\nThe first lesson in each module will be a roundtable discussion among professors Stefan Al, Jonathan Barnett, and Gary Hack introducing the big issues associated with the subject.  Each succeeding module will be a self-contained illustrated presentation of a set of ideas and images. There will be a list of suggested readings for those who wish to follow up on the ideas in each module.\n\nEveryone enrolled in Designing Cities will be expected to complete 3 assignments.  These will be posted on the course site and they will be in the form of peer assessments.  There will be a great deal to be learned from the ideas participants submit, reflecting cities of all sizes and circumstances across the globe so once you submit your assignment, you'll be able to see what your peers have done.",

    "description": "Throughout the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization, we’ve discussed many topics for improving coaching conversations with our employees. It is now time to put all of that theory and discussion into practice and examine great examples of common coaching conversations!\n\nNote: This course builds on all previous courses in the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization. It is highly recommended that students complete or be familiar with the topics covered in those courses before taking this course. In particular, you should be familiar with the coaching strategies and tools discussed in previous courses (such as the 5 whys technique, resisting what is, among others), and should have a full understanding of the Thought model and the various components of it: circumstances, thoughts, feelings, actions, and results.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to demonstrate appropriate and effective strategies when engaging in coaching conversations with those that you lead. By exploring and analyzing common coaching scenarios that are acted out in this course, you will have a great sense of what works well and not so well during such a conversation. Specifically, you'll be able to better differentiate between a developmental coaching approach and a directive management style, discuss new strategies and techniques for dealing with both mind set and skill set gaps, describe how to use the feedback loop effectively in a conversation, and demonstrate the use of good questioning techniques and the thought model to not only help an employee identify issues, but help the employee really change their thinking.\n\nThe final assignment is all about actually having a coaching conversation with another person where you can apply everything you've learned in this course and throughout the Coaching Skills for Managers specialization. Again, it is highly recommended students complete the other courses in the specialization before taking this one. This peer review assignment, in particular, will be difficult to complete without knowledge of the topics covered in these courses.\n\nAfter going through the course materials and completing the assessments, you will be able to have more effective one-on one-coaching meetings with those you manage and deepen your understanding of the essential practice of coaching conversations.",

    "description": "Le cours expose la théorie de Galois, du classique critère de non-résolubilité des équations polynomiales aux méthodes plus avancées de calcul de groupes de Galois par réduction modulo un nombre premier.\n\nLe thème général de cette théorie est l'étude des racines d'un polynôme et concerne en particulier la possibilité de les exprimer à partir des coefficients de ce polynôme. Evariste Galois considère les symétries de ces racines et associe ainsi à ce polynôme un groupe de permutations de ses racines, que l'on appelle maintenant son groupe de Galois. Il dégage à cette occasion pour la première fois, dans ce cadre, la notion de groupe, maintenant omniprésente en mathématiques. Son étude lui permet d'expliquer pourquoi les racines d'une équation prise au hasard ne s'expriment en général pas par des formules algébriques faisant intervenir ses coefficients à partir du degré 5, un résultat démontré auparavant par Abel. Plus généralement, l'étude du groupe de Galois du polynôme permet de dire exactement quand une telle formule existe. C'est ce que l'on appelle la correspondance de Galois : elle relie d'une part la théorie des corps, d'autre part la théorie des groupes.Ce cours expliquera cette théorie en n'utilisant que des résultats de base d'algèbre linéaire. Nous étudierons d'un côté la théorie des corps, c'est-à-dire la façon dont les corps s'emboîtent les uns dans les autres, en introduisant la notion de nombre algébrique (essentiellement les racines de polynômes). D'un autre côté, nous introduirons les éléments nécessaires à l'étude des groupes de permutations. Cela nous permettra d'expliquer la théorie de Galois, non seulement dans son cadre d'origine, c'est-à-dire quand les coefficients du polynôme sont des nombres entiers, mais aussi dans un cadre plus général, par exemple lorsqu'on réduit ces coefficients modulo un nombre premier p.\n\nLe cours culminera avec une comparaison des groupes de Galois dans ces deux situations (« entière » et après réduction modulo p), fournissant ainsi un outil de calcul puissant de ces groupes.\n\nCe cours est l'occasion d'aborder des notions d'algèbre variées, essentielles dans de nombreux domaines des mathématiques, de manière très simple pour très rapidement aboutir à des résultats tout à fait remarquables. Nous n'avons pas cherché la généralité maximale mais au contraire à aller rapidement à l'essentiel en utilisant le minimum de formalisme abstrait. Le FLOTeur intéressé sera alors armé pour aller plus loin, notamment grâce à la bibliographie ou à des cours plus avancés.",

Words and pictures—the building blocks of graphic design—are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.\n\nThrough visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of graphic design: imagemaking, typography, composition, working with color and shape... foundational skills that are common in all areas of graphic design practice. I don't just want you to watch a video of someone talking about design, I want you to MAKE design! If you want to be a designer you have to be a maker, a communicator, so this course will offer you lots of opportunities to get your hands dirty with exercises and with more practical projects.\n\nAt the end of this course you will have learned how to explore and investigate visual representation through a range of image-making techniques; have understand basic principles of working with shape, color and pattern; been exposed to the language and skills of typography; and understand and have applied the principles of composition and visual contrast. If you complete the course, along with its optional (but highly recommended) briefs, you will have a core set of graphic design skills that you can apply to your own projects, or to more deeply investigate a specialized area of graphic design.\n\nTo succeed in this course you will need access to a computer. You can complete this course without one but it will be tougher. Access to, and a beginner's level knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite programs, such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign will help you, especially if you want to complete the optional briefs.",

    "description": "Important note: The second assignment in this course covers the topic of Graph Analysis in the Cloud, in which you will use Elastic MapReduce and the Pig language to perform graph analysis over a moderately large dataset, about 600GB. In order to complete this assignment, you will need to make use of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon has generously offered to provide up to $50 in free AWS credit to each learner in this course to allow you to complete the assignment. Further details regarding the process of receiving this credit are available in the welcome message for the course, as well as in the assignment itself. Please note that Amazon, University of Washington, and Coursera cannot reimburse you for any charges if you exhaust your credit.\n\nWhile we believe that this assignment contributes an excellent learning experience in this course, we understand that some learners may be unable or unwilling to use AWS. We are unable to issue Course Certificates for learners who do not complete the assignment that requires use of AWS. As such, you should not pay for a Course Certificate in Communicating Data Results if you are unable or unwilling to use AWS, as you will not be able to successfully complete the course without doing so.\n\nMaking predictions is not enough!  Effective data scientists know how to explain and interpret their results, and communicate findings accurately to stakeholders to inform business decisions.  Visualization is the field of research in computer science that studies effective communication of quantitative results by linking perception, cognition, and algorithms to exploit the enormous bandwidth of the human visual cortex.  In this course you will learn to recognize, design, and use effective visualizations.\n\nJust because you can make a prediction and convince others to act on it doesn’t mean you should.  In this course you will explore the ethical considerations around big data and how these considerations are beginning to influence policy and practice.   You will learn the foundational limitations of using technology to protect privacy and the codes of conduct emerging to guide the behavior of data scientists.  You will also learn the importance of reproducibility in data science and how the commercial cloud can help support reproducible research even for experiments involving massive datasets, complex computational infrastructures, or both.\n\nLearning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:\n1. Design and critique visualizations\n2. Explain the state-of-the-art in privacy, ethics, governance around big data and data science\n3. Use cloud computing to analyze large datasets in a reproducible way.",

Our main goal is to understand the basic ideas behind the key concepts in game theory, such as equilibrium, rationality, and cooperation. The course uses very little mathematics, and it is ideal for those who are looking for a conceptual introduction to game theory.\n\nBusiness competition, political campaigns, the struggle for existence by animals and plants, and so on, can all be regarded as a kind of “game,” in which individuals try to do their best against others. Game theory provides a general framework to describe and analyze how individuals behave in such “strategic” situations.\n\nThis course focuses on the key concepts in game theory, and attempts to outline the informal basic ideas that are often hidden behind mathematical definitions. Game theory has been applied to a number of disciplines, including economics, political science, psychology, sociology, biology, and computer science. Therefore, a warm welcome is extended to audiences from all fields who are interested in what game theory is all about.",

    "description": "Este proyecto final del Programa Especializado en Desarrollo y Diseño de Videojuegos te permite desarrollar durante 8 semanas un juego completo, entretenido y con visión de mercado, con base en lo que has aprendido en los demás cursos. Para la edición de Julio de 2016 contamos con el apoyo de Samsung de Colombia, Teravision Games y 12 Hit Combo Studios, como describimos más adelante.\n\nDurante 8 semanas definiremos el documento de diseño del videojuego, haremos la planeación y seguimiento según los conceptos de desarrollo ágil adquiridos, definiremos la estrategia de mercadeo y el público objetivo, desarrollaremos iterativamente dos versiones de nuestro juego y utilizaremos información de seguimiento de jugadores para ajustar nuestro juego. Al final produciremos un trailer corto de nuestro prototipo y un pitch corto, los cuales te permitirán mostrarlo fácilmente a posibles inversionistas o personas interesadas.\n\nSamsung Colombia está interesada en que desarrolles este juego para su plataforma Gear VR. Puedes usar el material adicional que agregamos en el curso para guiarte a este respecto. Al final, cuéntanos en la entrega final si deseas mostrar tu juego a Samsung. Escogeremos en cada curso del 2016 un juego, el cual se hará acreedor a un Samsung Galaxy S6 con su Gear VR (ten en cuenta que tenemos pendientes los detalles de envío).\n\nTeravision Games y 12 Hit Combo están interesados en ofrecer internships a estudiantes destacados que terminen este certificado. Vamos a compartir con ellos tus trailers y entregas finales, y estamos ideando con ellos las formas en las cuales puedas participar desde tu ciudad de origen. Ten en cuenta que un internship es generalmente una posición sin pago, que busca que logres una experiencia en un equipo profesional de desarrollo, y que dependiendo de tu desempeño y las posibilidades de la empresa puede llevar a una oferta de trabajo.\n\n¡Suerte y que te diviertas!",

    "description": "This course is the last course of the a Specialization on Leadership called “Inspirational Leadership: Leading with Sense”, so you may want to take the courses “Building Your Leadership Skills” and “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” prior of taking this course.\n\nIn this course you’ll get the opportunity to apply the skills learned in the first two courses of the “Inspirational Leadership: Leading with Sense” as an individual to a group setting. The group could not only be an organization such as a company or a team in a company, but also a private group such as your family or an association. \n\nSpecifically, you’ll apply the 4 steps of The Savoir-Relier protocol to your group: \n1. defining the group identity by working on the group self-awareness, \n2. creating quality relationships within the group, \n3. working on resilience for the group to then be able to overcome difficult situation and \n4. Making the organization grow by creating sense and meaning.\n\nSo if you want your group to grow as a successful leader in its fields, if you want to find your identity as a group and create shared values for it, or if you want your group to become more resilient in face of change and crisis, this course is made for you! Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts. You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.",

The aim is to help learners apply what they have learned during the 16 weeks of the 5 courses and conduct an \"action learning\" project that will consist of the following:\n\n1. Vision Strategy and Action for Co. X\n2. Cross Country Analysis of Co. X when expanding into target new country.\n3. Market or Sector-Specific (B2B Marketing, Healthcare, Hospitality, Entertainment, Sports) Analysis for Co. X\n4. Cross Industry Innovation (new product development) of Co. X when sourcing ideas or expanding into another industry.\n\nAll of these analyses will have templates that will be explained in the video lectures. Each learner will be required to choose a company on which these analyses will be performed. As such, the intent will be to provide an integrated set of insights and application to a chosen managerial situation and problems at hand in the context of a specific region or country. Each learner will be required to also choose another industry (from the ones covered in the Specialization) when performing their Cross Industry Innovation. For example, a learner who has conducted an analysis for a company in the Healthcare industry can conduct a Cross Industry Innovation project using concepts from the Entertainment industry.",

    "description": "Appreciative Inquiry is a collaborative and constructive inquiry process that searches for everything that gives life to organizations, communities, and larger human systems when they are most alive, effective, creative and healthy in their interconnected ecology of relationships. To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life's journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.",

By offering more complex understandings of issues related to professional women and work, the course will help you increase self-knowledge about your own values and vision, as well as enhance your capabilities as a leader, manager, and team contributor. We will examine the opportunities, challenges, trade-offs, and organizational dynamics experienced by women in work organizations, as well as reflect on and practice effective individual behaviors.\n\nThe course aims at answering questions such as: What are the valued attributes and behaviors of women in the workplace? How does the gendered nature of organizations impact women? What derails our career advancement and what propels us upward? What are your leadership goals and aspirations? How can you best integrate your multiple family and work life commitments? How do you define career success? What can organizations do to provide women with opportunities to excel? What opportunities could our global economy harness by advancing women to leadership? How can the full talents of the workforce be tapped into and developed?\n\nThe course is about leadership and inspiring change, but at its core it is meant to inspire and empower women and men across the world to engage in purposeful career development and take on leadership for important causes, to lead change with more conviction and confidence, and improve our workplaces and communities for all. Your involvement in the course activities is essential to help you learn these concepts and develop the necessary skills to implement them. If you watch the videos and read the required articles you will be introduced to some intriguing ideas. If you do the personal reflective exercises and complete the final project you will convert those ideas into relevant experiences to enhance your life and work. Going beyond your personal relevance, your potential learning will expand to understanding and working with others more effectively through either the Discussion Forums in the course or through face-to-face discussions (some of you are taking the course in groups). Each week, we will post reminders, changes, and other relevant announcements.",

The Arch of Titus  commemorates the destruction of Jerusalem by the emperor Titus in 70 CE, an event of pivotal importance for the history of the Roman Empire, of Judaism, of Christianity and of modern nationalism.  \n\nTogether with your guide, Professor Steven Fine, you will examine ancient texts and artifacts, gaining skills as a historian as you explore the continuing significance of the Arch of Titus from antiquity to the very present.   Course members will accompany Professor Fine on virtual \"fieldtrips\" to museums and historical sites in Los Angeles and New York where you will \"meet\" curators, scholars and artists.  You will attend an academic colloquium and even \"participate\" in office hours.  Students will participate in the latest advancement in the study of the Arch - the restoration of its original colors.  You will learn how color was used in Roman antiquity and apply that knowledge to complete your own 'color restoration' of the Arch of Titus menorah relief.",

    "description": "Welcome to the capstone project course in the Coursera Inspirational Leadership Specialization! \nIn the next 6 weeks you'll apply the skills you learned in the Specialization to tackle a real world leadership challenge. \nTo better meet your own goals of taking this Specialization, we provide two options for the capstone project: \n1) Personal leadership challenge; \n2) Cooperate leadership challenges. \nYou'll select one project to implement and will receive assessments from your Capstone peers. No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the corporate challenge, the CEO will introduce it as:\n“In this capstone, you will have to analyze a situation our company is experiencing today and prepare recommendations to our executive committee explaining how to implement the best possible solution to our leadership challenge.”  \n\nThe challenge to be addressed will touch upon the capacity for an organization to grow while keeping its sense of purpose. WIth Poilâne, the original sense of the company is anchored in the values of making the same quality bread for all. When increasing in size and outreach, how can Apollonia and her team maintain the same strong values across places and people? With Bla Bla Car, the fast pace growth of the company raises the same questions around identity. You will find more details as the Capstone unfolds.\nYou can also choose to work on your own organization challenge.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhether you choose the corporate challenge or corporate challenge, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by the company or by yourself, the capacity for the stakeholders to address the issues. You will make recommendations as if you were at the head of the company or the problem.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the company or personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes. Finally, with a view to build sense out of the challenge you will come up with recommendations arguing for a preferred scenario that respects the values and principles of the organization after the change.\nYou will prepare a 10’ presentation for your recommendations to be delivered to the CEO of the company or owner of the challenge.",

    "description": "Medical Neuroscience explores the functional organization and neurophysiology of the human central nervous system, while providing a neurobiological framework for understanding human behavior. In this course, you will discover the organization of the neural systems in the brain and spinal cord that mediate sensation, motivate bodily action, and integrate sensorimotor signals with memory, emotion and related faculties of cognition. The overall goal of this course is to provide the foundation for understanding the impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany injury, disease or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.",

While this course has been developed with North American culture in mind, we do appreciate that, in other parts of the world, the nature of the factors that influence the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors may vary. Nevertheless,it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/aAMIfl.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 3 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: This week's questions: What factors influence the effectiveness of board meetings? What are the formal procedures and structures within the board that impact its performance? What can a board do to intentionally improve the way it structures itself and runs its decision making meetings? \n\nWeek 2: This week's questions:  What do we mean by board composition and development and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of the board? How do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate, recruit and develop board members?   \n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What do we mean by the \"culture\" of the board and why is it important? How do boards develop and pass along culture? Can board cultures be intentionally changed? What is the role of leadership in shaping board culture? What do effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do?  How can leadership be managed for higher performance?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

    "description": "We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!",

The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity. \n\nThe Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.\n\nIn this course we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.",

Analyses of speech and musical databases are consistent with the idea that the chromatic scale (the set of tones used by humans to create music), consonance and dissonance, worldwide preferences for a few dozen scales from the billions that are possible, and the emotions elicited by music in different cultures all stem from the relative similarity of musical tonalities and the characteristics of voiced (tonal) speech. Like the phenomenology of visual perception, these aspects of auditory perception appear to have arisen from the need to contend with sensory stimuli that are inherently unable to specify their physical sources, leading to the evolution of a common strategy to deal with this fundamental challenge.",

This course will introduce the learner to a remarkable new approach to materials discovery and characterization: high-throughput materials development (HTMD).  \n\nEngineers and scientists working in industry, academic or government will benefit from this course by developing an understanding of how to apply one element of HTMD, high-throughput experimental methods, to real-world materials discovery and characterization problems.  Internationally leading faculty experts will provide a historical perspective on HTMD, describe preparation of ‘library’ samples that cover hundreds or thousands of compositions, explain techniques for characterizing the library to determine the structure and various properties including optical, electronic, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and others.  Case studies in energy, transportation, and biotechnology are provided to illustrate methodologies for metals, ceramics, polymers and composites.\n\nThe Georgia Tech Institute for Materials (IMat) developed this course in order to introduce a broad audience to the essential elements of the Materials Genome Initiative.  Other courses will be offered by Georgia Tech through Coursera to concentrate on integrating (i) high-throughput experimentation with (ii) modeling and simulation and (iii) materials data sciences and informatics.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, learners will be able to \n•\tIdentify key events in the development of High-Throughput Materials Development (HTMD)\n•\tCommunicate the benefits of HTMDwithin your organization.\n•\tExplain what is meant by high throughput methods (both computational and experimental), and their merits for materials discovery/development. \n•\tSummarize the principles and methods of high throughput creation/processing of material libraries (samples that contain 100s to 1000s of smaller samples).\n•\tState the principles and methods for high-throughput characterization of structure.\n•\tState the principles and methods for high throughput property measurements.\n•\tIdentify when high-throughput screening (HTS) will be valuable to a materials discovery effort.\n•\tSelect an appropriate HTS method for a property measurement of interest.\n•\tIdentify companies and organizations working in this field and use this knowledge to select appropriate partners for design and implementation of HTS efforts.\n•\tApply principles of experimental design, library synthesis and screening to solve a materials design challenge.\n•\tConceive complete high-throughput strategies to obtain processing-structure-property (PSP) relationships for materials design and discovery.",

    "description": "Welcome to Course FOUR!   In Modules 1-4 you will cover the final elements of the Specialization necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography, and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics to DSLR and Beyond.  Just think of all the information you have absorbed and put to use in your assignments and quizzes, and the confidence you have gained that you CAN control the camera to make pictures you are proud to share.  \n\nHere in Course Four you will start by gaining knowledge related to content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next you will learn principles, tips, and techniques for using the essential element of Light in Ambient/Natural settings.  \n\nThe flash/strobe unit, whether it is built-in to your camera or an add-on \"hotshoe\" model, will finally be something you, not the camera, controls!  You will prove to yourself that those former mysteries of Controlled Continuous and Strobe lighting will no longer be mysterious, as you apply your knowledge to creation of assignment photographs in various situations.  Sharing those pictures in Peer Review will give you the opportunity to learn from your fellow photographers' solutions to lighting challenges, and to gain insight into your own work and creative approaches too.  \n\nThere is an important word to share about Peer Review assignments for this course.  As photographers who have accomplished the quiz and photography requirements of Courses One through Three, you have the knowledge and capability to create quality photographs at a much higher rate of success, and in a much shorter time, than when you began.  You have also proven that you are a dedicated Learner, someone who has a passion for photography and is willing to put forth the extra effort necessary to accomplish your goals.  This Course is the last before the Capstone Course, in which you will be tasked with creating a project over a 2-month period of dedicated photography.  The Peer Review photography assignments have been structured with both your advanced capabilities and dedication in mind...in other words, they will require both!  Be prepared to allocate more time than you have in previous Courses for the assignments, because they will take more time and because you will really enjoy them!\n\nCourse Four ends with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  The pleasures and perils of sharing in social media sites are also yours to discover.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is  important knowledge to have in preparation for the Capstone too!  Let's get started with Module One!",

    "description": "What is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?\n\nEven within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. \n\nAll political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists such as Elizabeth Anderson, Isaiah Berlin, Thomas Christiano, Frantz Fanon, Amy Gutmann, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere, Ayn Rand, John Rawls, Peter Singer, and Kok-Chor Tan. \n\nThe aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree.",

    "description": "This course provides an introduction to systems thinking and systems models in public health. Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed or predicted with traditional statistical methods. Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change. Systems thinking and systems models devise strategies to account for real world complexities.\n\n\nThis work was coordinated by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, the World Health Organization, with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada. Additional support was provided by the Department for International Development (DFID) through a grant (PO5467) to Future Health Systems research consortium.\n\n© World Health Organization 2014\nAll rights reserved.

Documentary evidence shows that Jews started to live in China no later than the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived? Where are they now? The story of Jews in modern China is certainly a fascinating and up-lifting one. This course will examine these questions and more.",

This course introduces you to linguistics, featuring interviews with well-known linguists and with speakers of many different languages. Join us to explore the miracles of human language!\n\nThe Miracles of Human Language introduces you to the many-faceted study of languages, which has amazed humans since the beginning of history. Together with speakers of many other languages around the world, as well as with famous linguists such as Noam Chomsky and Adele Goldberg, you will learn to understand and analyse how your native tongue is at the same time similar and different from many other languages. You will learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.\n\nThis course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics. With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages, as well as on a single language’s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human mind is very welcome to join.\n\nThe course is useful if you want to get a fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course will help you develop analytical skills.\n\nIf you are curious to understand how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course is definitely for you!",

Moreover they come in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and beyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.  We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools – from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.  In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.",

    "description": "Throughout history, the vast majority of people around the globe have believed they have, however defined, a “soul.” While the question of whether the soul exists cannot be answered by science, what we can study are the causes and consequences of various beliefs about the soul and its prospects of surviving the death of the body. Why are soul and afterlife beliefs so common in human history? Are there adaptive advantages to assuming souls exist?  Are there brain structures that have been shaped by environmental pressures that provide the foundation of body/mind dualism that is such a prominent feature of many religions? How do these beliefs shape the worldviews of different cultures and our collective lives? What is the role of competing afterlife beliefs in religion, science, politics, and war? This course explores several facets of this relatively unexplored but profoundly important aspect of human thought and behavior.\n\nThe course consists mainly of 70 to 80 minute lectures, typically broken up into 3 segments, recorded from a course offered by Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences.  These videos include slides and some embedded video clips.  Most lectures are accompanied by slides used during the lecture, also including recommended reading assignment which may provide additional opportunities to reflect on your studies.\n\nDue to the lengthiness of this class and natural progression, the online course has been separated into 3 units, this is Unit 3.",

    "description": "ModPo is a fast-paced introduction to modern and contemporary U.S. poetry, with an emphasis on experimental verse, from Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman to the present. Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly \"difficult.\" We encounter and discuss the poems one at a time. It's much easier than it seems! Join us and try it!\n\nThe next live, interactive 10-week session of ModPo will begin on September 10, 2016, and will conclude on November 21, 2016. Al Filreis will be in touch with you by email before the September 10 start of the course with all the information you'll need to participate. \n\nDuring the 10 weeks of the course, you will be guided through poems, video discussions of each poem, and community discussions of each poem. And (unique among open online courses) we offer weekly, interactive live webcasts. Our famed TAs also offer office hours throughout the week. We help arrange meet-ups and in-site study groups. \n\nIf you are curious about the ModPo team, type \"ModPo YouTube introduction\" into Google or your favorite search engine, and watch the 20-minute introductory video. You will get an overview of the course and will meet the brilliant TAs, who will be encountering the poems with you all the way to the end.\n\nIf you use Facebook, join the always-thriving ModPo group: from inside Facebook, search for \"Modern & Contemporary American Poetry\" and then request to be added as a member. If you have any questions about ModPo, you can post a question to the FB group and you'll receive an almost instant reply.\n\nWe tweet all year long at @ModPoPenn and you can also find ModPo colleagues using the hashtag #ModPoLive.\n\nModPo is hosted by—and is housed at—the Kelly Writers House at 3805 Locust Walk on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia USA. All ModPo'ers are welcome to visit the Writers House when they are in our area. Our discussions are filmed there. Our live webcasts take place in the famed \"Arts Cafe\" of the House. To find out what's going on at the Writers House any time, just dial 215-746-POEM.",

These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nImagine that a friend denies that modus ponens is a valid form of argument. Can you prove that it is valid without using modus ponens itself and thereby assuming that it is valid? If so, how? If not, what does this show about the validity of modus ponens?\n\nHow can phrases like \"and\", \"or\", \"if\", and \"not\" work as \"truth-functional connectives\"?\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to evaluate deductive arguments for validity. In particular, you will learn new ways of representing the information that is contained in the premises of a deductive argument. Using these new representational devices (devices that we call \"truth tables\" and \"Venn diagrams\"), we will be able to apply rules to determine whether or not a particular deductive argument is valid. \n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 6 and 7 by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\n\nGeneral Overview Help Center\n\nUrbanization is reaching a new peak in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities. Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents). There will be also assignments that consist in participating to discussions related to theoretical models presented in the course based on case studies of your choice, and peer assessments on your contributions.\n\nSyllabus :\n\nWeek #1 : Introduction, definition, urban questions and the use of models\n\nWeek #2 : European cities and the weberian model of integration\n\nWeek #3 : Colonial and post colonial cities\n\nWeek #4 : Industrial cities (and Socialist cities) and Marxist models\n\nWeek #5 : The American metropolis and the Chicago School, \n\nWeek #6 : Post metropolis, fragments and differences\n\nWeek #7 : Global cities and mega cities\n\nWeek #8 : Smart cities and the sociology of science and technology",

    "description": "This course examines macroeconomic performance in the short run and the long run based on the economy’s institutional and policy environment. The first module develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them. It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to take into account when assessing a country’s long-term macroeconomic environment. The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n•\tUnderstand the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n•\tAssess the dynamic effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization, government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting things together. We’ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image’s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and “visual contrasts.” through style, juxtaposition, closure and figures of speech. \n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.",

This two-part course builds on the principles that you learned in our Principles of Computing course and is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of \"Algorithmic Thinking\", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to real-world computational problems.\n\nIn part 1 of this course, we will study the notion of algorithmic efficiency and consider its application to several problems from graph theory.  As the central part of the course, students will implement several important graph algorithms in Python and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.\n\nRecommended Background - Students should be comfortable writing intermediate size  (300+ line) programs in Python and have a basic understanding of searching, sorting, and recursion. Students should also have a solid math background that includes algebra, pre-calculus and a familiarity with the math concepts covered in \"Principles of Computing\".",

After the completion of the course you will be able to solve basic standard problems of this theory.  We assume that you are familiar with the Special Theory of Relativity and Classical Electrodynamics. However, as an aid we have recorded several complementary materials which are supposed to help you understand some of the aspects of the Special Theory of Relativity and Classical Electrodynamics and some of the calculational tools that are used in our course.

    "description": "Todos nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. \n\nCada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  \n•\tQuais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n•\tQue diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n•\tQual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n•\tQuais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n•\tQuais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  \n\nDurante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. \n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is a translated version.

    "description": "Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction\n\nIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! \n\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.\n   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  \n   -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.\n   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.\n   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.\n   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  \n   -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  \n   -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.\n   -Use techniques for handling missing data.\n   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).",

    "description": "Aujourd’hui la gestion de l’eau se trouve confrontée à de nouveaux défis tels que le changement climatique ou les conséquences des activités anthropiques. Les acteurs publics ou privés dans ce domaine doivent développer de nouvelles compétences pour mieux gérer le cycle de l’eau « dans son ensemble ». \n\nPar conséquent, l’objectif de ce MOOC est de comprendre les problèmes touchant à la gouvernance de la ressource en eau. Ce cours définira tout d’abord ce qu’est une ressource et plus particulièrement l’eau, son usage, les activités qui y sont rattachées ainsi que les conflits éventuels. Le cours portera plus en détail sur la gestion de l’eau en analysant les différents types de droits et devoirs qui entrent en jeu tels que le développement d’une réglementation multi-sectorielle et d’une approche de gestion par bassin versant. \n\nA l’issu de ce cours, notre objectif est de vous permettre \n1) d’identifier les principaux enjeux et stratégies de gestion de la ressource en eau ;\n2) d’acquérir des clés de lecture pour comprendre les variables (environnementales, institutionnelles, et politiques) influençant la ressource et nécessitant des ajustements en terme de gestion.\n\nCe cours a été développé par le Pôle Eau de Genève et soutenu financièrement par la Direction du développement et de la coopération suisse (DDC). A côté des chercheurs de l’Université de Genève issus de différentes facultés, des chercheurs d’autres universités et centres de recherche interviendront dans ce cours ainsi que des praticiens confrontés au quotidien à la dimension politique de la gestion de l’eau. \n\nCe MOOC est destiné à toutes personnes intéressées par le secteur de l’eau. Vous n’avez pas besoin de formation préalable pour suivre notre programme. Les réflexions présentées dans ce cours se veulent transposables à différents contextes et échelles d’analyse.\n\nCe cours sera aussi disponible avec des sous-titres anglais (à la fin 2015) sur: https://www.coursera.org/learn/watermanagement",

    "description": "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the current economy, Americans shift jobs every 4-5 years, which translates into 8-10 job transitions, including several career changes, over one’s life time. With competition for jobs on the rise, a person’s continuing employability and career success are increasingly defined by his or her mastery of individual career development and the ability to effectively \"manage oneself\" (P. Drucker). \n\nIn this course, you will learn how to think strategically and professionally about your career self-management. Through this course you'll develop an objective, external view of your marketable skills as a solid foundation for building a strong career brand. In particular, you'll be able to:\n\n-  explain why developing a protean and boundaryless career perspective based on transferable (portable) skills is advantageous for continuing employability and career growth; \n-  design your portable skills portfolio, identify and examine critically important competencies underpinning your transferable skills, and analyze your career self-management competency gaps;\n- increase self-awareness, pinpoint your career goals, and envision your future work self; \n- recognize the central role of self-management for developing transferable, marketable, skills and create a customized self-management information system (Career Development Lab) for ongoing personal development and professional growth;\n- conduct a thorough, competency-based job analysis in your area of interest and examine practices of evidence-based, data-driven competitive employee selection; \n-implement your newly developed skills for crafting effective selection criteria statements and refining your job applications.",

In addition, we will describe how to direct analytic activities within a team and to drive the data analysis process towards coherent and useful results. \n\nThis is a focused course designed to rapidly get you up to speed on the process of data analysis and how it can be managed. Our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without sacrificing any essential content. We've left the technical information aside so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward.\n\nAfter completing this course you will know how to….\n\n1. Describe the basic data analysis iteration\n2. Identify different types of questions and translate them to specific datasets\n3. Describe different types of data pulls\n4. Explore datasets to determine if data are appropriate for a given question\n5. Direct model building efforts in common data analyses\n6. Interpret the results from common data analyses\n7. Integrate statistical findings to form coherent data analysis presentations\n\nCommitment: 1 week of study, 4-6 hours\n\nCourse cover image by fdecomite.

It provides examples of how primary health care has been instrumental in approaching this goal in selected populations and how the principles of primary health care can guide future policies and actions.\n\nTwo of the most inspiring, least understood, and most often derided terms in global health discourse are “Health for All” and “Primary Health Care.” In this course, we will explore these terms in the context of global health, their origins and meanings, the principles upon which they rest, and examples of how these principles have been implemented at both small and large scale. We will also explore some ultra-low-cost approaches to Health for All through primary health care, and the promise that primary health care holds for eventually achieving Health for All.\n\nEach module of this course consists of approximately one hour or lecture, approximately one hour of additional readings or video presentations, and two additional hours devoted to studying for each of the quizzes, writing and evaluating two short peer-review assignments, and participating in the discussion forums.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Open Education Lab.",

How does Netflix decide which movies or TV shows you might want to watch?  What if you are a new user, should Netflix just recommend the most popular movies?  Who might you form a new link with on Facebook or LinkedIn?  These questions are endemic to most service-based industries, and underlie the notion of collaborative filtering and the recommender systems deployed to solve these problems.  In this fourth case study, you will explore these ideas in the context of recommending products based on customer reviews.  \n\nIn this course, you will explore dimensionality reduction techniques for modeling high-dimensional data.  In the case of recommender systems, your data is represented as user-product relationships, with potentially millions of users and hundred of thousands of products.  You will implement matrix factorization and latent factor models for the task of predicting new user-product relationships.  You will also use side information about products and users to improve predictions.\n\nLearning Outcomes:  By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Create a collaborative filtering system.\n   -Reduce dimensionality of data using SVD, PCA, and random projections.\n   -Perform matrix factorization using coordinate descent.\n   -Deploy latent factor models as a recommender system.\n   -Handle the cold start problem using side information.\n   -Examine a product recommendation application.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python.",

You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure, which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to the logic of “acceptable loss”: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.\n\nYou will have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.\n\nThe development trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market, develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding financing.\n\nThe course is made up of methodological sessions as well as first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself represents a significant life decision.\n\nYou will also see that the creation of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual one.\n\nIn the English version, all of the reading content, quizzes and assesments will be in English, whilst the videos will have French audio and English subtitles.",

    "description": "The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly. Please refer to the Resources section to review this course’s activity guides.",

    "description": "The objective of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping. To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.",

    "description": "This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy. Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. \n\nTopics you’ll learn about will include: \n\nEpistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nMoral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.\n\nThe development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.\n\nTo accompany 'Introduction to Philosophy', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Introduction to Philosophy' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind.

We’ll also look at some core algorithms for searching for and sorting data.   And along the way, you will develop an exciting interactive application with a graphical user interface.\n\nIn this course we want you to be inspired to create.  You’ll dive into a course project right away, with each lesson designed around concepts that are directly applicable to extending the project’s functionality.  The video lectures include both core content as well as testimonials and stories from real-world software engineers, conversations between real students who are learning the material that you will likely relate to, and numerous support videos that you can turn to if you get stuck.",

We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability.

While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWhen is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting? What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand Arguments will answer these questions a more. \n\nIn this course, you will learn what an argument is. The definition of argument will enable students to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not. Next, we will learn how to break an argument into its essential parts, how to put them in order to reveal their connections, and how to fill in gaps in an argument. By the end of this course, students will be better able to understand and appreciate arguments that they and other people present.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 1-5, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format:\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.",

Mechanics begins by quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy and momentum. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.\n\nThis on-demand course is recommended for senior high school and university students, science teachers and anyone with a curiosity about basic physics. The course uses rich multimedia tutorials to present the material: film clips of key experiments, animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator. You'll do a range of interesting practice problems, and in an optional component, you will use your ingenuity to complete at-home experiments using simple, everyday materials.\n\nYou will need some simple high-school mathematics: arithmetic, a little algebra, quadratic equations, and the sine, cosine and tangent functions from trigonometry. The course does not use calculus. However, we do provide a study aid introducing the calculus that would accompany this course if it were taught in a university.\n\nBy studying mechanics in this course, you will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology and in the universe at large. Meanwhile, we think you'll have some fun, too.",

    "description": "This is a master course given in Moscow at the Laboratory of Algebraic Geometry of the National Research University Higher School of Economics by Valery Gritsenko, a professor of University Lille 1, France.\nJacobi forms are holomorphic functions in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis. (Ph.D. support might be available at CEMPI in Lille or at the Faculty of Mathematics of National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow)",

    "description": "This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.\n\nFinally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go \"dormant\" within a host for many years before causing an active infection.",

You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.\n\n The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.

    "description": "“It depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S. university admission process.  With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.\n\nThis course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.\n\n* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling – if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university.  Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.",

    "description": "Manipulating big data distributed over a cluster using functional concepts is rampant in industry, and is arguably one of the first widespread industrial uses of functional ideas. This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course, we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for improved performance.\n\nLearning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark,\n- manipulate data with Spark and Scala,\n- express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style, \n- recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark,\n\nRecommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum. I will present evidence behind these startling discoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.\n\nThis course is offered in English.",

    "description": "Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private business and ordinary citizens. And in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability. But what does this exactly mean? What is the nature of this threat? Who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why? What can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us?\n\nThese are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts. First it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it. The second part provides an overview of the state of the art in (counter) terrorism studies. Since ‘9/11’ terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats. But what has academia come up with? What theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it? The most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths. The final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making.\n\nTestimonials of students who completed this course:\n\nI've been studying one particular aspect of the field for about fifteen years now, but lacked the sort of wider context that this course has provided. And I've made contacts here that I hope will develop into friendships.\n-Charles Cameron, 69, Blogger Religious Studies, UK\n\nThis has been a wonderfully enriching experience. I have learned a lot, and have especially appreciated the worldwide perspectives of the class found in the discussion forum. Being in this class has helped me open up the subject to discussion with colleagues and friends, which has led to interesting and insightful conversations. The class materials were effective and polished. The peer reviewed assignments were challenging and fun. This was my first MOOC, but certainly not my last!  \n-Joella Givens, 50, GIS Manager at a state government Department of Transportation, USA\n\nThe theoretical aspect was similar to the one offered by well respected universities for introductory courses on terrorism. For just 5 weeks, I think this course covered a lot of ground. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the discussion forums. (...)In addition, I found excellent recommendations on books, articles, documentaries, all of great quality.\n-Arete Ketekidou, 32, Research/Analyst, Greece\n\nI like very much the freedom we have to study, this is the best incentive, not only because we can express our ideas on forums freely and manage our own time, also because Professor Bakker has not been imposing his ideology on this topic. We receive different information to formulate our own position.\n-Valeria Hernández Reyes, 28, Environmental Engineer, Mexico",

Perhaps, you have even taken Course 1, \"Ruby on Rails: An Introduction\" (we highly recommend it) where you relied on external web services to be your “data layer”. But in the back of your mind, you always knew that there would come a time when you would need to roll up your sleeves and learn SQL to be able to interact with your own relational database (RDBMS). But there is an easier way to get started with SQL using the Active Record Object/Relational (ORM) framework. In this course, we will be able to use the Ruby language and the Active Record ORM framework to automate interactions with the database to quickly build the application we want.\n \nIn Rails with Active Record and Action Pack, we will explore how to interact with relational databases by using Active Record, a Ruby gem, which Rails uses by default for database access. We will then take a look at what role Active Record plays in the overall request-response cycle, when a client (the browser) requests data from the server, as well as how to submit the data to the server.  Of course, when accessing data, security is of paramount importance! We will talk about vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, as well as how to secure access to data by authenticating and authorizing users accessing the data. Take this course to build a Ruby on Rails application with Active Record to automate the detailed SQL interactions with our database.",

    "description": "Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments!\n\nAccording to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n•\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.",

This course is an invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight.

If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.\n\nThe course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.\n\nYou’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.\n\nAssignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\n\nMost important, you’ll have a lot of fun.",

    "description": "Learn about the principles of management of urban infrastructures in the era of Smart Cities. The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has already resulted and will continue to result in numerous challenges and opportunities. This course will help you to make the best out of the introduction of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  \n\nOver the past few years, advancements in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable landscape of urban infrastructure services provision. The result is an increasing interest in the transitioning of cities towards so-called “smart cities”- an interest expressed both by technology vendors and public authorities. Although such “smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and for service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\n\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with “smart urban infrastructures” as well as how these infrastructures can be managed in order to deliver desirable performance in cities. More precisely, throughout this 5-week MOOC you will learn about the most important principles for the management of smart urban infrastructures as well as about the application of these principles to two specific sectors, namely urban transportation and urban energy systems. \n\nThe course does not have any pre-requisits. However, in order to make the best of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our previous MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures which has been widely appraised by learners. \n\nThrough this course, students will:\n- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies that are and can be used for “smart infrastructure” solutions in cities, while effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart systems;\n- Learn about the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n- Understand the potential applications of the materials learned in this course, within the context of the management of “smart urban transportation systems” as well as “smart urban energy systems”.\n\nClass workload: 2 hours / week",

Winning support can be a struggle. As a result, powerful new ideas often get stuck. This is especially true in the cultural sector. People involved in arts and culture often have little time and even less money for experimentation and risks. This course will help those in the performing arts, museums, zoos, libraries and other cultural organizations build environments where new management and program ideas flourish.\n\nLeading Innovation in Arts & Culture will teach you how to make an \"innovation strategy\" a fundamental component of your organization's overall strategy. In this seminar you will learn to:\n\n- Analyze constraints on innovation in your organization, foresee obstacles and opportunities, and develop a shared vision\n- Develop a process to manage the demands of multiple stakeholders, shifting priorities and the uncertainty inherent in new initiatives\n- Create a culture for innovation and risk-taking that generates new perspectives and challenges existing practice\n- Create a strong customer focus within your organization that anticipates customer needs\n\nNational Arts Strategies worked with David Owens to customize this course for those working in the cultural sector.

From a simple email request for your colleague to help you, to developing a presentation for the board of directors, these are acts of communication that require a good degree of persuasion. Even the process of entering the workforce requires effective persuasive communication, for in the act of writing your resume, cover-letter, or in the interview process, you are essentially persuading the potential employer to hire you.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to structure and express your ideas in a convincing and persuasive manner in writing, apply basic principles of persuasive writing to convince different sets of audiences at the globalised workplace, and learn to engage in persuasive and credible communication across different cultures in a complex globalised environment.",

    "description": "This is an Exploratorium teacher professional development course taught by Teacher Institute staff, open to any science teacher (particularly middle or high school level) and science enthusiast. This is a hands-on workshop that explores topics and strategies teachers can use to help their students become active investigators of light.\n\nWatch a preview video (copy and paste this link into your browser): https://youtu.be/fPvT_quBVIw\n\nThere are four weeks of course content, which require 2-4 hours per week. Each module builds upon the previous one, so we strongly suggest you follow the sequence we've outlined rather than skip ahead or do the course in less time. The course is designed to give you an opportunity to learn and share with others, not test what you know. There are weekly activity and reflection assignments, but these will not be graded. To receive credit for this course, you will need to complete the peer-reviewed final assignment.\n\nAs a participant, you will:\n- Watch videos that demonstrate natural phenomena and the Exploratorium's approach to teaching and learning \n- Conduct personal investigations by engaging in hands-on activities based in those phenomena\n- Reflect and share your experience doing activities\n- Discuss and identify challenges and opportunities for teaching\n- Devise a lesson of your own based on one or more of the activities\n\nEach week, we'll look at a different light-related topic: We will start by examining human visual perception, then take a brief historical tour of our evolving scientific understanding. We’ll also look at optics and optical instruments and finish by looking at the wave nature of light. \n\nTo get the most out of this experience, you'll have to try out some activities! In return, you'll get lots of valuable teaching resources, an in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and useful tips and techniques for the classroom.\n\nNOTE: This is a hands-on workshop, so you will need to buy or find materials. All of the materials required are inexpensive and should be easy to obtain, and we welcome substitutions! A separate list of materials is available for each activity.",

    "description": "This course uses the lives, ideals and achievements of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt to create the idea of a Rooseveltian century. It is about doing research, analyzing primary sources, and connecting all this information with a coherent and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically and historically, and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be a historian at work. \n\nWe are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the 3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. \n\nThe structure of the course is straightforward: \n- An introductory module gives you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;\n-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government’s role in providing it; \n- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;\n- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of their central political goals;\n- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our recent past – and our possible futures?\n\nThe five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate your creativity, and research guidance and assignments to sharpen up your historical skills. \n\nWe hope you will enjoy this intellectual journey!",

As the central part of the course, students will implement several algorithms in Python that incorporate these techniques and then use these algorithms to analyze two large real-world data sets.  The main focus of these tasks is to understand interaction between the algorithms and the structure of the data sets being analyzed by these algorithms.\n\nOnce students have completed this class, they will have both the mathematical and programming skills to analyze, design, and program solutions to a wide range of computational problems.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life.

It will provide the basic foundations of international marketing and then explain how companies can grow by going abroad or sourcing ideas/expanding into other countries or industries. This is summarized as CCCI: Cross-Country and Cross-Industry Innovation, a term and analytical platform used throughout not only this course but others in the specialization. As an introductory course, we keep the concepts short and simple in order to ease learners into the wonderful world of international marketing. More specific operational aspects such as managing the product, price, place and promotion as well as targeting and positioning will be provided in the second course of the specialization. \n\nAfter you successfully complete this course learners will obtain the following outcomes:\n\n(1) an understanding of the core meaning of marketing and international marketing. \n(2) learn that international marketing is about striking the right balance between maximizing the similarities across cultures (Etic approach) and customizing marketing (Emic approach) to important local differences.\n(3) learn about how to source or expand into other industries at home or abroad via cross industry innovation.\n(4) obtain a solid foundation for subsequent courses such as course 2 (International Marketing Entry and Execution) and the industry-specific courses in the specialization.",

Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.\n\nA lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.\n\n Los objetivos de este curso son:\n1.\tMostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.\n2.\tTransmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.\n3.\tContribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.\n\n\nPor ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas. También se dirige a estudiantes que se dispongan a iniciar estudios de grado o postgrado en administración pública, gestión pública o análisis de políticas públicas.",

We will focus on fundamental principles like “sharing is hard”, “crowds are wise”, and “network of networks” that have guided the design and sustainability of today’s networks, and summarize the theories behind everything from the social connections we make on platforms like Facebook to the technology upon which these websites run.\n\nUnlike other networking courses, the mathematics included here are no more complicated than adding and multiplying numbers.

    "description": "College can be confusing and intimidating, but U101 can help. If you were just admitted to college and are nervous about what the next step in life might look like, this course is for you. If you are the parent of a newly admitted college student and curious about what college life is like, this course is also for you. \n\nWhile your specific college will, no doubt, provide additional orientation material, we wanted to give some basic information about what life might be like at a large American University. You might be years away from college or enrolled right now; either way, U101 has some excellent advice from college students, professors, administrators, and staff.\n\nAt the conclusion of the course, learners should:\n1. Understand the basics of how colleges and universities operate. \n2. Identify and describe what faculty are looking for in college-level academic work. \n3. List some effective study strategies. \n4. Identify some strategies for exploring and selecting a major. \n5. Identify the various types of grants and scholarships available and describe the steps involved in applying to these.\n6. Discuss the college life, with special attention to the benefits/limitations of living on or off campus. \n7. Identify some strategies for getting the most out of campus life activities (investigating student clubs, fraternities, sororities, etc.).\n\nThe course is divided into 4 weeks/8 lessons, which provide an overview of the different aspects of college life. If you were just watching the videos and looking at some of the links, the whole course would take about 4-5 hours. \n\nWeek 1\nLesson 1. Welcome to U101!\nLesson 2. Understanding the Nature of College\n\nWeek 2\nLesson 3. Succeeding as a Student\nLesson 4. Building Your Major\n\nWeek 3\nLesson 5. Financing Your Education\nLesson 6. Living On and Off Campus\n\nWeek 4\nLesson 7. Getting Involved in Campus Life\nLesson 8. Conclusion\n\nPlease join us for a short exploration of modern American Colleges. Hopefully, this course can help demystify your upcoming college experience.",

This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the \"reference genome\" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and \"map\" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.",

Each module consists of five video lectures with embedded quizzes, followed by an electronically graded homework assignment.  Additionally, modules 1, 3, and 5 also contain a peer assessment. \n \nThe homework assignments will require time to think through and practice the concepts discussed in the lectures. In fact, a significant amount of your learning will happen while completing the homework assignments.

    "description": "Economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of Neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory of human decision-making. \n\nNeuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide. Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials. The course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of  Neuroeconomics. Our students have different backgrounds; therefore, I have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content. This course will help you to start your progress in the field of Neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future. For some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field. Each module provides optional reading material.\n\nThe course structure is as follows: During each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions. Your answers will not affect your final grade. At the end of each module, you must complete a quiz consisting of 15 questions. To pass the course, you must reach a satisfactory standard in all the course modules by completing all graded quizzes and the final exam. In addition to watching video lectures and taking quizzes, you will receive an invitation to join our forum.

Mécanique Lagrangienne\n\nLe formalisme de Lagrange permet une résolution efficace de problèmes complexes de mécanique. Il permet aussi d'apporter un éclairage plus fondamental sur les lois de conservation (théorème de Noether). A titre d'illustration de la méthode de Lagrange, on traitera le problème très important des oscillateurs harmoniques couplés, exprimé comme un problème de valeurs propres et de vecteurs propres. On termine avec un formalisme permettant d'analyser les  résonances paramétriques, notion illustrée par l'expérience montrant la stabilité d'un pendule inversé forcé.",

    "description": "In this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\n•\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\n•\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.  \n•\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets.\n•\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes.\n•\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

The fundamental concepts studied in this course will reappear in many other classes and business settings. Our focus will be on  interpreting the meaning of the results in a business and managerial setting.\n\nWhile you will be introduced to some of the science of what is being taught, the focus will be on applying the methodologies.  This will be accomplished through use of Excel and using data sets from many different disciplines, allowing you to see the use of statistics in very diverse settings. The course will focus not only on explaining these concepts but also understanding the meaning of the results obtained.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tTest for beliefs about a population..\n•\tCompare differences between populations.\n•\tUse linear regression model for prediction. \n•\tLearn how to use Excel for statistical analysis.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and regulations relevant to establishing and managing a company within the European Union, the course also explores business considerations within a broader perspective by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically, the course discusses strategic and financial considerations within Company law, as well as Labour law issues such as restructuring enterprises, working conditions and handling crises situations. The course also examines other legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.\n\nThe course is useful to persons both inside and outside the European Union, whether they are students, professionals, or simply interested in the European Union and/or European Business Law. The series is ideal for entrepreneurs and businessmen/women who plan to work or do business in a European context and want to sharpen their competitiveness. For lawyers it is a great course to take in order to refresh European Union law or to gain an understanding of law in the context of European business. Those preparing for a legal career will also benefit from the course as it gives a good understanding of European Union law while including lectures by some of the most leading academics and practitioners in the field. \n\nPrior knowledge of law and the European Union is an advantage, but not a prerequisite. If you have taken our introductory course on Understanding the EU Fundamentals you might however have a bit of head start.\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nWe are currently working on the third course in the series, and it will be launched in September 2016. To keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work. A module includes a number of lectures and readings, and finishes with an assessment – a quiz or a peer graded assignment. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and ensure that you understand the material of the course. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary. \n\nFAQ\n\n1. Will I get a certificate after completing this class?\nLearners who successfully complete a course in the series will receive a Course Certificate. \n\n2. Do I earn Lund credits upon completion of this class?\nThe certificate is not part of a formal qualification from Lund University. \n\n3. What resources will I need for this class?\nThe learners are not required to purchase a textbook since all readings will be provided online. All reading materials are free and will be available to use for the duration of the course.  \n\n4. What are the learning outcomes of this course and why should I take it?\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to: \n\n•\tNavigate EU legal sources\n•\tUnderstand the relevant regulations governing the internal European Union market \n•\tEstablish and run a company within the European Union \n•\tSet up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n•\tEmploy staff and recognize workers rights and obligations\n•\tComply with tax regulations and environmental standards \n•\tSuccessfully analyse EU case law and draft case reports\n\n5. Can I contact the course instructors directly?\nThe course staff will participate in the discussion forum and welcome questions and comments. We encourage the learners to be active and engaged, interacting with other participants and sharing ideas.   \n\nLund University\n\nLund University was founded in 1668. The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law. The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. \n\nEducation, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.",

    "description": "This course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.",

    "description": "The blues is an American art form and the most important musical form in jazz. Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.",

Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will learn about innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. As an upcoming manager, you will also learn how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this course will explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Today, effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach.

    "description": "What is a musician’s response to the condition of the world? Do musicians have an obligation and an opportunity to serve the needs of the world with their musicianship?\n \nAt a time of crisis for the classical music profession, with a changing commercial landscape, a shrinking audience base, and a contraction in the number of professional orchestras, how does a young musician construct a career today? Are we looking at a dying art form or a moment of reinvigoration?\n \nIn this course we will develop a response to these questions, and we will explore the notion that the classical musician, the artist, is an important public figure with a critical role to play in society.\n \nThe course will include inquiry into a set of ideas in philosophy of aesthetics; a discussion about freedom, civil society, and ways that art can play a role in readying people for democracy; discussion on philosophy of education as it relates to the question of positive social change; and an exploration of musical and artistic initiatives that have been particularly focused on a positive social impact.\n \nGuiding questions for this course inquiry will include:\n \n      - How can classical music effect social change?\n      - How has music made positive change in communities around the globe?\n      - What can the field of classical music learn from other movements for social change?\n      - How have educators and philosophers thought about the arts and their connection to daily contemporary life?\n \nEach class will explore one critical question through lectures, discussions, interviews, or documentaries.",

    "description": "Ders çok değişkenli fonksiyonlardaki iki derslik dizinin ikincisidir. Birinci ders türev ve entegral kavramlarını geliştirmekte ve bu konulardaki problemleri temel çözme yöntemlerini sunmaktadır. Bu ders, birinci derste geliştirilen temeller üzerine daha ileri konuları işlemekte ve daha kapsamlı uygulamalar ve çözümlü örnekler sunmaktadır. Ders gerçek yaşamdan gelen uygulamaları da tanıtmaya önem veren “içerikli yaklaşımla” tasarlanmıştır. \n\nBölümler\nBölüm 1: Multivar 1'in Özeti, Dairesel Koordinatlarda Entegraller\nBölüm 2: Türev Uygulamalarından Seçme Konular\nBölüm 3: Çok Değişkenle Zincirleme Türev ve Jakobiyan\nBölüm 4: Uzayda Yüzey ve Hacım Entegralleri\nBölüm 5: Düzlemde Akı Entegralleri\nBölüm 6: Düzlemde Green, Uzayda Stokes ve Green-Gauss Teoremleri\nBölüm 7: Stokes ve Green-Gauss Teoremleri ve Doğanın Korunum Yasaları\n-----------\nThe course is the second of the two course sequence of calculus of multivariable functions. The first course develops the concepts of derivatives and integrals of functions of several variables, and the basic tools for doing the relevant calculations. This course builds on the foundations of the first course and introduces more advanced topics along with more advanced applications and solved problems. The course is designed with a “content-based” approach, i. e. by solving examples, as many as possible from real life situations.\n\nBölümler\nBölüm 1: Summary of Multivar I, Integral in Circular Coordinates\nBölüm 2: Topics of Derivative Applications\nBölüm 3: Chain Derivatives with Multi Variables and Jacobian\nBölüm 4: Surface and Volume Integrals in Space\nBölüm 5: Flux Integrals in the Plane\nBölüm 6: Green in Plane, Stokes in Space and Green-Gauss Theorems\nBölüm 7:  Stokes and Green-Gauss Theorem and Nature Conservation Laws\n-----------\nKaynak: Attila Aşkar, “Çok değişkenli fonksiyonlarda türev ve entegral”.
