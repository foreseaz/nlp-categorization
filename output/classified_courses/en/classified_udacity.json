We've built this course in partnership with experts such as Kelsey Hightower and Carter Morgan from Google and Netflix’s former Cloud Architect, Adrian Cockcroft (current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures), who provide critical learning throughout the course. \n\nMastering highly resilient and scalable infrastructure management is very important, because the modern expectation is that your favorite sites will be up 24/7, and that they will roll out new features frequently and without disruption of the service. Achieving this requires tools that allow you to ensure speed of development, infrastructure stability and ability to scale. Students with backgrounds in Operations or Development who are interested in managing container based infrastructure with Kubernetes are recommended to enroll!\n\nIn this course you will learn to:\n\n - Containerize an application by creating Docker config files and build processes to produce all the necessary Docker images\n - Configure and launch an auto-scaling, self-healing Kubernetes cluster\n - Use Kubernetes to manage deploying, scaling, and updating your applications\n - Employ best practices for using containers in general, and specifically Kubernetes, when architecting and developing new microservices",

    "description": "At first it may seem strange to consider monetization before a game is even completed, and many developers leave this as an afterthought. But monetization should be built into the fabric of a game from the beginning, because a clearly defined and understood monetization strategy can have tremendous impact on design decisions made during the development process. This kind of forward-thinking approach is especially important in today’s highly competitive game market, and keeping monetization strategy front-of-mind throughout can be the difference between product success and failure. \n\nThis course will teach you how to make your game stand out in a very crowded field, and encourage people to pay for game features that will define the ultimate success of your product.\n\nCurrently, most game apps are free to play, and many users are looking for something simple and entertaining without the risk of making a purchase. We'll look at the most successful premium and freemium games, and discuss the most effective strategies for monetization. Our goal in this course is to teach students how to design games that produce sustainable revenue over the long-term.",

Many startups fail by not validating their ideas early on with real-life customers. In order to mitigate that, students will learn how to get out of the building and search for the real pain points and unmet needs of customers. Only with these can the entrepreneur find a proper solution and establish a suitable business model.\n\nBuilding a startup is not simply building an execution plan for a business model that the entrepreneur thinks will work, but rather, a search for the actual business model itself.",

Learn from Karthik Ramasamy, Technical Lead of Storm@Twitter, about the distributed, fault-tolerant, and flexible technology used to power Twitter’s real-time data flow pipeline.  Twitter open sourced Storm in 2011, and it graduated to a top-level Apache project in September, 2014.  \n\nStarting from basic distributed concepts presented during our first Udacity-Twitter Storm Hackathon, link Storm concepts to Storm syntax to scalably drive Word Cloud visualizations with Vagrant, Ubuntu, Maven, Flask, Redis, and d3.  Link to the public Twitter gardenhose stream to process live tweets, parse embedded URLs, and calculate Top worldwide hashtags.  Extend beyond Storm basics by exploring multi-language capabilities in Python, integrate open source components, and implement real-time streaming joins.\n\nIn your final project, follow real-time trending topics by implementing the data pipeline to visualize only tweets that contain Top worldwide hashtags.  Extend your project by exploring the Twitter API, or any data source, alongside Hackathon participants as they design their own ideas, receive feedback from Karthik, and open source a final project calculating real-time tweet sentiment and geolocation to drive a U.S. Map.",

    "description": "You will learn about challenges of building applications that can serve hundreds of thousands of users, and how you can prepare for them as a developer. And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of **App Engine** - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! \n\nHowever, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using Cloud Endpoints that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.",

    "description": "The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.\n\nThis course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. “Scale” really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you’ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you’ll need to do so.\n\nThe techniques you’ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you’ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models you’ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)",

A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images is undertaken over the entire term. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making will be emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation.\n\nTopics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined. New forms of cameras and imaging paradigms will be introduced.",

We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really classification theory best learned in an ML course.\n\nThe focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what [Yogi Berra](http://yogiberramuseum.org/just-for-fun/yogisms/) said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. (Einstein said something similar but who knows more about real life?)

Pretty cool, no?\n\nYou'll do this by making small (but important) modifications to the source code for the original 2048 game. If this sounds intimidating, don't worry. We'll teach you the basics of HTML and CSS and how they interact with Javascript (don't worry if that sentence doesn't mean anything to you yet. It will soon).\n\nThe purpose of this class is to have fun learning how to quickly and easily take an existing open source program, make some changes, and create something that looks and feels completely new. The game you create will be mobile friendly (you can play it on your phone!) and totally shareable.",
