Flooding. The melting of the polar ice caps. \u00a0\n\nIn this energy and earth science course, you will learn how continental water and ice masses are measured and monitored through remote sensing. You will learn how water and mass transport can be traced, and how this relates to the Earth\u2018s complex system.\n\nWe will also discuss global change and its indicators, and why experts have clear evidence that this change is actually taking place. By the end of this course, you will understand the importance of preserving the planet and observing the Earth\u2019s oceans.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "ChM004x: Sensing Planet Earth \u2013 Water and Ice", "price": 0, "instructors": "Thomas Hobiger, Gisela Carvajal, Leif Eriksson, R\u00fcdiger Haas and Anders Berg", "institution_name": ["Chalmers University of Technology"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/sensing-planet-earth-water-ice-chalmersx-chm004x", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
