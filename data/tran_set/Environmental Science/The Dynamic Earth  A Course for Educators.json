Informed by the recently released Next Generation Science Standards, this course examines geological time scales, radiometric dating, and how scientists \u201cread the rocks.\u201d We will explore dramatic changes in the Earth over the last 4 billion years, including how the evolution of life on Earth has affected its atmosphere. In addition to looking at geology on a global scale, participants will take to their own backyards to explore and share their local geologic history. Course participants will bring their understanding of the dynamic Earth - along with content resources, discussion questions, and assignments - into their own teaching.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction &amp; The Mystery of Geologic TimeYou will explore the ways scientists study the rock record to determine the geologic history of the Earth. Evolution of the AtmosphereYou will learn how the evolution of photosynthetic life changed the concentration of oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere, and how this is reflected in the rock record. You will also become familiar with how the Next Generation Science Standards connect to this week\u2019s content. Finally, you will complete a written assignment: an analysis of a local geologic feature.Plate Tectonics: Mountain BuildingYou will learn how convection causes solid rock to flow in the Earth\u2019s mantle and how the movement of the Earth\u2019s tectonic plates forms mountains. You will also learn how to identify and address common student misconceptions about plate tectonics.\nPlate Tectonics: EarthquakesYou will learn about earthquake risk. Using a multimedia teaching case about earthquake risk in Bangladesh, you will learn how scientists define and assess the risk from geologic events. You will also learn how to implement this or similar teaching cases with your students. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Dynamic Earth: A Course for Educators", "price": 0, "instructors": "Edmond Mathez and Ro Kinzler", "institution_name": ["American Museum of Natural History"], "commitment": "5-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/earth-amnh", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
