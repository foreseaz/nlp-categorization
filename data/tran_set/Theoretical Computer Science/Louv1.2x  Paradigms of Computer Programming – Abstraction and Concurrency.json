We cover the three main programming paradigms: functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.\n\nThe two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\n\nLouv1.1x\u00a0(Fundamentals) covers\u00a0functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You\u2019ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.\n\nLouv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency)\u00a0covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You\u2019ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You\u2019ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.\n\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the two courses,\u00a0watch the introductory video.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-01-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Louv1.2x: Paradigms of Computer Programming \u2013 Abstraction and Concurrency", "price": 0, "instructors": "Peter Van Roy", "institution_name": ["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/paradigms-computer-programming-louvainx-louv1-2x-1", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
