We\u2019ll address the important questions about Bitcoin, such as:How does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future hold?After this course, you\u2019ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You\u2019ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you\u2019ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.Course Lecturers:Arvind Narayanan, Princeton University\u00a0Joseph Bonneau, Princeton University\u00a0Edward Felten, Princeton University\u00a0Andrew Miller, University of MarylandSupplementary materials:For the textbook, see below under Suggested Readings.
