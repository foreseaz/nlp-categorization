The projects must be interdisciplinary, meaning integrated learning must occur across several content areas. The STEM project must appeal to girls and boys from every background,and promote STEM related clubs within the school (i.e. STEM trendy). The project requires collaboration utilizing a blog, twitter, a web page, YouTube, Google Docs, One Drive, a Flickr photo site, Prezi presentations, and most importantly a Microsoft Project file. All of the STEM projects should show a linkage between education and industry sectors. Teachers are required to connect project activities to the four STEM domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics relative to your grade level. The Science and Engineering Practices (SEPS) guides are a major input for planning your projects.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introductions and Creating the STEMtrend project file Module 2: Planning Project STEMtrends Module 3: Designing Project STEMtrends Module 4: Developing Project STEMtrends Module 5: Implementing and Supporting Project STEMtrends\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "Engineering a STEM Trend in a Middle School", "price": 0, "instructors": "Felicia Collins", "institution_name": ["Richland County School District One"], "commitment": "1-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/richlandcounty/courses/engineering-stem-trend", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
