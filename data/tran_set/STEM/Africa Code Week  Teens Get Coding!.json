It\u2019s in many of our household appliances and is used to manufacture many of our products such as our clothes. Maybe you enjoy using software, but why not start creating it for yourself? This course is part of the Africa Code Week initiative to bring coding skills to young people across the continent, and will show you how to get started with computer programming! You never know where it might lead \u2013 you might even end up using your new coding skills in your job one day! And if you\u2019ve never done any programming before \u2013 no problem \u2013 this is the place to start. All you need is some free time and a bit of curiosity. You\u2019ll be truly astonished at what you can do in next to no time!The course is based around the popular Scratch system that is capturing the imagination of young people around the globe.
