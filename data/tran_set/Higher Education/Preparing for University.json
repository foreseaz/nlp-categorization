These are university-level skills but you can work on the foundations of these skills before you get there. Such skills will also help in assessments such as A-levels and extended project work. They are also attributes that employers value in graduates.\n\nIn this course you will explore some key skills needed for success at university. You will hear what university lecturers have to say about skills their students excel at, or struggle with, from undergraduates about areas they have found difficult and some top tips for coping with the university learning environment.\n\nAt the end of each week there will be an exercise where you will be self-critical and reflect on your progress. These are such important skills for university because they form the basis of independent learning. Each week you will interact with others on the course, compare progress, help those who might be struggling, gain advice and support if you are struggling, and share your thoughts via discussions.\n\nThis course will also prepare you well for the teacher-led \u2018Pre-university Skills Programme\u2019.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Preparing for University", "price": 0, "instructors": "Harriet Jones", "institution_name": ["University of East Anglia"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/preparing-for-uni?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
