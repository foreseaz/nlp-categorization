Running the adequate programs, a computer may produce predictions on the location of the thousands of genes in a living organism and the functions of the proteins these genes code for.\r\nYou are not a biologist?\u00a0Attending this course, you will be introduced to several entities and processes involved in the interpretation of the genomic texts: cell, chromosome, DNA, genome, genes, transcription, translation, proteins and many more.\r\nYou are not a computer scientist?\u00a0This course is also an introduction to algorithms on character strings: pattern searching, sequence similarity, Markov chain models, or phylogenetic tree reconstruction are some basic algorithms which are implied in genome sequence analysis and will be explained.\r\nYou are neither a biologist nor a computer scientist?\u00a0This course is a great opportunity to a joint approach to genomics and algorithmics, or if you prefer, to algorithmics and genomics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1\u00a0DNA and genomic sequences\r\nWeek 2 Genes and proteins\r\nWeek 3 Prediction of genes\r\nWeek 4 Sequence Comparison\r\nWeek 5 phylogenetic trees\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Bioinformatics: Genomes and Algorithms", "price": 0, "instructors": "Francois Rechenmann", "institution_name": ["Inria (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation)"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41007/session01/about", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["France Universit\u00e9 Numerique"], "start_date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
