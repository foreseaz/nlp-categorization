How do humans contribute to climate change? Is a completely renewable energy supply possible? To explore our possible futures, we need models.\n\nGet an introduction to economic modeling\nIn this free online course, you\u2019ll learn how to develop and use models in environmental economics and energy economics, covering both conceptual aspects and numerical modeling.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss topical issues like climate change and energy policies. Together, we\u2019ll explore different modeling approaches, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss how to interpret and use their results to make informed decisions.\n\nDevelop your own economic model\nIn exercises, you\u2019ll be taken through the steps of developing a simple environmental or energy economics model, and use this model to assess policy.\n\nThe course benefits from being part of the educational programme of the Swiss Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society and Transition (SCCER CREST), which brings together research groups from eight major Swiss research institutions. CREST provides state-of-the-art research and detailed, evidence-based recommendations on current problems of energy policy.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Exploring Possible Futures: Modeling in Environmental and Energy Economics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Julia von Esebeck, Hannes Weigt and Frank Krysiak", "institution_name": ["University of Basel"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/exploring-possible-futures?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
