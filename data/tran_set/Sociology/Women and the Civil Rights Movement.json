Throughout\nwe will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement\ntheorists, and historians alike:\u00a0\ndeveloping and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths\nand weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence\nand securing long-range objectives.\u00a0 We\nwill also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender\ndynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing\nand social change.\u00a0 In the process, we\nconsider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in\nthe U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of\ncitizenship and rights more broadly. \u00a0\u00a0Our concern throughout the course will be to\nnot only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians\nwork to make sense of the past.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Women and the Civil Rights Movement", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. Elsa Barkley Brown", "institution_name": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "commitment": "8-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/womencivilrights", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
