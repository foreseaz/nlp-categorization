The course will then review the psychological factors at play in individual radicalization and recruitment into terrorism, followed by an analysis of terrorist group dynamics. The course will next look at terrorist group operations, including their attacks and some of the supporting behaviors that allow them to carry out attacks, including use of media, financing, recruitment, and training. The course will conclude by looking at the factors that drive terrorist group persistence or endurance versus terrorist group desistance, and will bring the varied course concepts together through a detailed look at the case of Al-Qa\u2019ida.  \n\nThroughout the course, students will have the opportunity to study and work with the University of Maryland\u2019s Global Terrorism Database (GTD), the largest database of terrorist incidents in the world, learning its capabilities and developing basic skills in searching and displaying terrorism data.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionAfter the completion of this module, you will be able to: 1) Comfortably navigate course pages; 2) Understand the course structure and requirements; 3) Post on the discussion forums.Module 1: How Do We Study Terrorism?At the completion of this module, you will be able to: 1) Explain the necessity for an interdisciplinary approach to studying terrorism; 3) Describe the most commonly held myths about terrorism; 2) Describe challenges and definitional issues related to the empirical study of terrorism; and 4) Describe geographic trends in terrorism from 1970-2012.
