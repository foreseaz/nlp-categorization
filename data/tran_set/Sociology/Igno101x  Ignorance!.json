Ignorance is relevant to every discipline and profession, and to everyday life, both at work and at play.\u00a0No matter what domain you study or work in,\u00a0this course will have something to offer to you.\n\nWe will explore questions about ignorance such as: Where does ignorance come from? How do we impose ignorance on each other, and even on ourselves?\u00a0And why?\u00a0We usually think about ignorance as a bad thing, but can it be preferable not to know something?\u00a0How do we use ignorance?\u00a0What roles does ignorance play in social interaction, group relations, institutions, and law?\u00a0Can ignorance sometimes be a virtue?\u00a0 When can ignorance be good or bad for us?\u00a0How can we harness the unknown for learning, discovery, and creativity?\u00a0\n\nYour understanding of ignorance will be expanded via online games, discussion forums, opportunities to find out what your own \u201cignorance profile\u201d is, additional readings, and Wiki materials. There also will be discussion threads specifically for those of you who want to apply understandings about ignorance to complex social and environmental problems.\u00a0Knowing more about ignorance will help you to manage and work with it. It also will help you in dealing with the unexpected, and with complex problems.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-07-28T00:00:00Z", "title": "Igno101x: Ignorance!", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gabriele Bammer and Michael Smithson", "institution_name": ["Australian National University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/ignorance-anux-igno101x", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
