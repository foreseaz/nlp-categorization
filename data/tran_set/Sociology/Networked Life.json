They have been the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics and finance. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way.\nNetworked Life will explore recent scientific efforts to explain social, economic and technological structures -- and the way these structures interact -- on many different scales, from the behavior of individuals or small groups to that of complex networks such as the Internet and the global economy.\nThis course covers computer science topics and other material that is mathematical, but all material will be presented in a way that is accessible to an educated audience with or without a strong technical background. The majority of the course is grounded in scientific and mathematical findings of the past two decades or less (often much less).\nNetworked Life is the flagship course of the new Networked and Social Systems Engineering program at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Networked Life", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Kearns", "institution_name": ["University of Pennsylvania"], "commitment": "1-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/networks", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
