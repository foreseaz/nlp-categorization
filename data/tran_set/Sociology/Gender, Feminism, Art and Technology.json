Students in this course will learn to acknowledge their context, privileges and disadvantages, and the different ways they have of knowing the world. In this course, learning and teaching will be generative, fluid processes. Much of the hard work of this course will be outside the classroom: reading, thinking, organizing and providing situated context for our ideas so our class colleagues can come to a fuller, richer understanding of our own shared and individual experiences. The students and instructor will come together to discover and explore the ideas shaped by the readings, and build emergent systems that provide deeper understanding of our own boundaries and possibilities.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Welcome Course Introduction\r\nSession 2: Gender Studies/ Feminist Studies 101 Jump into readings and wiki editing workshop.\r\nSession 3: The Histories Of Sexuality, Gender, And Identity Read \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist- Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century,\" in Simians, Cyborgs and Women, \"Split Subjects, Not Atoms; or, How I Fell in Love with My Prosthesis.\" The Cyborg Handbook, and \"Tinysex and Gender Trouble.\" Sex/Machine: Readings in Culture, Gender and Technology.\r\nSession 4: Technology And Vision Read \"Digitizing race: Visual cultures of the Internet\", and \"Entering the picture: Judy Chicago, the Fresno Feminist Art Program and the collective visions of women artists\".\r\nSession 5: Technology, Gender, And Desire Read works from Judith Halberstam, Adranne Wadewitz, and Amy Adele Hasinoff.
