In this religion course, learners explore case studies about how religions are internally diverse, how they evolve and change through time, and how religions are embedded in all dimensions of human experience. We\u2019ll explore these tenets through the lens of scripture and through themes such as gender and sexuality, art, violence and peace, science, and power and authority.\n\nJoin me and peers from around the world to embark on this journey to better understand religion in human affairs.\n\nThis is the first religion course in a series of World Scriptures courses from HarvardX:\n\nChristianity\n\tBuddhism\n\tIslam\n\tHinduism\n\tJudaism\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-06T00:00:00Z", "title": "HDS 3221.1x: Religious Literacy: Traditions and Scriptures", "price": 0, "instructors": "Diane L.
