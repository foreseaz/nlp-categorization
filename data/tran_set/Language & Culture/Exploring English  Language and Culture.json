Filmed in Great Britain, these videos will help you to develop your listening skills as you watch authentic examples of people speaking English. Our experienced tutor will examine some of the language used in the videos and will draw your attention to useful points that will help you improve your spoken and written English.\n\nThe course does not follow a language syllabus but takes authentic English in context as its starting point. Short quizzes and discussions will help you measure your understanding and practise your English throughout the course. At the end of each week you will be asked to describe your own feelings and experiences about that week\u2019s topic in a short piece of writing.\n\nThe course draws on the British Council\u2019s expertise in online learning. It is one of three courses from its Exploring English course collection.\n\nYou can find out more about this course in Chris Cavey\u2019s post for the FutureLearn blog: \u201c3 tips for getting the most out of Exploring English.\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Exploring English: Language and Culture", "price": 0, "instructors": "Chris Cavey", "institution_name": ["British Council"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/explore-english-language-culture?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
