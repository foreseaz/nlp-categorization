As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca \u2013 a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue \u2013 is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00Z", "title": "EBA101x: English for Doing Business in Asia \u2013 Speaking", "price": 0, "instructors": "Delian Gaskell and Sean McMinn", "institution_name": ["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/english-doing-business-asia-speaking-hkustx-eba101x-0", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
