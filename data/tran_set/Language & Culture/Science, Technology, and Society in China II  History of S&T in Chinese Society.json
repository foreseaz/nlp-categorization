Concepts\nsuch as path dependency/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others\nwill be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and\ntechnology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed\nby developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we\ncan understand how that series of events affected the development of science\nand technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation\nfor Part III.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Science, Technology, and Society in China II: History of S&T in Chinese Society", "price": 0, "instructors": "Naubahar Sharif", "institution_name": ["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina2", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z"}
