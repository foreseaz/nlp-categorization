Part II will examine the impact of the Industrial\nRevolution in the West on scientific and technological progress in China.\nPart III will examine science and technology in Chinese society today and\nthe basis for the policy prescriptions the Chinese government is currently\nemploying to promote innovation and technology development.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Definitional IssuesWeek 2: Impact of Modern Science and Technology (S&amp;T) in ChinaWeek 3: Systems of Innovation and Innovation Policy\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Science, Technology, and Society in China I: Basic Concepts", "price": 0, "instructors": "Naubahar Sharif", "institution_name": ["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
