It includes extensive coverage of the relational model, relational algebra, and SQL. It also covers XML data including DTDs and XML Schema for validation, and the query and transformation languages XPath, XQuery, and XSLT. The course includes database design in UML, and relational design principles based on dependencies and normal forms. Many additional key database topics from the design and application-building perspective are also covered: indexes, views, transactions, authorization, integrity constraints, triggers, on-line analytical processing (OLAP), JSON, and emerging NoSQL systems. Working through the entire course provides comprehensive coverage of the field, but most of the topics are also well-suited for \"a la carte\" learning.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Databases", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jennifer Widom", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.class2go.uwa.edu.au/IntroDB/Semester22013/preview/", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Stanford OpenEdx"], "start_date": "2013-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
