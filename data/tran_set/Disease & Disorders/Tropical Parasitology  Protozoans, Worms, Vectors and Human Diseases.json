The specific parasites for discussion include malaria, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, cestodes (Taenia saginata, Taenia solium, and Echinococcus), trematodes (Schistosoma and Fasciola), nematodes (Ancylostoma/Necator, Strongyloides, filariasis, and Ascaris), and ectoparasites. An emphasis will be placed on field demonstrations of relevance in sub-Saharan Africa and clinical presentations of parasitic illness, including their life cycles, vectors of transmission, distribution and \nepidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, treatment, \nand prevention and control. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The overall objective of this course is to acquaint medical school and graduate-level students with tropical parasitology and entomology. The course complements the\nclassical or traditional teaching of tropical parasitology and entomology.\nOther individuals interested in tropical parasitology and entomology will benefit equally. Course content covers epidemiology, transmission cycle, clinical manifestations, treatment and control of parasites in the following categories:\n\n\nProtozoa, including: malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis;\nNematodes, including: filariasis, ascariasis, hookworm, strongyloidiasis;\nCestodes, including: taeniasis, cystcercosis, echinococcosis;\nTrematodes, including: schistosomiasis, fascioliasis;\nEctoparasites, including: fleas, ticks and mites, and lice.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Tropical Parasitology: Protozoans, Worms, Vectors and Human Diseases", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Bartlett, Franklin Mosha and Mramba Nyindo", "institution_name": ["Duke University"], "commitment": "8-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/parasitology", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
