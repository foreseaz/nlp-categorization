Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and\u00a0environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning.This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological). Clinical topics covered include approaches to assessment, medication treatments (stimulant and non-stimulant), and non-medical interventions.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: BasicsDiagnostic CriteriaPrevalence, EpidemiologyClinical Case Presentations - Children, adolescents, adultsWeeks 2-5: BiologyGenetic FactorsPrenatal and Perinatal FactorsNeuroanatomyNeurochemistrySummary of Neurobiology of ADHDWeek 6: PsychologyIntellectual DevelopmentLearning Disabilities, Speech and Language DisordersEmotional Self Control and MotivationExecutive Functioning - Working Memory, Organization PlanningWeek 7: Health &amp; Long Term OutcomesHealth Status/Sleep ProblemsRisk Taking Behaviors (Smoking, Sexuality, Substance Abuse)Accidents, Injuries, Driving DifficultiesLong Term Outcomes of ADHDComorbid ConditionsExternalizing Disorders (ODD, CD) and Substance AbuseInternalizing Disorders (i.e. Mood and Anxiety Disorders)Week 8: AssessmentDiagnostic InterviewingBehavior Rating Scales, School Performance MeasuresWeeks 9-10: Medical TreatmentMedications - Stimulants / Review of the LiteratureMedications - Stimulants / Mechanisms of ActionMedications - Misuse and Abuse of StimulantsMedications - Atomoxetine / Alpha AgonistsWeeks 11-12: Treatment 2Behavior Management: Home and SchoolExercise, Nutrition, Sleep HygieneCognitive Behavioral TherapyNeurocognitive Training\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "\"Pay Attention!!\" ADHD Through the Lifespan", "price": 0, "instructors": "Anthony L.
