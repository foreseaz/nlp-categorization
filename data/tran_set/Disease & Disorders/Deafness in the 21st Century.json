For those\nwho are born deaf this is the area most at risk. Unless you have personal\nexperience of deafness in your work or a family member who is deaf you may\nnever have thought about this topic. As deafness is invisible the 350 million\nindividuals worldwide who are deaf, half of this is preventable, are at the\nfringe of many societies. \n\nThis short course\nwill allow you to consider health, social and societal issues in relation to\ndeafness. You will understand how the hearing system works and what can go\nwrong, particular challenges in low and middle income countries, about\nscreening and diagnostic services, amplification including solar powered aids,\nchallenges to inter-personal communication, sign language and positive stories\nabout what deaf individual can and do achieve. This will challenge stereotypes and will promote a positive message about deafness in the 21st century.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.\t Deafness:\u00a0a global perspective\nof the silent epidemicThe global inequalities and implications for deaf children, young people\nand adults.An introduction to the hearing system and basic physiology.\u00a0Understanding the auditory system.2.\u00a0Preventable cause of\ndeafnessEpidemiology of hearing loss in low and middle income countries.Prevention of hearing impairment and disability, including noise damage,\nototoxicity, age related hearing loss, middle ear disease and measles, mumps,\nrubella and malaria as causes of deafness.3.\u00a0Identification and assessment of deafness and amplificationScreening, diagnostic assessment, the potential and challenge of\namplification.The role of NGOs and manufacturing companies in provision of\namplification.Examples of practice.\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0Family Centred Early\nInterventionConsideration of the international consensus statement on family centred\nearly intervention.Examples of how this can apply in a low income countries.Developing early communication and literacy skills, empowering parents and working with the Deaf community.\u00a0\u00a05.\tFostering interpersonal communication across language modalitiesUse of signed languagesSpeechreadingSpoken languageFacilitating communication\u00a0\u00a06.\tPossible futures:  given support, what can deaf children and adults achieve?Case studies of possible futuresFocus on international projects\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "Deafness in the 21st Century", "price": 0, "instructors": "Wendy Mccracken and Helen Chilton", "institution_name": ["University of Manchester"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/deafness", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
