We examine the effect of trauma and maltreatment on the mental health and well being of children and which factors protect against the negative impact of such significant negative life events. \u00a0Past and current conceptualisations will be considered within applied settings to question how these conceptualisations help assessment and intervention for children and young people.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek 4:\nThe Psychology of Adolescence\u00a0Stella Chan\n\nIn week four we will examine the psychology of adolescence and why adolescent development is a key period for individual transition, but also a period in which major mental health difficulties emerge. \u00a0We will also take a look at how adolescents are perceived and the role society plays in their development.\u00a0We will examine what makes adolescents vulnerable to emotional health problems and approaches of psychological interventions. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek 5:\nApplied Developmental Psychopathology part IMatthias Schwannauer \n\nIn this final week we will look at models of psychological development and approaches to developmental psychopathology.
