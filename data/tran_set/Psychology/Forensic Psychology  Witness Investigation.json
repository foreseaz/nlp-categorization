Psychological research has revealed the dangers of relying on evidence gained from an eyewitness and also how careful the police need to be when questioning witnesses.\n\nUsing videos of real witnesses and from cameras that go behind the scenes of a police investigation, this course explores the psychology of eyewitness testimony. You will get the chance to test your own cognitive skills and to see whether your powers of investigation are as good as a crack squad of police officers, as you try to solve a crime using nothing but evidence from eyewitnesses.\n\nYou can use the hashtag #FLforensic16 to join and contribute to Twitter conversations about this course.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Forensic Psychology: Witness Investigation", "price": 0, "instructors": "Graham Pike", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/forensic-psychology?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
