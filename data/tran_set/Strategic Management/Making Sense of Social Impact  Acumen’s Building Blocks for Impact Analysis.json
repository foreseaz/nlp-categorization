Is it just the number of lives impacted?\u00a0How do we know if the goods and services our companies provide\u00a0are improving\u00a0lives? When do social and financial goals coincide, and when do they deviate? These questions are core to our work to create a world beyond poverty.\r\nTogether with Acumen\u2019s Impact Team, we\u2019ve developed this\u00a0introductory course to help you understand how we analyze\u00a0impact\u00a0in our portfolio and how you can apply the same building blocks to any socially-focused company or organization that you are personally excited about.\r\nWe believe this course will be especially insightful for those interested in impact investing, but it is by no means limited to that audience. Whether you are a philanthropist, an individual working at a non-profit, an impact investor or\u00a0an\u00a0social entrepreneur, or if you just want to understand what it might take for you to \u201cdo good\u201d more effectively, this course is for you.\r\nThe world needs you to lead.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Making Sense of Social Impact: Acumen\u2019s Building Blocks for Impact Analysis", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "4-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/social-impact-2016-2", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
