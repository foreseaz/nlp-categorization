While strategy is critical, nonprofit leaders are often unable or unwilling to plan in the short-term to achieve long-lasting social change.\r\nThis course will help students develop successful strategies to achieve their organization's goals and make strides towards meaningful impact. Using the social problem of childhood obesity as a real world example, students will learn how to undertake the basic elements of strategy: defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, designing logic models, and establishing assessment criteria. These guidelines will provide students the foundation necessary to develop strategies for their own organizations that ensure long-term impact rather than just immediate results.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "Essentials of Nonprofit Strategy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Paul Brest", "institution_name": ["Philanthropy University"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://philanthropyuniversity.novoed.com/strategy-2016-2", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
