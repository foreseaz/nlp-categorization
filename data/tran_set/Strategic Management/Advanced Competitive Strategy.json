For this, we will take an analytical approach that helps us understand the point at which our customers will switch to a competitors and the amount of money a competitor is willing to spend to acquire our customers. Based on this understanding, we will derive applicable strategies that can help us lock in our customers strategically. We will do this by keeping in mind that also customers may apply their own strategies to avoid lock in and further, that our competitors will seek to apply strategies in the pursuit of making our customers theirs.Determine your Prices WiselyWe will look at the benefits of price discrimination as a strategic tool that can help us to skim off our customer\u2019s willingness to pay and increase our utility accordingly.
