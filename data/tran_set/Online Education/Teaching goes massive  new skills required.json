This is an attempt to educate anyone in this situation, and thereby empower everyone to anticipate changes in the field and make better professional decisions.\u00a0Part of the emphasis will be to explain the technology, because it was and will be a catalyst of further evolutions in education.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        There is no set syllabus for the course (see Course Format), beyond a proposition of covering the following topics:business: how companies and startups think;legal: copyright and privacy issues;pedagogical: how technology makes good teaching practical;technological: Web 2.0, cloud services, interoperability standards, etc.The course might also include educated guesswork on what the next couple years might bring.\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Teaching goes massive: new skills required", "price": 0, "instructors": "Paul-Olivier Dehaye", "institution_name": ["University of Zurich"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
