The course is organized into five \u201cpursuits,\u201d each of which represents one facet of the world of OERs. Participants are encouraged to complete all of the pursuits by following the suggested course progression, but each pursuit can also be completed individually. For evaluation and feedback, OER-101 will employ a badging system powered by\u00a0Mozilla Open Badges. Participants will earn badges by completing the course pursuits and will receive a \u2018master badge\u2019 for course completion.\u00a0Additionally, OER-101 will utilize a community learning model informed by a facilitation method established by Phylise Banner at the American Public University System. The results from this course will be documented within the\u00a0SUNY Learning Commons.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Locating, Creating, Licensing and Utilizing OERs", "price": 0, "instructors": "Beth Burns and Mark McBride", "institution_name": ["State University of New York"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.coursesites.com/webapps/Bb-sites-course-creation-BBLEARN/courseHomepage.htmlx?course_id=_226718_1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open Education by Blackboard"], "start_date": "2013-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
