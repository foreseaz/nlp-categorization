Part Two begins early in the twentieth century, as older ways of doing things and habits of thought give way.  What follows is an era of cataclysmic struggles over what ideas and institutions will take their place.  The course concludes in the present day, as communities everywhere are transitioning into a new era of world history.  Again we work hard to grasp what is happening and ask:  Why?  Again we are drawn to pivotal choices made at key moments by individuals and communities.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Crackup (1905-1917)New Orders Emerge (1917-1930)The Crisis of the World (1930-1940)Total War and Aftermath (1940-1950)The Return of Wartime (1950-1968)Decay and Renaissance (1968-1991)The Next Phase (1991-2013)\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Modern World, Part Two: Global History since 1910", "price": 0, "instructors": "Philip Zelikow", "institution_name": ["University of Virginia"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
