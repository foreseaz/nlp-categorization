It combines theory with practice,\ngiving you the option to respond to some of the iconic images we will explore,\nand to create and share your own images.\n\nIt will provide an introduction to the\nprocesses, people and images associated with early photography, starting in 1839\nwhen Louis Daguerre announced the daguerreotype image in France, and WHF Talbot\nunveiled the calotype process in England. You will have the chance to learn\nabout the personalities, processes and social contexts of the rise of\nphotography.\n\nThroughout, you will hear from a\nrange of people who are passionate about photography in the 19th\ncentury. We will focus on specific images and techniques, ranging from\nhigh end studio portraiture, iconic landscapes and cityscapes and the rise of\nitinerant and beach photography for the masses. There will be opportunity\nfor you, the course participant, to respond to some of these images with your\nown photographic experiments and to share your own family album.\nThe course is\nlinked to a new major exhibition from the National Museum of Scotland called\nPhotography, A Victorian Sensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the discussion on twitter: #vicphotomooc\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 - First ImagesIntroduces the first photographic processes, unveiled in 1839 - the daguerreotype, by Parisian Louis Jacque Mand\u00e9 Daguerre\nand the calotype, by Englishman WHF Talbot, which Hill &amp; Adamson used to produce around 3,000 images between 1843 and 1848.Week 2 - 1851: A Year to Remember\u00a0With the Great Exhibition in London and two major milestones in the development of photography: first, stereoscopy, the 3D sensation and\u00a0 second, the new, faster wet collodion process that made outdoor photography much easier.Week 3 -\u00a0Studio Photography, Amateur Photography\u00a0In 1851 there had\nbeen about a dozen photographic studios in London; by 1866 this number had\nincreased to 284.\u00a0 Photography became\nextremely fashionable, particularly in the new carte-de-visite and stereo\nforms.\u00a0 Amateur photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, photographed the writers, artists, scientists in her social circle.Week 4 - Stereo Sensation\u00a0Following the\npresentation of the lenticular stereoscopic viewer at the Great Exhibition,\nviewing the world in 3D became a Victorian craze. The experience of\nusing a stereoscope was described as \u2018mesmerising\u2019. The London\nStereoscopic Company, formed in 1854, had as its slogan: \u2018no home without a\nstereoscope\u2019. Week 5 - Photography for EveryoneWe\nlook at how photography rapidly moves from an expensive, amateur hobby, to\nreaching the masses, with the growth of cheap \u2018tintypes\u2019 and beach photography,\nand end with the impact of the Kodak camera, marketed with the slogan \"You press the button and we do the rest\". \n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Photography: A Victorian Sensation", "price": 0, "instructors": "Alison Morrison-Low", "institution_name": ["University of Edinburgh"], "commitment": "1-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/vicphoto", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
