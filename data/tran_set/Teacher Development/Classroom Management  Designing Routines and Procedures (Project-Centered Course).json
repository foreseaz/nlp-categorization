It's what educators always wish they had more of. But unless the school day or the school year is extended, the only way for a teacher to dedicate more class time to instruction is by designing and teaching meaningful procedures to their students.   What you\u2019ll achieve: In this project-centered course*, you will create a meaningful procedures plan that will help you save time in your classroom and improve the efficacy of your teaching. You\u2019ll identify time-wasting moments, and minimize the time spent on procedures (such as moving students around your classroom) that tend to consume valuable teaching time. You\u2019ll also prepare to implement your plan, beginning with teaching the new procedural protocols to your students.  What you\u2019ll need to get started: Although anyone can benefit from the principles we\u2019re teaching, this project-based course is specifically designed for educators who work with young people. If you're a classroom teacher, after-school coach, music teacher, youth group leader, or student studying to be a teacher, this course is for you.  *About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you\u2019ll master the course content more efficiently; you\u2019ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you\u2019ll have a finished project that you\u2019ll be proud to use and share.  Time: 1 hour of study, 2 hours of active project work\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Classroom Management: Designing Routines and Procedures (Project-Centered Course)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Julie Jackson", "institution_name": ["Relay Graduate School of Education"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/classroom-procedures", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
