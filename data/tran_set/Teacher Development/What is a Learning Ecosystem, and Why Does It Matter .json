As a result, present-day learning professionals are grappling with self-directed, independent learners who are savvier, more participative, and less attentive to one-dimensional, telling-type training solutions.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThis course will enable participants to:\r\n\r\nDefine the term \u201clearning ecosystem\u201d and explain how the definition applies to their workplace.\r\nCreate a visual representation of their workplace learning ecosystem (as an infographic, Visio chart, mind map, Canva, drawing, or other images that depict data, information, and relationships).\r\nDetermine their zone of influence within their workplace learning ecosystem and identify at least one element of the system they can impact.\r\nDevelop a plan to leverage their workplace learning ecosystem in a way that improves human performance within the organization.\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "What is a Learning Ecosystem, and Why Does It Matter?", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kim Whiteside", "institution_name": ["Metropolitan Community College"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/mcc/courses/learning-ecosystems", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
