{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Teacher Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This course is designed to encourage educators to develop new creative habits that foster personal learning networks, content creation, and innovative learning practices that embrace curiosity, failure and reflection. Each week a new creative habit is explored through the examination and understanding of one\u2019s own relationship to creativity.\r\nThe goal of this class will be to increase awareness of personal creativity, to encourage new learning connections in an online environment, to enhance self- expression, and to increase confidence in the use of digital tools through project based activities. Participants are encouraged to share and interact to facilitate a connectivist attitude, get feedback from their peers, and to forge meaningful and personalized ideas about what living a creative life is all about. Educators will be encouraged to tap into their own creative potential while drawing on the synergy created by participating in a creative learning community.\r\nJoin us in exploring the power and richness of creativity in our lives. Our hope is that participants will not only draw new meaning and strength from this process, but in turn will provide active and empowering contributions in their own learning communities.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-11-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Five Habits of Highly Creative Teachers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Cathleen Nardi", "institution_name": ["Northwest Colorado BOCES"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/five-habits-of-highly-creative-teachers", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
