Are you thinking of using different ways to engage your learners? Do you toss and turn at night wondering if your materials have been effective and useful for your learners? Enroll in this short course to pick up some tips on using a range of instructional methods to engage your adult learners and make their learning relevant and meaningful.\r\nAs a needs-based course, we will first determine the type of program you are currently or will be facilitating, and then recommend a range of instructional methods that are relevant to your learners and the learning outcomes for the program.\r\nWith the help of video resources, short notes, formative quizzes, and forum discussions, you will engage with the learning materials both individually and with a community of like-minded practitioners. Hear from experts how they adapt these instructional methods for their own facilitation purposes, and start or join conversations to discuss these methods at greater length and depth.\r\nThis course is for both new and experienced trainers.\r\nAs the course design is based on your needs as a trainer, there is no need for you to work through everything, only what you deem relevant to you. This will take about a week. However, if you feel that you want to find out about instructional methods that are not immediately relevant to you now, you are most welcome to explore the rest of the course. This will take approximately three more weeks.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Helping Adults Learn by Using Appropriate Instructional Methods", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Institute for Adult Learning"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/ial/courses/helping-adults-learn", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
