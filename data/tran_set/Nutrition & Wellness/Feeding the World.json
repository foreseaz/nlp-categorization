Each of the major food animal species (dairy, swine, beef, and poultry) will be covered in terms of their universal life cycles, constraints to production and emerging societal issues.\u00a0Throughout the course, we will tackle some difficult and important questions:What are the major health benefits and potential concerns regarding the production and consumption of animal products?How does animal production affect the efficient use of resources and impact our environment?Can cost of production be reduced to meet growing demand for animal products around the globe while maintaining health and safety for both animals and consumers?What are the different types of animal food production systems?Myths and misconceptions surrounding the animal food systems will be discussed. We\u2019ll also look closely at some of the global issues, problems, and challenges in these food systems which scientists, farmers, and veterinarians, are attempting to solve through collaboration.Lectures will be delivered by several experts from the University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine who are intimately involved in the study and advancement of animal production systems. The course is geared towards learners who seek a greater understanding of animal food systems as well as those who might have never visited an animal farm, but have a desire to learn more about where some of our food comes from and issues surrounding sustainability.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK ONE: \u00a0POPULATION GROWTH AND GLOBAL ANIMAL INDUSTRIESAnimal food systems will be introduced and we\u2019ll look at production processes here and across the globe with an eye on our growing population, demands of emerging economies, and more.WEEK TWO: \u00a0ISSUES SURROUNDING ANIMAL PRODUCTIONThe benefits, concerns, ethical aspects, and management of environmental resources used in animal production systems will be discussed.WEEK THREE: ANIMAL FEED, THE ENVIRONMENT AND GENETICSWe\u2019ll explore the what, how, and why aspects of animal feeding and how its production affects our environment. We\u2019ll also talk about genetic selection and emerging technologies in animal breeding.WEEK FOUR: GENERAL ANIMAL PRODUCTION,\u00a0EFFICIENCY, AND FOOD SAFETYThe final weeks of the course will focus on specific animal systems. We\u2019ll look at each (dairy cows, swine, poultry and beef cows) in terms of their industry trends, animal life cycles, different types of production systems and myths and issues surrounding them.WEEK FIVE: \u00a0DAIRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMSWEEK SIX: \u00a0SWINE PRODUCTION SYSTEMSWEEK SEVEN: POULTRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMSWEEK EIGHT: BEEF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Feeding the World", "price": 0, "instructors": "David Galligan and James Ferguson", "institution_name": ["University of Pennsylvania"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/feedingtheworld", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z"}
