You will study state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for collaborative filtering, ensemble methods (e.g., random forests), clustering and topic modeling, with a focus on model parallelism and the crucial tradeoffs between computation and communication.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will have a thorough understanding of the statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop and deploy distributed machine learning pipelines. You will further have the expertise to write efficient and scalable code in Spark, using MLlib and the spark.ml package in particular.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "CS125x: Advanced Distributed Machine Learning with Apache Spark", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ameet Talwalkar and Jon Bates", "institution_name": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "commitment": "5-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-distributed-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs125x", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
