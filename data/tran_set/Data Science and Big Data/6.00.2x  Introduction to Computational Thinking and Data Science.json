This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.\n\nTopics covered include:\n\nPlotting with the pylab package\n\tRandom walks\n\tProbability, Distributions\n\tMonte Carlo simulations\n\tCurve fitting\n\tKnapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization\n\tMachine learning basics, Clustering algorithms\n\tStatistical fallacies\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science", "price": 0, "instructors": "Eric Grimson and John Guttag", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-3", "duration": "9 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
