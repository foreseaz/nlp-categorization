You will learn about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. The qualitative approach often involves an iterative process. We will focus on the basic ingredients required for this process: data collection and analysis. A good qualitative analysis consists of a general strategy of analysis, clear analytic 'actions' and documentation of all the steps taken. An important analytical action is coding parts of the material. This forms the basis for the categorisation and interpretation of the data. In this course you will learn to use statistical software to perform the qualitative analysis. We will also discuss and compare different types of analysis and interpretation. The most important concepts in qualitative analysis will be discussed in light of these different types.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The qualitative approach to empirical science has its own origin story and is associated with a different philosophy of science than the quantitative approach. In this course you will learn about the qualitative way of thinking, but also about data collection, description, analysis and interpretation in qualitative research. You will gain hands on experience with interviewing and observation and practice analysis of this type of data using statistical software.Week 1: Introduction\u00a0\u2022\tintroduction to qualitative methods\u00a0\u2022\tphilosophy of science\u00a0\u2022\tdifferences between qualitative versus quantitative approaches\u2022\tmixed-methods\u2022\twarm-up assignments (not graded)Week 2: Qualitative traditions\u00a0\u2022\thistory of qualitative methods\u00a0\u2022\tintroduction to ethnography\u2022\tresearch design in ethnography\u2022\tquiz and small assignment (graded)Week 3: Observation and field notes\u00a0\u2022\taccess and role of the researcher\u2022\tfield notes\u2022\tsampling\u00a0\u2022\tquiz and paper on week 1 &amp; 2 (graded)Week 4: Organization and analysis\u2022\trecording data\u2022\torganzing data\u00a0\u2022\tanalysis of observational data\u2022\tquiz and small assignment (graded)Week 5: Interviewing\u2022\tdifference between structured and qualitative interview\u00a0\u2022\tinterviewing versus observation\u2022\tasking questions\u2022\tquiz and paper on week 3 &amp; 4 (graded)Week 6: Data analysis\u2022\tcontent analysis\u2022\tanalytical induction\u2022\tgrounded theory\u2022\tquiz and small assignment (graded)Week 7: Study week\u2022\ttime to ask your final questions\u2022\ttime to work on last paperWeek 8: Exam week\u2022\tpaper on week 5 &amp; 6 (graded), final exam (graded) and course evaluation\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Qualitative Research Methods ", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gerben Moerman", "institution_name": ["University of Amsterdam"], "commitment": "4-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/qualitativemethods", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
