Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector. \u00a0In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of \u00a0linear algebra, and\u00a0how to use them\u00a0to think about problems arising in computer science. \u00a0You will write small programs in the programming language Python to \u00a0implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, classification of tumors as malignant or \u00a0benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, and secret-sharing.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The FunctionThe FieldThe VectorThe Vector SpaceThe MatrixThe BasisDimensionGaussian EliminationThe Inner ProductOrthogonalization\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-04-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications", "price": 0, "instructors": "Phil Klein", "institution_name": ["Brown University"], "commitment": "7-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
