This course is designed to provide students with algebraic knowledge needed for success in a typical calculus course. We explore a suite of functions used in calculus, including polynomials (with special emphasis on linear and quadratic functions), rational functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions. Along the way, basic strategies for solving equations and inequalities are reinforced, as are strategies for interpreting and manipulating a variety of algebraic expressions. Students enrolling in the course are expected to have good number sense and to have taken an intermediate algebra course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-06-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Precalculus Algebra", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Lorch, Ph.D.", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
