The general approach is to provide students with a framework that will help them choose the appropriate descriptive methods in various data analysis situations.\r\nProducing Data: This unit is organized into two sections \u2013 Sampling and Designing Studies\r\nProbability: This course contains a streamlined version of probability that forgoes the classical treatment of probability in favor of an empirical approach using relative frequency. This course includes only those concepts that are necessary to support a conceptual understanding of the role of probability in inference. For the full, classical treatment of Probability, students may see the OLI Probability and Statistics course.\r\nInference: This unit introduces students to the logic as well as the technical side of the main forms of inference: point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The unit covers inferential methods for the population mean and population proportion, inferential methods for comparing the means of two groups and of more than two groups (ANOVA), the Chi-Square test for independence and linear regression. The unit reinforces the framework that the students were introduced to in the Exploratory Data Analysis for choosing the appropriate, in this case, inferential method in various data analysis scenarios.\r\nThroughout the course there are many interactive elements. These include: simulations, \u201cwalk-throughs\u201d that integrate voice and graphics to explain an example of a procedure or a difficult concept, and, most prominently, interactive activities in which students practice problem solving, with hints and immediate and targeted feedback.\r\nThe course is built around a series of carefully devised learning objectives that are independently assessed.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Statistical Reasoning", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/OLI/StatReasoning/Open/about", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Stanford OpenEdx"], "start_date": "2016-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
