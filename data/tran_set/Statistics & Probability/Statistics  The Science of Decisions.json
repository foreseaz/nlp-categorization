Whether researching the best school, job, or relationship, the Internet has thrown open the doors to vast pools of data. Statistics are simply objective and systematic methods for describing and interpreting information so that you may make the most informed decisions about life.\r\n\r\nWhy Take This Course?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe applications of statistics to everyday life\r\nMethods for acquiring data through observation and experimentation\r\nTo organize and describe quantitative and categorical forms of data\r\nAnticipating patterns using basic probability and sampling\r\nStatistical inference through estimation and hypothesis testing\r\nCorrelation and simple regression\r\nWays of describing the strength of relationships between variables\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites and Requirements\r\n\r\nIt sounds strange to say, but math is not the focus of this class. To do well, however, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of proportions (fractions, decimals, and percentages), negative numbers, basic algebra (solving equations), and exponents and square roots.\r\n\r\nSee the\u00a0Technology Requirements\u00a0for using Udacity\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introduction to Statistics and Methods\r\n\r\nLesson 1: Intro to statistical research methods\r\nLesson 2: Frequency Distributions &amp; Visualizing data\r\n\r\nModule 2: Describing Data\r\n\r\nLesson 3: Central Tendency\r\nLesson 4: Variability\r\nMidterm 1 on Lessons 1-4\r\n\r\nModule 3: Normal Distribution Analysis\r\n\r\nLesson 5: Standardized Scores (z-scores)\r\nLesson 6: Probability and the Normal Distribution\r\nLesson 7: Sampling Distributions\r\n\r\nModule 4: Foundations of Inferential Statistics\r\n\r\nLesson 8: Estimation\r\nLesson 9: Hypothesis Testing\r\n\r\nMidterm 2 on Lessons 5-9\r\nModule 5: Comparing Means\r\n\r\nLesson 10-11: t-tests\r\nLesson 12-13: One-way ANOVA\r\n\r\nModule 6: Correlation, Regression, and Non-Parametrics\r\n\r\nLesson 14: Correlation\r\nLesson 15: Regression (available soon)\r\nLesson 16: Chi-Squared Tests (available soon)\r\n\r\nFinal Exam on Lessons 10-16 (available soon)\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Statistics: The Science of Decisions", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sean Laraway, Ronald Rogers and Katie Kormanik", "institution_name": ["San Jose State University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/st095/CourseRev/1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2013-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
