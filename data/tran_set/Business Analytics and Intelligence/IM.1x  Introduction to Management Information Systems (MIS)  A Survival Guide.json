From customer relationship management (CRM) systems handling the daily\u00a0interactions with clients and prospects, to financial systems issuing invoices and paying bills, day-to-day\u00a0working life is increasingly controlled by these systems that dictate what to do and how.\n\nThis course will focus on what MIS are, how they influence your current or prospective jobs, why they impose specific - and sometimes seemingly absurd - operational procedures, and how to use this knowledge to your advantage in your professional life.\n\nGrasping the key concepts in MIS does not need to be daunting. We will use real world examples to illustrate key concepts, and strive to strike a proper balance between clarity / amenity and conceptual soundness. Join us on this stimulating journey that will allow you to better understand and perform in your current or desired job.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "IM.1x: Introduction to Management Information Systems (MIS): A Survival Guide", "price": 0, "instructors": "Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Miranda and Alfonso Dur\u00e1n Heras", "institution_name": ["Universidad Carlos iii de Madrid"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-management-information-uc3mx-im-1x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
