A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes. \u00a0This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes. \u00a0A third reason is that this is simply more interesting. \u00a0The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning. \u00a0It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course Outline\nThe Atomic Molecular Theory\nAtomic Masses and Molecular Formulae\nThe Structure of an Atom\nThe Electron Shell Model of an Atom\nQuantum Electron Energy Levels in an Atom\nElectron Orbitals and Electron Configurations in Atoms\nCovalent Bonding and Electron Pair Sharing\nMolecular Structures\nEnergy and Polarity of Covalent Chemical Bonds\nBonding in Metals and Metal-Non-Metals Salts\nMolecular Geometry\nMeasuring Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions\nReaction Energy and Bond Energy\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-05-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "Chemistry: Concept Development and Application", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Steven Hutchinson", "institution_name": ["Rice University"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/genchem1", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
