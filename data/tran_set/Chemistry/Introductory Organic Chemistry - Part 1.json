{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Chemistry"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This course surveys structural chemistry of organic compounds with an emphasis on electronic structure, conformation and stereochemistry. Concepts and models are developed to build intuition about the stability and reactivity of organic compounds. These concepts will prepare students for a mechanistic-based approach to learning organic reactivity. Emphasis will also be placed on developing problem-solving skills unique to organic chemistry. This course (Introductory Organic Chemistry Part I)\u00a0together with Introductory Organic Chemistry Part II\u00a0are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (Intermediate Organic Chemistry Parts I and II) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-veterinary programs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                            \nModule     \nKey Concepts \n\nWeek 1: The Building Blocks of Organic Chemistry\n Period 2 Elements\nFormal Charge\nStability Trends\nBonding Patterns\nFunctional Groups    \nWeek 2: The Language of Organic Chemistry\n Basic Organic Nomenclature\nMolecular Symmetry\nChirality\nStereochemical Descriptors\nRepresentations of 3-Dimensional Structures    \nWeek 3: Electrons in Molecules\n Resonance\nWave Properties of Electrons\nAtomic Orbitals\nLinear Combination of Atomic Orbitals    \nWeek 4: Molecular Orbital Theory\n Constructing Simple MO Diagrams\nInferring Reactivity From MO Diagrams\nThe Hybrid Orbital Approximation\nFrontier Orbital Theory    \nWeek 5: Molecules in Motion\n Conformations of Linear Molecules\nStability of Cyclic Molecules\nConformations of Cyclohexanes\nCoordinate Diagrams    \nWeek 6: Understanding Reactivity\n Bond Energy Changes\nTransition States\nNucleophiles and Electrophiles\nAcid-Base Equilibria    \nWeek 7: Organic Reactions, Part I\n Substitution Reactions\nElimination Reactions\nDiscriminating Related Reaction Mechanisms    \nWeek 8: Organic Reactions, Part II\n Stereospecificity of Substitution and Elimination Reaction Mechanisms\nCarbocation Rearrangements\nActivated C-O Electrophiles\nCarbon-Based Nucleophiles    \n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introductory Organic Chemistry - Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jeffrey S.
