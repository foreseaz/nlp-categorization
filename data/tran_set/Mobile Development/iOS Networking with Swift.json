{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Mobile Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    In this course, you\u2019ll learn how to incorporate networking into your apps, so they can access data from around the world. You\u2019ll learn how to harness the power of APIs to display images and retrieve movie data. At the end of the course, you\u2019ll build the \u201cOn the Map\u201d app which allows you to share interesting links, projects, or other information with fellow Udacity students.Why Take This Course?Without networking, mobile apps can only perceive, process, and present the data that is local to the host device. This greatly restricts the scope of problems which apps can solve and limits their overall utility. By incorporating networking, apps truly become \u201cmobile\u201d -- they can interact with interesting data using popular web services, coordinate multi-user activities, and build experiences that bring users together.\n\nThis course will cover concepts fundamental to communication over the network like HTTP, JSON, and authentication. These concepts are also highly transferrable to other platforms, languages, and applications. Additionally, it will mold your understanding of app design, especially when networking constraints are involved.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ###Lesson 1: Networking and Web Services\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll learn all about networks and how they work. You\u2019ll also build your first app that utilizes a web service: \u201cSleeping in the Library.\u201d This app uses the Flickr API to pull pictures of people sleeping in libraries.\n###Lesson 2: Building \u201cFlick Finder\u201d\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to parse JSON data and display it to a user. You\u2019ll demonstrate these new skills by building the \u201cFlick Finder\u201d app, which displays Flickr images based on a phrase or location.\n###Lesson 3: The MovieDB and Authentication\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll learn the difference between user and anonymously accessed data. You\u2019ll do so by building the \u201cMy Favorite Movies\u201d app that utilizes the Movie Database API.\n###Lesson 4: Improving Networking with MVC\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll improve on your \u201cMy Favorite Movies\u201d app to build the \u201cMovie Manager\u201d app. For this app, we\u2019ll be sure to use good MVC design, and learn what this means from a networking perspective.\n###Lesson 5: Preparing for \u201cOn the Map\u201d\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll start on your final project app, \u201cOn the Map.\u201d You\u2019ll also learn about network reliability, and how your app should behave if a network can\u2019t be reached.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "iOS Networking with Swift", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jarrod Parkes", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
