Learn (or re-learn) basic concepts, including Newton\u2019s laws, motion, momentum, and energy. Become a more competent and engaging teacher by familiarizing yourself with the historical development of these concepts, and with the physics education research literature about ways to teach the concepts effectively. Learn to employ research-based methods to help your students succeed in physics.\n\nIt covers the following content:\n\nKinematics\n\tProjectile motion\n\tForces and Newton\u2019s laws\n\tImpulse and work\n\tConservation of energy\n\tReadings of, and discussion about, the conceptual history of physics and relevant education research\nIn your final projects, you will develop a research-based lesson plan that you can use in your own teaching.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-22T00:00:00Z", "title": "ITOP1x: Force and Motion: Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Teaching Physics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Peter Garik and Andrew Duffy", "institution_name": ["Boston University"], "commitment": "8 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/force-motion-pedagogical-content-bux-itop1x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
