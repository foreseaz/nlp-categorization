You\u2019ll learn to break down the creative process into components, and you\u2019ll discover a structured process that allows you to produce a polished and pitch-ready script in just a few weeks. Completing this project will increase your confidence in your ideas and abilities, and you\u2019ll feel prepared to pitch your first script and get started on your next. \n\nThis is a course designed to tap into your creativity and is based in \"Active Learning\". Most of the actual learning takes place within your own activities - that is, writing! You will learn by doing.\n\n\"Thank you so much for your direct way of teaching this course. It was encouraging for us all to creatively flow and find our own voice in writing and developing our scripts. This aspect was very important to me.\" Ingrid\n\nThe course curriculum is simple: you\u2019ll write, revise your work, and share feedback with your peers. \n\nI am a proponent of Experiential Learning (active learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won\u2019t \"show\" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.\n\n\u201cDavid's lecture style for this course is inspired. The videos are succinct and engaging. When I watch the lectures I feel David\u2019s sincere desire for me to create something truly amazing. He is teaching us how to write a script, and he is providing wisdom and tools that will help us do so in a compelling way - by writing; not by watching him talk at us.\u201d - A R Adamson\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need to get started:\n\nTo begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.\n\nLearner Review: \"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David's guidance is spot on, he's his own compelling story teller, he gives you enough, and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! \"\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: This is a \u2018project-centered course\u2019, which means it is designed specifically to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.
