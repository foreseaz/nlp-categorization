This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing.We will cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.You will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. You will be exposed to historical works of art from the 20th and 21st centuries which will offer you a context for your artistic endeavors.Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 5 weeks you should have a strong foundation on how to use computers for image manipulation, and expression of your artistic ideas.Additionally, you\u2019ll create an online portfolio of your digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. \u00a0Each week you\u2019ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We\u2019re looking forward to working with you.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to Computational Arts: Visuals(Spring 2014)Consortium for Digital Arts &amp; Technology (CDACT)Stony Brook University and CourseraCOURSE INFORMATION Instructors:Dr. Margaret Schedel and Catherine KatsafourosCourse DescriptionThis multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to, and exploration of electronic media in the arts.
