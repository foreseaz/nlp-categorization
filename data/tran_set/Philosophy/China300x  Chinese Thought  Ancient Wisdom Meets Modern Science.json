Sometime known as the age of \u201cthe Hundred Schools of Thought,\u201d this period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought, which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. Important themes to be discussed include conceptions of the self, models of self-cultivation and rationality, and differences in spiritual and political ideals. Students will be exposed to both received texts and recently discovered archeological texts; this combination of sources will both enrich students\u2019 understanding of the world of thought in early China and call into question the boundaries drawn between the traditionally-defined \u201cschools\u201d such as Daoism or Confucianism. Parallels with developments in Western philosophical and religious traditions will be highlighted. We will also explore the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, as well as the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.\nAll required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Crown Publishers and Hackett Publishing Company.
