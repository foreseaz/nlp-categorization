We\u2019ll also look at the responsibilities states have for their own populations, as well as the wider international society.\n\nCrucially, we\u2019ll examine how remote control warfare is seen by those at its receiving end. Join us, as we ask:\n\n\n  Does remote control warfare make states more prone to waging war?\n  Does this recent trend influence the way states\u2019 security activities are policed?\n  Are drones an ignoble form of warfare, with a huge mismatch between the technological capabilities of each side?\n  Do private military companies allow states to undertake new, illegal and unethical activities?\n  Are special ops forces the optimum response to the public\u2019s aversion to fear?\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "From State Control to Remote Control: Warfare in the 21st Century", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["University of Bath"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/remote-control-warfare?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
