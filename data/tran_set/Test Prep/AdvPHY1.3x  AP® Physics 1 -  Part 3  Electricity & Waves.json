Increase your skills \u2013 and your readiness \u2013 for the AP Exam though quality videos, inquiry labs, Hollywood-style Concept Trailers\u2122, Direct Measurement Videos, AP problem-solving sessions and more!\n\nIn Part 3:\u00a0Electricity &amp; Waves, you will learn about a property of microscopic matter called charge and how it leads to attractive and repulsive forces between subatomic particles. The electric field will be described as a means to explain these forces, as well as how the field inside a metal leads to a flow of charge called current.\u00a0You will learn about the current and resistance in DC circuits.\u00a0Finally, the basic properties of waves will be described, and sound waves will be discussed as an example.\n\nThe enhanced AP Exam Prep PLUS 5 is bundled with the edX Verified Certificate.
