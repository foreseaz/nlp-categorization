You will examine how changes in the genetic makeup of a population happen over time and how these changes drive evolution and create diversity.\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP Biology teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems.\u00a0 By the end of the course, you will be prepared to take on the AP exam!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis course is authorized as an Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP\u00ae) course by the AP Course Audit.
