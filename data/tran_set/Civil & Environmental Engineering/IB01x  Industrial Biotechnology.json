This transition is not a luxury, but rather a necessity. We can use the unique properties of microorganisms to convert organic waste streams into biomaterials, chemicals and biofuels. This course provides the insights and tools for the design of biotechnology processes in a sustainable way. Five experienced course leaders will teach you the basics of industrial biotechnology and how to apply these to the design of fermentation processes for the production of fuels, chemicals and foodstuffs.\n\nThroughout this course, you will be challenged to design your own biotechnological process and evaluate its performance and sustainability. This undergraduate course includes guest lectures from industry as well as from the University of Campinas in Brazil, with over 40 years\u00a0of experience in bio-ethanol production. The course is a joint initiative of TU Delft, the international BE-Basic consortium and University of Campinas.\n\nLICENSE:\u00a0The course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-10-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "IB01x: Industrial Biotechnology", "price": 0, "instructors": "Henk Noorman, Sef Heijnen and Isabel Arends", "institution_name": ["Delft University of Technology"], "commitment": "8 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/industrial-biotechnology-delftx-ib01x-0", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
