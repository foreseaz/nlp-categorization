The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has already resulted and will continue to result in numerous challenges and opportunities. This course will help you to make the best out of the introduction of these smart technologies in your cities\u2019 legacy infrastructures.  \n\nOver the past few years, advancements in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable landscape of urban infrastructure services provision. The result is an increasing interest in the transitioning of cities towards so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d- an interest expressed both by technology vendors and public authorities. Although such \u201csmart technologies\u201d can provide immense opportunities for citizens and for service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\n\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with \u201csmart urban infrastructures\u201d as well as how these infrastructures can be managed in order to deliver desirable performance in cities. More precisely, throughout this 5-week MOOC you will learn about the most important principles for the management of smart urban infrastructures as well as about the application of these principles to two specific sectors, namely urban transportation and urban energy systems. \n\nThe course does not have any pre-requisits. However, in order to make the best of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our previous MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures which has been widely appraised by learners. \n\nThrough this course, students will:\n- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies that are and can be used for \u201csmart infrastructure\u201d solutions in cities, while effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart systems;\n- Learn about the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n- Understand the potential applications of the materials learned in this course, within the context of the management of \u201csmart urban transportation systems\u201d as well as \u201csmart urban energy systems\u201d.\n\nClass workload: 2 hours / week\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Smart Cities \u2013 Management of Smart Urban Infrastructures", "price": 0, "instructors": "Matthias Finger", "institution_name": ["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/smart-cities", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
