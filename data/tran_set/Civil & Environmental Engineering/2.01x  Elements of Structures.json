Join them and learn how to predict linear elastic behavior, and prevent structural failure, by relying on the notions of equilibrium, geometric compatibility, and constitutive material response.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "2.01x: Elements of Structures", "price": 0, "instructors": "Simona Socrate and Alexie M.
