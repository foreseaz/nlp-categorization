Students will have the opportunity to learn about acoustics and music theory through a mathematical lens. At the core of music are patterns, structures, and relationships that can be understood mathematically. The course will provide opportunities for students to play with and explore some of the concepts, including scales, the Fourier series, beats, rhythm, and harmonics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nWeek 1:\u00a0What is sound?
