The monumental symphony\u2019s size and complexity stretches traditional instrumental forms to the breaking point, and its famous choral finale changed our view of orchestral music forever.\n\nHarvard\u2019s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through all four movements of Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony, highlighting aspects of symphonic form, describing Beethoven\u2019s composition process, the rehearsals and premiere performance, and the work\u2019s continued relevance today.\n\nYou will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used and the circumstances of this symphony\u2019s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.\n\nAdditional First Nights Modules:First Nights: Handel\u2019s Messiah and Baroque Oratorio\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code.
