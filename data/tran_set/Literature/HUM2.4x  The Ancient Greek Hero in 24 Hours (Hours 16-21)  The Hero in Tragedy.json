The fourth of five modules in The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours, \u201cHours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy\u201d finds us in the world of high classical poetry in drama,\u00a0as brought to life\u00a0in three tragedies of Aeschylus, two of Sophocles, and two of Euripides. We see\u00a0here\u00a0the Greek hero as best known to us from the perspective of world\u00a0literature. The medium of drama makes\u00a0heroes seem more familiar to us, since we\u00a0think we know drama better than we know other verbal arts\u00a0such as epic and\u00a0lyric, but, by the time we finish analyzing the seven classical tragedies that\u00a0we will be\u00a0reading, we will see that the traditions of hero cult, infused into\u00a0the verbal art of drama, cast an altogether\u00a0new light on tragedy, defamiliarizing\u00a0for us not only the heroes illuminated by this art but also the art itself.\u00a0We\u00a0will see, then, maybe for the first time ever, that the ancient Greek hero of\u00a0tragedy was not at all like\u00a0us \u2013 even less like us than the hero of epic or\u00a0lyric. The male and female heroes of drama were larger than\u00a0life, far more so\u00a0than we may ever have imagined, reaching levels of both nobility and debasement\u00a0that\u00a0challenge our sense of equilibrium in the cosmos. As our close readings of\u00a0our seven chosen tragedies\u00a0will show, there was a disequilibrium in myths about\u00a0heroes in the remote past, and this disequilibrium\u00a0could be compensated only by\u00a0experiencing the equilibrium of rituals in the immediate present \u2013 rituals\u00a0culminating in the drama of heroic tragedy.\n\u00a0See other courses in this series:Module 1, \u201cHours 1-5: Epic and Lyric\u201dModule 2, \u201cHours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography\u201dModule 3, \u201cHours 12-15: Cult of Heroes\u201dModule 5, \u201cHours 22-24: Plato and Beyond\u201d\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.
