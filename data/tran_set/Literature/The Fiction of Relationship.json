Such connectedness can be not only emotional or erotic or political or environmental, but even textual, enacted through writing. In\nthis course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten\u00a0major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to the\npresent. These include: Manon Lescaut by Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost; two works by Herman Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener and Benito Cereno; Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre; two stories by Franz\nKafka, \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d and \u201cThe Country Doctor\u201d;\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse; William Faulkner\u2019s Light in August;\u00a0 an anthology of stories, Ficciones, by Jorge Luis\nBorges; The Ice Palace by Tarjei\nVesaas; Tony Morrison\u2019s Beloved; and Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this course will demonstrate, the most\ncritical relationships in our lives\u2014the linkages both known and unknown\u2014are\nnot always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on\nthese arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the\ncourse will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the\nworld and with others into clearer focus.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost, Manon Lescaut (1731)Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Jane Eyre (1847)Herman Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street (1853) and Benito Cereno (1855)Franz Kafka, \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d (1915) and \u201cA Country Doctor\u201d (1919)Virginia Woolf, To the Lighthouse (1927)William Faulkner, Light in August (1932)Jorge Luis Borges, Ficciones (1956)Tarjei Vesaas, The Ice Palace (1967)Toni Morrison, Beloved (1987)J.M.
