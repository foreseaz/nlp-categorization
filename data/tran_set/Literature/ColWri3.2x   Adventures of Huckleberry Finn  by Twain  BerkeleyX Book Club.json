This novel is among the first in major\u00a0American literature\u00a0to be written in\u00a0dialect, characterized by regional Southern English. While this makes the writing difficult to understand at first, it also gives us a window into the language of the time.\n\n\nThe story is noted for its colorful descriptions of people and places along the\u00a0Mississippi River. Set in the American South after the Civil War, this book features a society that has ceased to exist about twenty years prior.\u00a0The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u00a0is often described as a\u00a0satire\u00a0on deep-rooted attitudes, particularly racism, in the South.\n\u00a0\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\n\u00a0\nThis is the second part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "ColWri3.2x: \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" by Twain: BerkeleyX Book Club", "price": 0, "instructors": "Maggie Sokolik", "institution_name": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/adventures-huckleberry-finn-twain-uc-berkeleyx-colwri3-2x-0", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
