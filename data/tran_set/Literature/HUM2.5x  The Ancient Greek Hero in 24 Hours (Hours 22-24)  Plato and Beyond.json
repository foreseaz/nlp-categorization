The fifth and final module in The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours, \u201cHours 22-24: Plato and Beyond\u201d challenges the idea that Socrates was a hero, just as Plato\u2019s\u00a0Socrates himself challenges\u00a0that same idea. And yet, as we will see from reading Plato\u2019s\u00a0Apology of\u00a0Socrates\u00a0and\u00a0Phaedo, the idea of the hero is very\u00a0much present in Plato\u2019s works \u2013 just as it persists in\u00a0works beyond Plato,\u00a0whether or not these works adopt Plato\u2019s project of trying to substitute\u00a0philosophy for\u00a0literature (especially for poetry). Just as poetry serves as a\u00a0primary representative for the idea of the hero,\u00a0we will discover though our\u00a0close readings that the philosophical prose of Plato likewise represents this\u00a0same idea - though now the hero is no longer some superhuman human. Rather, the\u00a0real hero now\u00a0becomes the word of philosophical dialogue, which is brought back\u00a0to life much as a cult hero is brought\u00a0back to life ever time a heroic life is\u00a0narrated or dramatized. In Plato\u2019s works, the narration and the\u00a0dramatization\u00a0show not the life of the hero but the life of the word that survives the\u00a0speaker of the word,\u00a0provided that the word engages in dialogue \u2013 a\u00a0philosophical dialogue that contemplates the eternal truths\u00a0of the cosmos.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See other courses in this series:Module 1, \u201cHours 1-5: Epic and Lyric\u201dModule 2, \u201cHours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography\u201dModule 3, \u201cHours 12-15: Cult of Heroes\u201dModule 4, \u201cHours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy\u201d\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.
