The pleasure of actually saying a poem, or even saying it in your imagination\u2014your mind\u2019s ear\u2014is essential. That is a central idea of \u201cThe Art of Poetry,\u201d well demonstrated by the videos at favoritepoem.org: the photographer saying Sylvia Plath\u2019s \u201cNick and the Candlestick,\u201d the high school student saying Langston Hughes\u2019 \u201cMinstrel Man.\u201d Those readers base what they say about each poem upon their experience of saying it.\n\nThe course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense reading, requiring prolonged, thorough\u2014 in fact, repeated\u2014attention to specific poems.\n\nThe focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry\u2019s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry and difficulty; kidding and tribute\u2014with only incidental attention to \u201cschools,\u201d jargons, categories, and coteries.\n\nLearners are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one\u2019s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to Singing School: \u201cthis anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.\u201d In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "ARPO222x: The Art of Poetry", "price": 0, "instructors": "Robert Pinsky", "institution_name": ["Boston University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/art-poetry-bux-arpo222x-0", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
