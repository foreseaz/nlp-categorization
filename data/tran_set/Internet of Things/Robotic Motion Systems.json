In this class, you will learn about robotic motion systems for on-ground robots (chassis, wheels, bodies, arms, legs, head), flying machines (drones, fixed-wing, rotary systems), underwater and space-based systems.  \n\nWe'll explore the use of both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi (small, affordable single board computers) to design and develop these robotics and IOT devices. The course will explain how to integrate robotic motion systems with the onboard computer and optical systems to create fun new projects.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Robotic Motion Systems", "price": 0, "instructors": "Donn Silberman", "institution_name": ["University of California, Irvine"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/motionsystems", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
