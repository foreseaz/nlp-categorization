Could there be life elsewhere in the Universe? In this course we\u2019ll address those topics, as well as gaining some insight into how great scientific discoveries were made, and what's involved in scientific research.\r\nWe'll also look at the vital role that new technology plays in scientific discoveries. We'll talk to scientists about their role in the development of largest telescope in the history of astronomy: the Square Kilometre array.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nHow people over the ages have tried to understand the world around them\r\nHow we have developed our current picture of the Universe\r\nWhat the Universe looks like on different scales -\u00a0from the Earth and the Solar System right up to the largest-scale structure of the universe\r\nKey theories in astronomy and the key individuals behind them\r\nHow the universe has evolved and what new discoveries we are finding through the use of new technologies\r\nSome insight into the big questions we hope to find answers for, such as whether we are alone in the universe\r\n\r\nThis course requires approximately 2 - 4 hours of study per week, but can vary depending on the student.
