The cosmic microwave background. \u00a0Recent determination of cosmological parameters.\u00a0 Early universe physics.\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Astronomy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ronen Plesser", "institution_name": ["Duke University"], "commitment": "6-12 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/introastro", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
