Thoroughly understanding how capital markets work is therefore a necessity for anyone involved in any segment of the economy or simply willing to safely invest in capital markets. However, the variety and complexity of products and businesses as well as the use of a very specific jargon can make the mechanics of capital markets very confusing.\r\n\r\nThat is why this MOOC has four objectives:\r\nunderstanding the relationship between financial markets and the macroeconomy\r\nknowing how capital markets are organized and the roles of the main key players\r\ngrasping the mechanics of key financial products: stocks, bonds, options\r\nmaking informed investment decisions\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-03-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "WALL STREET MOOC: Understanding Financial Markets", "price": 0, "instructors": "Stephen L.
