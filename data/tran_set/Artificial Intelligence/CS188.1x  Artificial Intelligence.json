AI methods plan your driving directions, filter your spam, and focus your cameras on faces. AI lets you guide your phone with your voice and read foreign newspapers in English. Beyond today's applications, AI is at the core of many new technologies that will shape our future. From self-driving cars to household robots, advancements in AI help transform science fiction into real systems.\n\nThe course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. CS188.1x focuses on Behavior from Computation and will cover the following areas:\n\nStatistical and decision\u2013theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and in adversarial settings.\n\tReasoning and Learning. With this additional machinery your agents will be able to draw inferences in uncertain environments and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs.\n\tApplications for a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems. The techniques you learn in CS188x will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.\nJoin us today to learn more about how AI affects your life, and where it is headed in the future.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "CS188.1x: Artificial Intelligence", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dan Klein and Pieter Abbeel", "institution_name": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
