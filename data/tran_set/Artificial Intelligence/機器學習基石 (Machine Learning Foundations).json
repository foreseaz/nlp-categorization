The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on Coursera, while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the technical illustrations. We \nhope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more \nbeginners in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides will not require advanced English ability to understand, though. If you can understand the following descriptions of this course, you can probably follow the slides.

It is also a very dynamic field, where many new techniques are being designed every day, and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly. Thus, users of machine learning from other fields often face the problem of choosing or using the techniques properly. In this course, we emphasize the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a solid foundation, and enable him or her to exploit current techniques properly, explore further techniques and theories, or perhaps to contribute their own in the future.The course roughly corresponds to the first half-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine Learning\", and the second half-semester is on Coursera under the name \"Machine Learning Techniques.\" Based on five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including winning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan University) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the instructor chooses to focus on what he believes to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. The students shall enjoy a story-like flow moving from \"When Can Machines Learn\" to \"Why\", \"How\" and beyond. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Each of the following items correspond to approximately one hour of video lecture.
