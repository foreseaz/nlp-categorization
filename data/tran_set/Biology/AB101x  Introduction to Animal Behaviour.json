This biology and life sciences course provides an introduction to the complexities of wild animal behaviour, and how it is studied.\n\nOver six weeks, learners will explore the various behaviours animals adopt in order to meet the challenges of their daily lives. We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring.\n\nThis course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "AB101x: Introduction to Animal Behaviour", "price": 0, "instructors": "Prof. Marc Naguib and Dr. James Savage", "institution_name": ["Wageningen University"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-animal-behaviour-wageningenx-ab101x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
