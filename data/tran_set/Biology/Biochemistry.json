The course deals with an understanding of biological macromolecules: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. The structure and functional roles of the macromolecules will be studied in addition to fundamentals of enzyme chemistry: kinetics, mechanisms, inhibition, structure and mechanism. The course will also touch upon the basics of membrane transport and bioenergetic principles. After completion of the course, the students should be able to understand the chemical properties and three-dimensional structure of these biological macromolecules in relationship to their biological function.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1.
