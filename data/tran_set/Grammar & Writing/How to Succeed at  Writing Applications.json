We\u2019ll go on to help you examine your digital footprint and develop a professional profile online.\n\nThe course is highly participative and includes articles for you to read, videos to watch and interactive material to help you master the art of application and CV writing. There will also be discussions where you can learn from and support each other, self-reflective exercises and quizzes.
