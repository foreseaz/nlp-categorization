This course is not a series of independent lessons, but a deeper, more focused, unified look into the structure of English. Participants quickly discover that all English sentences follow the same principles by identifying the places contained in every sentence and the types of relationships and phrases found in those places. From day one, participants describe English sentences in a simple, straightforward manner and are able to apply this information for editing purposes. These skills facilitate the teaching and learning of other languages as well.\r\n\r\nCourse content is taken from linguistics and adapted to language teaching and learning. Course content is cumulative, applies directly to every sentence, and becomes the method for describing how words and phrases are combined into sentences to create meaning. X-words (traditionally called auxiliary verbs or helping verbs) are our keys for unlocking and revealing the hidden structure of every sentence.\"\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-12-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "X-word Grammar: The Simple Sentence", "price": 0, "instructors": "Richard Abend", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/x-word-grammar-sector-analysis", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
