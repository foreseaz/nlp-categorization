{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Web Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    In this course you will learn the fundamentals of back-end web development! You will create your own web application that queries a database for items on restaurant menus and then dynamically generates complete menus in the form of web pages and API endpoints.\n\nYou\u2019ll start by learning how to interact with a database from a web application using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer. From there, you\u2019ll learn how GET and POST requests translate to CRUD operations. You\u2019ll then explore the Flask framework and the various ways in which it can speed up the development of your applications. Finally, you\u2019ll develop your very own web application from the ground up using the iterative development process.Why Take This Course?Interacting with a persistent datastore is what transforms static web pages into powerful and effective web applications. Giving users the ability to create, read, update and delete data is the backbone of the most popular services on the Internet today. But, you must do so safely and securely - the smallest mistake could bring your application down or leak your user\u2019s data.\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll discover how all of the major components of web applications work and best practices in developing secure, data-driven web applications.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1 - Working with the CRUD \nIn the first lesson, you will learn about CRUD; Create, Read, Update, and Delete. You will learn why this acronym is important in web development and implement CRUD operations on a database. You will also learn to use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) as an alternative to SQL.\nLesson 2 - Making a Web Server\nIn the second lesson, you will build a web server from scratch using Python and some of the pre-installed libraries it includes. You will learn what GET and POST requests are and how we use them to retrieve and modify information on a web site. We will then use the concepts learned in Lesson 1 to add CRUD functionality to our website.\nLesson 3 - Developing with Frameworks\nIn the third lesson, we will discuss web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails. You will see how web frameworks simplify the development process and allow us to create web applications faster. We will use the Flask web framework to develop our own web application. We will also discuss API's (Application Programming Interfaces) and add JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) endpoints to our application to allow data to be sent in a format alternative to HTML. \nLesson 4 - Iterative Development\nIn the last lesson, you will build an entire web application on your own. You will learn about the iterative development process and how developing iteratively allows you to have a working prototype throughout all stages of the development process.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-02-22T00:00:00Z", "title": "Full Stack Foundations", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lorenzo Brown", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
