Do you find yourself copying and pasting lines of code over and over throughout your application? Surely there\u2019s a better way, right? \n\nYes, there is a better way -- object-oriented programming will allow you to build websites using reusable blocks of code known as libraries, similar to using bricks to build a house. This course is designed to teach web developers how to utilize the various object-oriented programming features within JavaScript, and more importantly, how to write reusable and maintainable libraries that will make your life easier.Why Take This Course?As a Front-End Web Developer, JavaScript is one of the most important languages in your toolbox. A strong foundation in the language\u2019s features empowers you to write efficient and performant web applications. In this course you\u2019ll explore a variety of ways to write object-oriented code in JavaScript.\n\nYou\u2019ll build a variety of JavaScript objects and explore how their different inheritance models affect your code\u2019s execution and in-memory model. You\u2019ll use these features to write memory efficient code and seek simplicity and modularity in your own code.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Scopes and Closures\nWe\u2019ll start by discussing JavaScript\u2019s functional variable scoping features, including lexical scopes (variable availability as you write your code) and dynamics scopes (variable availability as your code actively runs). We\u2019ll then discuss closures, an often misunderstood but incredibly useful feature available in only a handful of languages, including JavaScript.\n\n### Lesson 2: The Keyword \u201cthis\u201d\nYou\u2019ll start your dive into JavaScript object-oriented features by first discovering the parameter \u201cthis\u201d. You\u2019ll learn how the value of \u201cthis\u201d is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of \u201cthis\u201d as a parameter rather than a keyword.\n\n### Lesson 3: Prototype Delegation\nYou\u2019re probably using one of JavaScript\u2019s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your application\u2019s memory footprint.\n\n### Lesson 4: Code Reuse\nThere are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and you\u2019ll practice a number of them in this lesson. We\u2019ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, we\u2019ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models. Finally, we\u2019ll explore sub-classing -- coding objects that directly inherit from objects we\u2019ve previously defined.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-10-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "Object-Oriented JavaScript", "price": 0, "instructors": "Marcus Phillips", "institution_name": ["Hack Reactor"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2014-09-25T00:00:00Z"}
