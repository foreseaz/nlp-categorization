Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    fsi-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    What is \u00a0fluid-solid interactions\u00a0 ?\u00a0 It\nis what happens when the \u00a0motions of a\nfluid and of a solid are somehow coupled.

There are so many phenomena and so many models \u00a0that\u00a0 we\n\u00a0\u00a0need to work together on the basic\nmechanisms .
