These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style.\u00a0\nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called\nNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July\n14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed\nusing classical mechanics, and nothing\nmore.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\nWeek 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  1D motion: speed, velocity and acceleration\n\nWeek 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1D motion continued.\u00a0\u00a0\nVector Math.\n\nWeek 3: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Motion in 2D.\n\nWeek 4: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newton\u2019s Laws.\n\nWeek 5: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Applications of Newton\u2019s Laws.\u00a0 Friction.\n\nWeek 6: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work and Energy.\n\nWeek 7: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Energy. \n\nWeek 8: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gravity and orbits.\n\nWeek 9:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Momentum and Collisions.\n\nWeek 10: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rotational Motion.\n\nWeek 11: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conservation of Angular Momentum.\u00a0 Static Equilibrium.\n\nWeek 12: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple Harmonic Motion.\n\n \n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Physics 1 for Physical Science Majors", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Dubson", "institution_name": ["University of Colorado Boulder"], "commitment": "8-12 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/physics1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
