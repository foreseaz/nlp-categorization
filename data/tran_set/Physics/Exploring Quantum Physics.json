What Feynman was referring to are some of the \u201cspooky\u201d phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory. Quantum physics combines\na spectacular record of discovery and predictive success, with foundational\nperplexities so severe that even Albert Einstein came to believe that it was\nwrong.\u00a0 This is what makes it such an\nexciting area of science!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lecture 1: Introduction to quantum mechanics.
