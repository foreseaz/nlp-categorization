At the same time, those who\n        cherry-pick selected course elements (e.g., learning the basics of video\n        capture and analysis of motion in one\u2019s own surroundings) will still advance\n        their understanding of physics. \u00a0\u00a0\n        \n    \n    We aim to understand and to predict motion in the real world using a small\n        set of powerful fundamental principles. The laboratories are the backbone\n        of this course, providing opportunities (1) to observe and to analyze motion\n        in our own surroundings, (2) to apply fundamental principles to build explanations\n        of the motion, and (3) to evaluate, in a constructively critical way, our\n        own measurements and models, as well as the measurements and models of\n        our course peers. Other course elements (lecture videos with \u201cclicker\u201d\n        questions, homework) support and extend the physics explored in the laboratories.Participants\n    who satisfactorily complete the course will be eligible for six (6) Continuing\n    Education Units from the American Association of Physics Teachers.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        (NB:\u00a0 This syllabus will be revised soon to reflect a 16-week term; please check back later.\u00a0 )\n    \n\nWeek 1: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Motion in 1D: Kinematics, Vectors (Part 1) &amp; Newton\u2019s 2nd Law\nLab 0:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Install Video Analysis &amp; Computer Modeling Software\n\n\nWeek 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n    Motion in 1D: Prediction of Motion; Constant/Non-Constant Forces\nLab 1:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Constant Velocity Motion in Your Surroundings\n\n\nWeek 3: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Motion in &gt; 1D: Vectors (Part 2) &amp; Newton\u2019s 2nd Law\nWeek 4: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n    Motion in &gt; 1D: Prediction of Motion; Momentum\nLab 2:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Free Fallin\u2019 with Drag (1D Dynamics)\n\n\nWeek 5: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Curving Motion, Including Uniform/Non-Uniform Circular Motion\nWeek 6: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Energy Principle; Work\nLab 3:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Galactic Black Holes (&gt;1D Dynamics)\n\n\nWeek 7: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Multiparticle Systems: Potential Energy\nWeek 8: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Energy Applications\nLab 4:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rope Physics in Sports (Forces &amp; Energy)\n\n\nWeek 9: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Energy &amp; Momentum: Collisions\nWeek 10: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n    Angular Momentum Principle\nLab 5:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Free Choice Project (Energy &amp; Momentum)\n\nWeek 11: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFinal Exam; Lab 5 Submit &amp; Evaluate\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introductory Physics I with Laboratory", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael F.
