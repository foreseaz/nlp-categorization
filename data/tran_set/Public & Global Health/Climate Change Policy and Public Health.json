This course explores the impact of human activities on climate change\nand consequently public health, as well as the many real benefits to climate\nchange mitigation. We will discover the multiple benefits \u2013 or co-benefits \u2013 provided by public\npolicies and initiatives to reduce emissions. For example, protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse\ngases can simultaneously improve human health.In addition to providing evidence for climate change\u2019s impact on human\nhealth, this course will explore three primary areas where co-benefits can be realized: renewable energy, agriculture and\nfood, urban design and active transport. Please note: use of the term \u201curban\u201d\nis relative; traits traditionally understood as \u201curban\u201d can exist in many\nplaces, even if populations are not large.This course will feature input from experts across the globe.\nParticipants will have the opportunity to engage with the current scientific\nand political literature, and discuss course content with peers worldwide. Course participants will be given a strong foundation in the core\nlinkages between climate change, policy, and health. There will also be\nhands-on opportunities to develop skills in communicating the science and\npolicy connections between climate change and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course will emphasize a way forward for all, one providing the most\nbeneficial effects on both human health and the environment.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Week\n1 will explore crucial background information for this course, including the\nscientific consensus on climate change and its known impacts on health.\u00a0 Students will also review the Lima Decision,\nwhere at the 20th Conference of the Parties held in Lima, health concerns were\nexplicitly mentions for the first time as a requirement for countries to\nconsider in their formal policy planning for climate change mitigation and\nadaptation. \n\nWeek 2: Week\n2 will cover the health \u201cCo-Benefits\u201d of renewable energy and\u00a0 efficient housing, with a detailed look at\nhow burning fossil fuels impacts air pollution and health.\u00a0 Students will also explore air quality\nlegislation in India.\u00a0 \n\nWeek 3: Week\n3 will focus on the health \u201cco-benefits\u201d of sustainable agriculture, and\nintroduce students to some missed opportunities in agriculture policy.\u00a0 Students will review the US-Farm Bill, one of\nthe most influential pieces of legislation controlling land management in the\nUnited States. \n\nWeek 4: The final week of the course will feature the health\n\u201cco-benefits\u201d of active transportation and smart urban design.\u00a0 Students will evaluate Sweden\u2019s \u201cVision Zero\u201d\ninitiative and consider polices that support active transportation and reduced\nreliance on fossil fuels.\u00a0\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Climate Change Policy and Public Health", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jonathan Patz", "institution_name": ["University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"], "commitment": "4-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/ccandph", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
