This course will provide students with a heightened awareness and\nunderstanding of the natural and man-made hazards that create disaster events. Each topic in the course is presented by a leader and subject matter expert, allowing students to learn from some of the most highly-recognized stakeholders in disaster preparedness.\u00a0Course\ncontent is designed to assist health care providers and students in acquiring cutting-edge, evidence-based disaster knowledge and skills in order to respond in a timely\nand appropriate manner and ultimately to increase hospital surge capacity.\u00a0We\nstart by presenting an overview of the foundational concepts underlying\ndisaster preparedness with a focus on understanding individual health care\nprovider roles and responsibilities within our existing emergency response\nsystems as well as for personal and family preparedness.\nNext, we consider all components of a well-designed hospital preparedness\nprogram including redundant communications and situational awareness, the role\nof the health care provider in disaster operations and logistics, and education\nand training for workforce development. Finally, we cover the roles and\nresponsibilities of health care providers in response to specific disaster and\npublic health emergency events resulting from acts of terrorism, pandemic\ninfluenza and emerging highly infectious disease, chemical, biological and\nradiological emergencies, and natural disasters.\u00a0In this six-week course, health care providers will acquire foundational knowledge in the health care\nmanagement of victims of natural and man-made disasters and new strategies for\nincreasing hospital surge capacity. Utilizing course exercises, case studies, and\nonline discussions, students will have the opportunity to identify strategies\nand expert practices in the care of victims of disasters and public health\nemergencies.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK 1: Disaster Preparedness: OverviewBasic Foundational Concepts of Disaster PreparednessIncident Command System and Leadership at the Unit LevelDisaster Communication and Situational AwarenessEstablishing Personal and Family PreparednessUnited States Federal Disaster ResourcesWEEK 2: Hospital-Based ReadinessHospital Preparedness OverviewCreating Surge Capacity (Lifeboat Ethics)Disaster and Mass Casualty TriageWorkforce Readiness and Willingness to RespondDisaster DrillsWEEK 3: Terrorism\u00a0Active Shooter and Dangerous PersonsTerrorism, Bomb Threats, and Other Internal ThreatsBurn Casualty ManagementBomb and Blast Injury ManagementWEEK 4: Chemical and Radiation EventsChemical EmergenciesRadiation Emergency Management OverviewResponding to Radiation EventsUse of Personal Protective EquipmentDecontaminationWEEK 5: Pandemic Influenza and Emerging InfectionsSeasonal and Pandemic Influenza\u00a0Responding to Emerging Infectious Disease OutbreaksDisease Containment StrategiesProtective Equipment for Safety During Infectious Disease OutbreaksWEEK 6: Natural DisastersPlanning for Natural DisastersActivation of the Hospital EOC in Response to Natural DisastersMorbidity and Mortality Related to Natural DisastersAdvancing the Science: Current Research EffortsQ and A \u00a0\"Ask Us Anything\"\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-22T00:00:00Z", "title": "Disaster Preparedness for the Health Care Professional", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tener Veenema", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/disasterpreparedness", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
