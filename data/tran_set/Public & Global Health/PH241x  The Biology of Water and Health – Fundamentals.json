You will explore the multi-faceted ways in which water and human health are interrelated, including the influence of waterborne pathogens on public health and the central role of water quantity and quality in preserving health through adequate sanitation and hygiene. You will be introduced to a brief history of U.S. water distribution, waterborne disease cases, epidemiological approaches to public health engineering, and historical evidence of lead (Pb) as a water contaminant.\n\nWe hope that the unique interdisciplinary approach of this course gives the general public, as well as health professionals in a variety of fields, a provocative introduction to the public health and human engineering components involved in the provision of safe water and sanitation.\n\nSign up for\u00a0The Biology of Water and Health \u2013 Sustainable Interventions\u00a0(PH242x) to further expand your knowledge and professional network related to water sustainability. Starts on September 29, 2015.\u00a0\n\nTufts University is proud to offer the two Biology of Water and Health courses (PH241x &amp; PH242x) in partnership with the Open Education Consortium (OECx).
