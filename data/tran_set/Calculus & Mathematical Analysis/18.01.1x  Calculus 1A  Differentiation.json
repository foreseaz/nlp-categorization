The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative.\u00a0\n\nBut what is the derivative?\u00a0 You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative.\u00a0 You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions.\u00a0 You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior.\u00a0 You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\nCalculus 1B: Integration\n\nCalculus 1C: Coordinate Systems &amp; Infinite Series\n\nThis course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.\n\n*Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\nThis is a past/archived course.
