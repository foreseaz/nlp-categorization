We will explore a number of topics within nanoelectronics, taking a more in depth look at quantum transport, gaining greater insight into the application of the Schrodinger Equation, and learning the basics of spintronics.\n\n\u201cThe course was just awesome!\u201d\n\n- Student from Part A\n\nThis course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and the National Science Foundation with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "nano521x: Fundamentals of Nanoelectronics, Part B: Quantum Transport", "price": 0, "instructors": "Supriyo Datta", "institution_name": ["Purdue University"], "commitment": "5-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-nanoelectronics-part-b-purduex-nano521x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
