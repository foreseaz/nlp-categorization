The future holds even greater potential for this technology, with an entirely new generation of ultralow-cost, lightweight and even flexible electronic devices, which will perform functions traditionally accomplished with much more expensive components based on conventional semiconductor materials, such as silicon.\n\nLearn more about this highly promising technology, which is based on small molecules and polymers, and how these materials can be implemented successfully in established (e.g., organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices) and emerging (e.g., thermoelectric (TE) generators) organic electronic modules.\n\nIn this course you will gain the ability to tie molecular transport phenomena with macroscopic device response such that you will be well-prepared to analyze, troubleshoot, and design the next generation of organic electronic materials and devices.\n\u00a0\nThis course has short lectures with quizzes, homework, and exams.\n\nThis course is the latest nanoHUB-U project in a series offered is jointly funded by Purdue University and the NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines though short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-04-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "nano515x: Organic Electronic Devices", "price": 0, "instructors": "Bryan Boudouris", "institution_name": ["Purdue University"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/organic-electronic-devices-purduex-nano515x", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
