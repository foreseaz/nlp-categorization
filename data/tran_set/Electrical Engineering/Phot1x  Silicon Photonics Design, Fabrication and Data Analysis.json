We will measure your designs using an automated optical probe station and provide you the data. You will then analyze your experimental data.\n\nWhy take this course?\n\nTo get hands on design experience with integrated optics\n\tTo learn how to use advanced optical design tools\n\tTo get your design fabricated, and obtain experimental data\nThe focus of this course is a design project, guided by lectures, tutorials and activities.\u00a0As a first-time designer, you will design an interferometer, which is a widely used device in many applications such as communications (modulation, switching) and sensing.\u00a0Specifically, it is Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, consisting of fibre grating couplers, two splitters, and optical waveguides.\u00a0For advanced designers, this course is an opportunity to design many other devices, such as directional couplers, ring, racetrack and disk resonators, Bragg gratings including grating assisted contra-directional couplers, photonic crystals, multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers, polarization diversity components, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) components and circuits, novel waveguides such as sub-wavelength grating (SWG) and metamaterial waveguides, slot waveguides, etc.\n\nCommercial software tool licenses are provided in this course (Lumerical Solutions, Mentor Graphics, and MATLAB).\u00a0Open-source alternatives are provided.\u00a0Mentor Graphics tools are accessed remotely via a cloud service; the others can be run on your own computer.\n\nYou will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow much effort is required?\n\nSince this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required.\n\nWhat are the prerequisites for taking this course?\n\nPhot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python).\n\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\n\nThe notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course.\u00a0The textbook is optional.\u00a0Included in the course are several key chapters from the book \"Silicon Photonics Design\", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459.\n\nWhat are the fabrication details?\u00a0\n\nYour devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm.\u00a0Each participant is allocated 410 \u00b5m x 605 \u00b5m of space, enough for &gt;10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants.\u00a0\n\nWho will be doing the fabrication and measurements?\n\nThe fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia.\n\nWill I be getting a physical chip in the mail?\n\nNo. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants.\n\nAre there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail?\n\nYes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out.\u00a0We typically do fabrication runs every two months.\u00a0Additional options for \u00a0obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course.\n\nDo you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x?\n\nYes.\u00a0We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging.\u00a0All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries.\u00a0More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca.\u00a0Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z", "title": "Phot1x: Silicon Photonics Design, Fabrication and Data Analysis", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lukas Chrostowski", "institution_name": ["The University of British Columbia"], "commitment": "3-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-ubcx-phot1x-1", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
