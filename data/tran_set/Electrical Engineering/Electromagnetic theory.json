The course covers static and dynamic electric and magnetic fields and their interaction. Major topics include Electromagnetic Waves, Transmission Lines, Waveguides, and Antenna fundamentals. In addition, quasi-static analysis and numerical methods are also discussed. Successful completion of the course will allow students to take up Microwave Engg, Antennas, and Optics for future studies.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Coulomb's law and electric fieldsWeek 2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Gauss's law, potential and energy, conductors and dielectricsWeek 3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Laplace and Poisson equations, solution methods, and capacitanceWeek 4\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Biot-Savart and Ampere's laws, inductance calculationWeek 5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Magnetic materials, Faraday's law and quasi-static analysisWeek 6\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Maxwell equations and uniform plane wavesWeek 7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Wave propagation in dielectrics and conductors, skin effect, normal incidenceWeek 8\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Oblique incidence, Snell's law, and total internal reflectionWeek 9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Transmission lines, Smith chart, impedance matchingWeek 10\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Transients and pulse propagation on transmission lineWeek 11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Waveguides: Metallic and DielectricWeek 12\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Antenna fundamentals\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Electromagnetic theory", "price": 0, "instructors": "Pradeep Kumar", "institution_name": ["IIT (Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur)"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_ee01", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2016-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
