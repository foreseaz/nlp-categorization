We then move on to explore your attitude to financial management and whether you have bad financial habits and how these should be addressed.\n\nWe introduce a simple four-stage model for making financial decisions before moving on to examine the two components of household budgeting – income and expenditure. In doing this we learn about the impact of inflation and taxation on incomes and the support to households provided by the state benefit system.\n\nIn examining expenditure we look at the pressures placed on us to spend our money, how to shop with confidence on the internet and on how ‘heuristics’ can interfere with good spending decision-making.\n\nThe course finishes by looking at a key area of household spending: insurance. We examine when to insure and when to bear the risks yourself without buying an insurance policy. We use the financial planning model, introduced at the start of the course, to make good decisions when buying insurance.\n\nThis facilitated 4-week course is up-to-date and uses an array of audio-visual assets to help you through the subject matter.\n\nDevelop fundamental business and finance skills\n\nThis course has been developed by The Open University Business School – a pioneering institution that is triple accredited by AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB.\n\nIt is one of eight from The Open University, designed to help you gain fundamental business and financial skills, including communication, networking, relationship building, project management, personal financial planning and management, investment and financial services.\n\nYou can complete this course as part of one of these two programs:\n\nFinance Fundamentals: four courses, which will give you valuable skills to manage finances at home and at work, and enable you to earn a FutureLearn Award.\n\nBusiness and Finance Fundamentals: eight courses; holders of FutureLearn Certificates of Achievement for all eight courses can earn 30 UK credits towards The Open University Business School’s BA in Business Management by passing a linked Open University assessment module (requiring separate OU registration and fee).\n\nFor further information about registration, the final assessment course and the BA in Business Management, visit the Open University website.\n\nThe True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance (True Potential PUFin)\n\nThis course has been adapted from original material created by The Open University’s True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance, and was made possible thanks to the generous support of True Potential LLP.\n\n\n                                    ",
