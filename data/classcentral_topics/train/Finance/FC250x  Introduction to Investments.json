Beginning with introductory finance notions of risk and return, we examine qualitative concepts such as market efficiency and valuation.\n\nThese tools should enable you to build valuation models for common stocks. Through this process, you will also learn how professional financial analysts should evaluate companies. The course is suitable for students seeking eventual employment with a brokerage company, investment company or financial services company with responsibilities in evaluating and selecting equity securities for investment portfolios.\n\n                                    ",
