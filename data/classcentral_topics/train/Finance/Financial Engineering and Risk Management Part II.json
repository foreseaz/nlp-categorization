The emphasis of FE &amp; RM Part II will be on the use of simple stochastic models to (i) solve portfolio optimization problems  (ii) price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities and credit and (iii) consider some advanced applications of financial engineering including algorithmic trading and the pricing of real options. We will also consider the role that financial engineering played during the financial crisis. \n\nWe hope that students who complete the course and the prerequisite course (FE &amp; RM Part I) will have a good understanding of the \"rocket science\" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Mean-Variance Analysis and CAPMProblem formulation and solution; the efficient frontier; including the risk-free asset; the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM);implications of CAPM: α, β, security and capital market linesPractical Issues in Implementing Mean VarianceProblems with mean-variance analysis; ETFs and leveraged ETFs; VaR and CVaR for asset allocation; survivorship bias, performance evaluation and other statistical pitfalls.Equity Derivatives in Practice: Part IProblems with mean-variance analysis; ETFs and leveraged ETFs; VaR and CVaR for asset allocation; survivorship bias, performance evaluation and other statistical pitfalls.Equity Derivatives in Practice: Part IIMore about Black-Scholes, the Greeks and delta-hedging; the volatility surface; pricing derivatives using the volatility surface; model calibration.Credit Derivatives and Structured ProductsMechanics and pricing of CDOs; exotic structured credit securities including CDO-squared’s and CDO-cubed’s.
