Chapter 2: Time Value of Money - ApplicationsIn this chapter, we build on Chapter 1 and move quickly to more advanced applications of TVM focusing on situations we confront on a daily basis.Chapter 3: Decision CriteriaIn this chapter, we develop an understanding of alternative decision criteria - Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Profitability, etc. - that are commonly used in the real world, with a focus on a critical evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses.Chapter 4: Decision Making &amp; Cash FlowsThis chapter contains a basic introduction to the key determinants of cash flows using accounting principles. Chapter 5: Bond ValuationThis chapter introduces you to the most common vehicle of investment/financing: bonds.  Though introductory, we attempt to cover a fair amount of content and with real world applications.Chapter 6: Stock ValuationThis chapter provides an exposure to the characteristics and the valuation of stocks, again with an eye toward real world applications.Chapter 7: What is Risk?In this chapter, we will develop a theory of risk based on the intuitive concept of diversification. Since knowledge of Statistics is key to understanding risk, we will introduce some important concepts of applications.Chapter 8: Diversification and CAPMIn this chapter, we will introduce one of the most widely known models called CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model), which provides a simple and powerful relation between risk and return.Chapter 9: Leverage, WACC &amp; ValuationThis Chapter attempts to put together a cash flows and risk and return in a world with leverage financing. The content is our first exposure to valuation with a full-blown application.\n                                    ",
