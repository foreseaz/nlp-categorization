This generation is active, conscious – if not passionate – about their lifestyle choices, pro-active in addressing their health issues, and oftentimes financially stretched. This initiative will create a novel educational resource that will provide information and advice on the most important issues Baby Boomerse face.As part of the project, we will be producing a series of symposia in addition to a sequence of university online courses addressing Aging, the Baby Boomers and Retirement (with lessons for younger generations). The online courses will draw from the content discussed and debated during the symposia series to be co-hosted by The George Washington University and a consortium of university and academic partners during 2015 and 2016. Symposia are planned to begin Fall/Winter, 2015\"\n\n                                    ",
