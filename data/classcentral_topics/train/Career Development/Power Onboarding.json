Students will prepare a custom, actionable personal onboarding plan that will set them up for success in their new role.\n\nResearch has shown that an actively followed power onboarding plan will allow an individual to reach proficiency in their new position up to 30% faster than the typical transitioning manager. In this course, students will develop their own personal onboarding plan, allowing them to contribute sooner and be eligible for promotion earlier. What’s more, the company has the benefit of your value added sooner.\n\nIn this newly revised format, learners can complete Power Onboarding in 3.5 to 4 hours. We have a suggested 4 week schedule to help you stay on the track, but we understand that everyone has different learning styles so we've made this course flexible enough so that you can complete the entire course in one or two sittings.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 - Get ReadyWelcome to Power Onboarding!
