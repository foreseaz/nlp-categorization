The ePortfolios allow users to create and manage a space in which evidence of the competencies and skills acquired over a period of time are collected. Thus, the ePortfolios can be adapted to different purposes, either to improve teaching methods and traditional learning, record personal achievements, accreditation of prior learning, manage Personal Development Plans (PDP) or Continuing Professional Development , etc.\r\nThe MOOC is aimed at students, teachers, professionals, educational institutions, employers, organizations and / or policy makers interested in using ePortfolios for the first time or who want to improve and expand their current practices. The MOOC provides an entry point for non-experts, providing conceptual and instrumental knowledge necessary to develop an ePortfolio to suit individual or organizational goals.\n\n                                    ",
