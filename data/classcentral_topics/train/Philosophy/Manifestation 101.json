Manifestation can be described as the process of when something \"unreal\" becomes \"real\" and tangibly experienced in reality. Every human on the planet - that means You! - has the ability to manifest their dreams and desires into physical reality. We will cover the scientific and spiritual theories behind the Law of Attraction, learn how to process fears and firewalls that often prevent us from effectively manifesting our dreams, and cover best practices and techniques that you can continue to use after this course has completed. The goal of this course is to help you step into your own power and enable you to create the life that you have always dreamed of living.  This course is designed to teach both spiritual novices and experts alike the basic tools to spiritual and physical manifestation. By the end of this course, you will have the tools necessary to leverage the \"law of attraction\" and manifest your desires into your every day life. If you're already a spiritual expert, these tools can be easily integrated into your rituals and practices. If you're a spiritual novice, you'll see a structured and practical approach to manifestation techniques that you can use at the level you are comfortable with. If you've ever wanted to make your dreams come true, this course will help serve as your guide to the practice of manifestation.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Journey into ManifestationThis module will introduce to the fundamentals to human manifestation. Many individuals are interested in various areas of manifestation in their lives. Some of them might want things to do with their career, others with regards to money and wealth and material well being in general - so other things such as income, houses, transport, environmental well being in their own lives- that type of thing. Others have come in very strongly with spiritual manifestation or evolutionary manifestation â€“ what they want to achieve as a person in a very soul or spiritual level. This module will cover the origins of manifestation.\n                                    ",
