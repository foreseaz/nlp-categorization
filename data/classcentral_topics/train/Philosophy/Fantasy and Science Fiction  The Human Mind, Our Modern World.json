The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and\noften shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale\nto kiddie lit to myth; from \"Cinderella\" to Alice in Wonderland to Superman;\nfrom building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole\nsocieties. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent\nneeds and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself\nin many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy\ngodmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical\nviewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction,\nfrom Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern\nworld because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound\nways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind,\nshape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will\nexplore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art\nand as insights into ourselves and our world.\n\n\n\nWork Expectations\nFor further information about the coursework, please see the  Work Expectations page.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course comprises ten units.
