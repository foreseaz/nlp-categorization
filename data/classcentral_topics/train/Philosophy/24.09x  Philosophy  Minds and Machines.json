Can there be a science of consciousness?\n\nThis course explores these questions and others. It is a thorough, rigorous introduction to contemporary philosophy of mind.\n\nAccording to many scientists and philosophers, explaining the nature of consciousness is the deepest intellectual challenge of all. If you find consciousness at all puzzling, this is a great place to start learning more.\n\n                                    ",
