This course investigates the complex ways in which the Great War mobilized philosophical reflection during the war and the varied ways in which philosophical thought responded to the war.\n\nStudents in this course will be introduced to different philosophical reactions to the Great War  through discussion and analysis of texts, documents, images, artworks, film, and music. The relation between philosophy and poetry will also be explored. In this course, students will gain historical knowledge, conceptual understanding, and literacy for a clearer grasp of the complex ways in which philosophy and the Great War intersected.\n\nThe course is divided into four thematic sections:\n\nAn Absolute War\n\tThe Clash of Civilizations\n\tMemento Mori\n\tThe Hope of Peace\nAcross each of these thematic sections, we will explore a panoramic view of different philosophical traditions and movements in England, France, and Germany during the war.\n\nStudents have the option to participate in forum discussions in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Chinese.\n\n                                    ",
