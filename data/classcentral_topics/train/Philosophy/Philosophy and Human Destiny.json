What can we hope for in this life, or (if there is one) the next? In this course we will consider and critically examine a variety of different answers to these questions, both Religious and Secular, from both the East and the West. We will examine accounts of human nature and destiny as presented in the writings of philosophers, theologians and authors whose works explore the fundamental meaning of our individual lives and the destiny of the human species.\n\n                                    ",
