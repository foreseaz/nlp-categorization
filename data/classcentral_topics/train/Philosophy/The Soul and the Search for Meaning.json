Across the rise and fall of civilizations, the emergence of science and reason from the Dark Ages, and our quest to explore our realm, over land and ocean and into the very stars themselves, we are driven by a need to understand who we are, where we come from, and how we got to where we are today. Join renowned historian and educator Dr. Stephen Ruzicka in the Soul and the Search for Meaning, a fascinating journey across time, myth and legend, as we explore the spiritual and philosophical origins of the most powerful species in known existence: ourselves.\n\n                                    ",
