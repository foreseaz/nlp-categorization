Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    linearopt-001\n                                                                    linearopt-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This\n course serves as an introduction to linear and discrete \noptimization from the viewpoint of a mathematician or computer \nscientist.  Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on \nunderstanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically \nrigorous way. We will answer  questions like:Does a particular method work correctly?Does it terminate and, if yes, in what time?Can we prove that a solution is optimal?The\n course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be \napplied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of \nduality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows. The\n course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization \nthat is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at \nEPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, \nand a final exam. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Linear programming, modeling, equivalence of standard forms Basic solutions, primal and dual feasible basic solutions, pivoting and the simplex methodTermination and complexity of the simplex method Integer programming, bipartite matching and flowsModels of computation, bit-complexity\n                                    ",
