Efficient data structures are key for designing efficient algorithms and obtaining maintainable software design.\n\nIn this Computer Science course, you will start by learning basic data types, such as numbers, and gradually build a conceptual framework for organizing and managing efficient structures.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nBasic Data Types, Notion of an Abstract Data Type\n\tMathematical Properties of Sequences\n\tSpecial Types of Sequences: Stacks, Queues, Strings\n\tImplementation of Sequence Type: Arrays and Linked Lists\n\tTrees\n\tSets and Maps\n\tGraphs\nPreliminary understanding of implementing sequence structures such as stacks, queues, and linked lists, will also be covered.\n\nThis course is part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science XSeries Program:Â \n\nProgramming Basics\n\tObject-Oriented Programming\n\tImplementation of Data Structures\n\tAlgorithms\n\n\n                                    ",
