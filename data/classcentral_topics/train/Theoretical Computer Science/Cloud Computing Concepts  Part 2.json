Learn about such fundamental distributed computing \"concepts\" for cloud computing.\n\nSome of these concepts include: Clouds, MapReduce, key-value stores, Classical precursors, Widely-used algorithms, Classical algorithms, Scalability, Trending areas, And more!\n\nUnderstand how these techniques work inside today’s most widely-used cloud computing systems. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the optional programming track, implement some of these concepts in template assignments provided in C++ programming language.\n\nYou will also watch interviews with leading managers and researchers, from both industry and academia.\n\n                                    ",
