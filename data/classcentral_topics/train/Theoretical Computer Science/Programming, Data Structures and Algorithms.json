The learner is assumed to have no prior experience of programming, but is expected to be at the level of a second year undergraduate college student in science or engineering. The course will run over ten weeks with about 2-3 hours of lectures per week.\r\nAt the end of each week, the learner is expected to write some programs and submit them for grading. These programming problems are classified as easy, moderate or difficult. The easy problems, typically, are repeats from the lecture. The moderate and difficult ones will require increasing levels of initiative from the learner. In addition, at the end of each week the learner is expected to answer a set of objective-type assessment questions. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nIntroduction to Computers and Programming\r\nWriting your first program\r\nVariables and operators and expressions\r\nVariable declarations, more operators, precedence\r\nInput, Output Statements\r\nConditionals\r\nLoops\r\nArrays and Multidimensional arrays\r\nPointers\r\nFunctions\r\nRunning time of a program\r\nComputing time complexity\r\nPolynomial evaluation and multiplication\r\nSearching: Linear and Binary\r\nFinding minimum and maximum\r\nSorting I: Insertion, Merge\r\nSorting II: Counting, Radix\r\nFinding i-th smallest number\r\nStructures and User-defined data types\r\nBrief introduction to C++: Classes and objects\r\nData Structures: Abstract Data Type\r\nLists\r\nStacks: Last In First Out\r\nQueues: First In First Out\r\nTrees\r\nTree traversal\r\nHeaps\r\nGraphs and Representation\r\nGreedy algorithms\r\nDynamic programming\r\nMatrix Chain Multiplication\r\nDijkstra's Algorithm\r\nStrings\r\nBoyer-Moore String Matching Algorithm\r\nFile I/O\r\nModular Programming\r\n\n                                    ",
