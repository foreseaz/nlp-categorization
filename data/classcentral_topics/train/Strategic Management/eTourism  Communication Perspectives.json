We are embarking to create a great study experience, which explores how Information and Communication Technologies do matter for tourism – both for our personal experience, and for the tourism industry at large. In other words, we will together explore eTourism by using tools and models from the Communication Sciences.Key concepts and theories covered include: Online Communication Model; Roman Jakobson's Communication Model; Quality of online contents; User Generated Content; Web 2.0; Reputation in online Media; Intercultural Communication and Localization; eLearning; Argumentation; World Heritage Sites.\n\n                                    ",
