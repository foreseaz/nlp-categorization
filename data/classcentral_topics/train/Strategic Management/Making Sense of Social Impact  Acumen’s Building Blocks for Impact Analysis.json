Is it just the number of lives impacted? How do we know if the goods and services our companies provide are improving lives? When do social and financial goals coincide, and when do they deviate? These questions are core to our work to create a world beyond poverty.\r\nTogether with Acumen’s Impact Team, we’ve developed this introductory course to help you understand how we analyze impact in our portfolio and how you can apply the same building blocks to any socially-focused company or organization that you are personally excited about.\r\nWe believe this course will be especially insightful for those interested in impact investing, but it is by no means limited to that audience. Whether you are a philanthropist, an individual working at a non-profit, an impact investor or an social entrepreneur, or if you just want to understand what it might take for you to “do good” more effectively, this course is for you.\r\nThe world needs you to lead.\n\n                                    ",
