The combined effects of globalization, technologization and changing priorities have led to an awareness of the fact that we cannot keep consuming and developing at the expense of the environment, social commitments and our inner values (Ellis, 2010)This course is about CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) in new market conditions and focuses on business development. It will include some basics about CSR in a business context and will be structured around different classic business disciplines seen from the CSR perspective.Several other terminologies like sustainability, green economy, circular economy etc. are used depending on the approach to this type of business development. There will be some clarification and discussion of these different terminologies throughout the course.\n\n                                    ",
