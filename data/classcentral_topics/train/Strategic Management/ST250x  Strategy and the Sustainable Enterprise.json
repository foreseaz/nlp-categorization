Why has it captured so much attention from academics as well as corporate leaders? How can businesses manage emerging sustainability challenges without compromising their core advantages, and transform themselves into 'sustainable enterprises'?\n\nThis course explores the emerging relationships between sustainability issues and competitive advantage. Building on the basic concepts of strategic management, this course will explore how managers may effectively deal with the sustainability challenges that they now encounter.\n\nBy encouraging you to reflect on these issues using multiple case studies, discussions and interviews, we will aim to enhance your understanding of alternative models of strategy development in the context of sustainable development.\n\n \n\n                                    ",
