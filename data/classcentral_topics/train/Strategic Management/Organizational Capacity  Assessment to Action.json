Through a mix of lectures and interviews with real nonprofit leaders, students will design their own capacity building plans--using actual data from survey results--to increase the effectiveness of their organizations. The Organizational Capacity Assessment Tool (OCAT), developed by McKinsey &amp; Company and Venture Philanthropy Partners, will be used.\n\n                                    ",
