Part One begins with the political and economic revolutions of the late 1700s and tracks the transformation of the world during the 1800s.  Part One concludes as these bewildering changes seem to be running beyond the capacity of older institutions to handle them.  Throughout the course we try to grasp what is happening and ask:  Why?  And the answers often turn on very human choices.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        From the Traditional to the Modern - Commercial and Military Revolutions (1760-1800)Democratic Revolutions of the Atlantic World (1760-1800)Revolutionary Wars (1800-1830)The World Transformed (1830-1870)The Rise of National Industrial States (1830-1871)The Rise of National Industrial Empires (1871-1900)The Great Acceleration (1890-1910)\n                                    ",
