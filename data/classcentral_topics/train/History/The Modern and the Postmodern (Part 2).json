Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course PagesIntensity and the Ordinary: Sex, Death, Aggression and GuiltWith a focus on Civilization and its Discontents, we examine how Freud’s theories tried to expose profound instincts as they appeared in daily life.Intensity and the Ordinary: Art, Loss, ForgivenessA reading of Virginia Woolf’s modernist novel To the Lighthouse shows how giving up the search for the “really real” can liberate one to attend to the everyday.The Postmodern EverydayWe go back to Ralph Waldo Emerson and forward to Ludwig Wittgenstein to consider how forms of life and language games need to foundation to be compelling.From Critical Theory to PostmodernismThrough a consideration of Max Horkheimer &amp; Theodor Adorno along with Michel Foucault, we confront the philosophical effort to escape from totality in order to understand the politics of control.Paintings IIA very brief consideration of how artists are responding to the loss of foundations to produce work that redefines art. Postmodern IdentitiesWe examine short pieces by Judith Butler and Slavjo Zizek to understand how identities get formed (and performed) in a world without foundations. Late-term ReviewReview of all the thinkers we have studied in Parts I and II of the class, along with some complementary material.Postmodern PragmatismsAfter postmodern playfulness, or alongside it, we see the resurgence of the pragmatic impulse to return philosophy to real human problems.Extra (Optional) Writing Assignment\n                                    ",
