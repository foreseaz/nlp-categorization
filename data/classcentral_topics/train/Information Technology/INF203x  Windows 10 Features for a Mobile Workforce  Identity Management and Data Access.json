Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere.\n\nAn enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users.\n\nIt is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.\n\n                                    ",
