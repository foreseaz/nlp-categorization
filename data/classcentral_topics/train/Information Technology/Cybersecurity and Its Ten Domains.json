Throughout the MOOC, participants will engage in community discourse and online interaction. Participants will gain knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity and its domains. They will engage with expertly produced videos, gain insight from industry experts, participate in knowledge assessments, practice assessing their environmental awareness, and gain access to materials that address governance and risk management, compliance, business continuity and disaster recovery, cryptography, software development security, access control, network security, security architecture, security operations, and physical and environmental security. Learning will be assessed using strategies aligned to knowledge and understanding. \n\nYou do not need prior experience in IT security to do well in this course. All you need is a willingness to learn. We will point you to relevant open and free resources to assist you.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have the option of applying for undergraduate level course credit at Kennesaw State University (dependent on admission to Kennesaw State University as a degree seeking or a non-degree seeking student). More information is available in final module \"Receive Course (undergraduate) Credit at Kennesaw State University\".\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome and Course OverviewCheckout our marquee speaker. She's the Chief Privacy Officer at Coca Cola. Introduction to Security, Access Control, and Software Development SecurityIn this module we cover some of the fundamentals of security that will assist you throughout the course. We will then introduce you to two domains of cyber security: access control and software development security. Focus will be on areas such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well secure software development techniques.Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning and CryptographyIn this module we are going to delve a little deeper into cyber security by covering business continuity and disaster recovery planning and cryptography. Learners will be exposed to what a disruptive event is and how the federal government through agencies such as FEMA handles disasters. We will also covers encryption and decryption and the various techniques used.Information Security Governance and Risk Management &amp; Legal, Regulations, Investigations, and ComplianceIn this module we are going to cover some of the non-technical topics associated to cyber security: Information security governance and risk management and legal, regulations, investigations, and compliance. It is important to realize, that non-technical does not mean easy, or not important. In fact, I would like to argue that they are more important that the technical side of cyber security.Operations Security &amp; Physical and Environmental SecurityIn this module we are going to cover what amount to some of the more intuitive parts of cybersecurity: operations security and physical and environmental security. Learners will understand operations security from a competitor/enemy/hackerâ€™s viewpoint and then develop and apply countermeasures accordingly. Learners will also be exposed to electric power issues such as brownouts, fire detection and suppression, and HVAC.Security Architecture and Design &amp; Telecommunications and Network SecurityIn this module we are going to cover some of the most technical and comprehensive topics that cyber security has to offer as we look at Security Architecture and Design and Telecommunications and Network Security. Learners will be exposed to security models such as Bell LaPadula, Clark-Wilson, Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Access Matrix. We will also describe the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model and its seven layers.Receive Undergraduate Course Credit at Kennesaw State UniversityIn this module we provide details about leveraging this MOOC for credit at the undergraduate level at Kennesaw State University. It is very important that learners follow directions carefully.\n                                    ",
