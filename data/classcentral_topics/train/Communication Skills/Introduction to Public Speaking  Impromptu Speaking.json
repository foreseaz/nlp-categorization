We will demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech, work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication, and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally. One of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers, we will discuss who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker effective. We will critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others.\r\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\r\n\r\nDesign and deliver basic arguments clearly.\r\nDesign and deliver informative presentations clearly.\r\nDesign and deliver complex arguments persuasively.\r\nSpeak confidently with appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety.\r\nEvaluate and critique speeches insightfully.\r\n\n\n                                    ",
