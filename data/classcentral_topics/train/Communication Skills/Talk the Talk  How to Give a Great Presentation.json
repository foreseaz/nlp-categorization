Using resources such as TED Talk videos, you will see how experts deliver professional talks and famous speeches, observe what works, and identify how language connects ideas and keeps a listener engaged.\n\nYou will find your own examples of impressive presentations, share and discuss them with other students. And you will work to create and practise your own talk, which you will record and share with your fellow learners, receiving and providing feedback.\n\nAt the end of the course you will have a powerful presentation you have created and can be proud of, which you can take away with you and present with confidence in your academic, professional or personal life.\n\n\n\n                                    ",
