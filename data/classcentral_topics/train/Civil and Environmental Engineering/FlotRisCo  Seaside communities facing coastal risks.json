Does the risk of erosion and flooding are changing with climate change? What are the means of prevention to overcome these challenges? How to manage the erosion of the coastline? The Mooc FlotRisCo will try to answer these questions. This course builds on methods developed in the framework of an interdisciplinary research program bringing together geographers, geologists, lawyer, economists, psychologists, etc. to the University of Brittany Western (UBO) and to the University of Québec in Rimouski (UQAR) and various institutions.\r\nThe objective of this Mooc is to give you a set of tools to better understand coastal risk and to have a different perpective of coastal vulnerability. Two \"witnesses\" territories will be compared: the Brittany coastline in France and the coastline of Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        W0 - Welcome Week\r\nW1 - Introduction\r\nW2 - Hazards erosion and submersion\r\nW3 - Coastal area vulnerability\r\nW4 - Perceptions and representations of coastal risks\r\nW5 - Coastal Risk Prevention Methods\r\nW6 - Regulatory framework and crisis management\n                                    ",
