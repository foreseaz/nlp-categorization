Pick one from below:\n                                                                    sanitation-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Sanitation is one of\nthe most off-track MDGs and progress in urban sanitation is proving especially\ndifficult to achieve. The traditional response for\nimproving urban sanitation is typically based on a master planning approach\nwhich has widely failed to meet the needs of low-income communities living in\nslums, who cannot afford to pay the expected charges for service improvements. In this course you will learn how to plan for affordable and context-specific\nsanitation solutions using some state-of-the-art sector planning tools and frameworks\nsuch as Sanitation 21, Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) and\nthe Sanitation Systems Approach. By using exercises and concrete examples,\nparticipants will learn how to choose appropriate sanitation systems and\ntechnologies for a variety of urban contexts.\n\nIt is the 2nd MOOC of the series on \"Sanitation, Water and Solid Waste for Development\", which is an\ninitiative of Sandec/Eawag\nand EPFL.\nSandec/Eawag develops and offers the series as WHO\nCollaborating Centre. The dissemination is supported by UNESCO. The first MOOC of the series is entitled \"Introduction\nto Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage\".Version française: Le cours en bref - Planification &amp; design des systèmes et technologies d’Assainissement\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK 1: Introduction to sanitation planning &amp;\nsystems approach About this course; Introduction to urban\nenvironmental sanitation in low- and middle-income countries; Main differences\nbetween rural and urban sanitation; The case for improved sanitation planning\n&amp; programming; Why enabling environments are a precondition for sector\nprogress; Examples of state of the art planning approaches.\n\nWEEK 2: Sanitation systems &amp; technologiesIntroduction to sanitation systems including\nsystem templates, functional groups and products.
