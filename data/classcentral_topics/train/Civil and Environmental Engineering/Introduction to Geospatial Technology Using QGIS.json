The GIS industry is exploding at double-digit employment and income numbers and promises employment opportunities well into the future. Students will learn the fundamentals of GIS and how to build digital maps using open source software that allows free unlimited use for private or commercial applications. All data and software required is included in the course.\r\nTopics covered in this course include GIS, cartography, remote sensing, and spatial analysis through a series of lectures and hands-on computer-based exercises. This course is designed to be used as a stand-alone course to complement other disciplines or as an entry level course into a geospatial program. Course content is based upon the United States Department of Laborâ€™s Geospatial Technology Competency Model for entry level geospatial occupations, including Geospatial or GIS Technicians and Technologists.\r\nLearning Outcomes/Competencies\r\n\r\nDescribe the fundamental concepts of Geographic Information Science and Technology.\r\nDemonstrate proficiency in the basic functions of geospatial software.\r\nDemonstrate awareness of fundamental remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques.\r\nDemonstrate basic proficiency in map creation and design principles, including thematic map display, employment of map projections, and cartographic design.\r\nDemonstrate proficiency in the creation and acquisition of spatial data.\r\n\r\nCredit\r\nStudents have the option to receive continuing education credit from a regionally accredited college.\n\n                                    ",
