We also discuss the principles behind the manufacturing of those materials. This course will contain discussion forums and be self-paced.\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nThing One: The Menu of Materials\r\nThing Two: Point Defects Explain Solid State Diffusion\r\nThing Three: Dislocations Explain Plastic Deformation\r\nThing Four: Stress vs. Strain\r\nThing Five: Creep Deformation\r\nThing Six: The Ductile to Brittle Transition\r\nThing Seven: Fracture Toughness\r\nThing Eight: Fatigue\r\nThing Nine: Making Things Fast and Slow\r\nThing Ten: A Brief History of Semiconductors\r\n\n\n                                    ",
