In the smart city, the innovative use of data helps provide better and more inventive services to improve peopleâ€™s lives and make the entire city run more smoothly. But the data our cities collect nowadays is more massive and varied, and is accessed at higher speeds than ever before. This is Big Data. New technologies are constantly being developed to better manage Big Data. This computer science course, from the IEEE Smart Cities initiative and the University of Trento, helps students understand and use these new technologies to help improve a city.\n\nOur international team of instructors and content experts discuss the fundamental concepts of Big Data and how it has changed Data Management. They provide a vision for managing Big Data today, and how we can make Big Data work for the smart city.\n\nVerified students are eligible to earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and Professional Development Hours (PDHs), valid toward continuing education requirements for many professional certifications.\n\n                                    ",
