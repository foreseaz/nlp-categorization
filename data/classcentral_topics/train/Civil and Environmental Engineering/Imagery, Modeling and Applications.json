In this class you will become comfortable with spatial analysis and applications within GIS during four week-long modules:\n\nWeek 1: Learn the foundational tools for advanced raster analysis\n\nWeek 2: Examine digital elevation models using ArcGIS tools and create derived products such as hillshades and slope rasters.\n\nWeek 3: Become familiar with common algorithms for spatial decision making such as suitability analyses and hydrologic processing. You will also learn how to analyze aerial and satellite imagery to perform time-based analysis.\n\nWeek 4: Explore the advanced ModelBuilder tool, a visual programming language that allows you to automate sections of your data analysis\n\nTake Imagery, Modeling and Applications as a standalone course or as part of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialization. By completing the fourth class you will gain the skills needed to succeed in the Specialization capstone.\n\n                                    ",
