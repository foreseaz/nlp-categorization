Please note that we will take a spring break from March 9 - 14. Weeks 1 - 6 will cover material from the book America's Constitution: A Biography.  Weeks 7 - 12 will cover material from the book America's Unwritten Constitution. We will cover two chapter topics each week.  We will also provide \"bonus content\" each week. The nature of this content will vary. It might be a video conversation between Professor Amar and students or colleagues. It might be a live video chat with the teaching assistants. It might be one hour where the TAs answer questions in real-time in one of the discussion forums. Each writing assignment will have 3 options; you should choose one option to submit.  When you evaluate your peers' assignments, please make sure you grade the same option that you selected.  E.g., If you submitted an assignment for \"Essay 1 (Option 3)\" you should only evaluate other students who submitted Option 3.Week 1Monday, January 27: \"In The Beginning\" video lectures released Wednesday, January 29: \"In The Beginning\" bonus content released Wednesday, January 29: \"New Rules for a New World\" video lectures released Friday, January 31: \"New Rules for a New World\" bonus content released Week 2Monday, February 3: \"Congressional Powers\" and \"America's First Officer\" video lectures released Wednesday, February 5: \"Congressional Powers\" bonus content released Friday, February 7: \"America's First Officer\" bonus content released Week 3Monday, February 10: Quiz #1 ReleasedMonday, February 10: \"Presidential Powers\" and \"Judges and Juries\" video lectures released Friday, February 14: bonus content releasedWeek 4Monday, February 17: Quiz #1 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Full CreditMonday, February 17: \"States and Territories\" and \"The Law of the Land\" video lectures released Friday, February 21: bonus content releasedWeek 5Monday, February 24: Writing Assignment #1 ReleasedMonday, February 24: Quiz #1 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Partial Credit (5% per day late penalty)Monday, February 24: \"Making Amends\" and \"A New Birth of Freedom\" video lectures released Friday, February 28: bonus content releasedWeek 6Monday, March 3: Writing Assignment #1 Due; Writing Assignment #1 Evaluation Period BeginsMonday, March 3: \"Progressive Reforms\" and \"Modern Moves\" video lectures released Friday, March 7: bonus content releasedSunday, March 9: Writing Assignment #1 Evaluation Period EndsONE WEEK SPRING BREAK: MONDAY, MARCH 10 - FRIDAY MARCH 14 Week 7Monday, March 17: Quiz #2 Released.Monday, March 17: \"Reading Between the Lines\" and \"Heeding the Deed\" video lectures released Friday, March 21: bonus content released Week 8Monday, March 24: Quiz #2 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Full CreditMonday, March 24: \"Hearing the People\" and \"Confronting Modern Case Law\" video lectures releasedFriday, March 28: bonus content released Week 9Monday, March 31: Writing Assignment #2 ReleasedMonday, March 31: Quiz #2 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Partial Credit (5% per day late penalty)Monday, March 31: \"Putting Precedent in its Place\" and \"Honoring the Icons\" video lectures released Friday, April 4: bonus content releasedWeek 10Monday, April 7: Writing Assignment #2 Due; Writing Assignment #2 Evaluation Period BeginsMonday, April 7: \"'Remembering the Ladies'\" and \"Following Washington's Lead\" video lectures released Friday, April 11: bonus content releasedSunday, April 13: Writing Assignment #2 Evaluation Period EndsWeek 11Monday, April 14: Quiz #3 ReleasedMonday, April 14: \"Interpreting Government Practices\" and \"Joining the Party\" video lectures released Friday, April 18: bonus content releasedWeek 12 and BeyondMonday, April 21: Quiz #3 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Full CreditMonday, April 21: Writing Assignment #3 ReleasedMonday, April 21: \"Doing the Right Thing\" and \"Envisioning the Future\" video lectures released Friday, April 25: bonus content releasedMonday, April 28: Writing Assignment #3 Due; Writing Assignment #3 Evaluation Period Begins; Quiz #3 Due In Order To Be Eligible For Partial Credit (5% per day late penalty)Sunday, May 4: Writing Assignment #3 Evaluation Period Ends\n                                    ",
