Topics covered this week include how one becomes a U.S. citizen, how citizenship at birth is determined in this and other countries, the concept of \"dual citizenship,\" and how citizenship might be lost. What rights come with citizenship? What are the reasons for becoming a U.S. citizen if a non-citizen is a lawful permanent resident?From Non-Citizen to Citizen: The Naturalization ProcessCitizenship at Birth: Jus Soli and Jus SanguinisThe Fourteenth Amendment's Birthright Citizenship ClauseStatus of Persons Born in U.S. Territories and PossessionsRights and Responsibilities of U.S. CitizensProof of Citizenship; Dual Nationality; Loss of CitizenshipU.S. Citizenship for Sale? (optional lecture)Week 2: History of U.S. ImmigrationHaving considered the legal distinction between citizens and non-citizens in week one, we now turn to immigration into the United States, the first step toward attaining citizenship. Laws governing who may enter the country, the conditions of entry, and actions that may result in deportation will occupy the remainder of the course. This week we examine the history of U.S. immigration. Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 1880's, U.S. law has at times discriminated against specific racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, the most important constitutional law doctrines governing U.S. immigration law solidified during those eras. The modern constitutional doctrine of \"plenary power\" is introduced here.Myths and Realities of an \"Open Border\" PastThe Chinese Exclusion Acts and the U.S. Supreme CourtThe \"Plenary Power\" Doctrine in U.S. Constitutional LawModern Structure: Federal Agencies and CourtsThe Faces of Immigration Today: NumbersWeek 3: Eligibility for Immigration, Part IThis week we will consider the requirements for legal immigration to the U.S. These come in the form of general criteria applicable to all who seek to enter (e.g., no criminal history, not likely to become a \"public charge\"), as well as specific requirements for an entry visa and the \"green card\" -- permission to remain in the United States indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident.Requirements for Entry:  Introduction to the Grounds of InadmissibilityInadmissibility Based on Immigration ControlInadmissibility Based on National SecurityInadmissibility Based on Criminal ActsInadmissibility Based on Public HealthInadmissibility on Economic GroundsProcedures to Determine AdmissibilityWeek 4: Eligibility for Immigration, Part IIWeek four continues our examination of eligibility for non-U.S. citizens to enter or remain in the country. This week focuses more closely on categories of immigrants -- guest workers, business employees, and family members, as well as temporary visitors such as students and tourists. Along with border security, these visa categories are at the center of current debates over immigration reform, given that the waiting time for some persons eligible to immigrate to the United States can reach decades. Recent proposals for immigration reform are noted here.The \"Green Card\" and a Broken Immigration SystemPermanent Residency through Family RelationshipCitizenship through Marriage and the Marriage Fraud ActImmigration through EmploymentRefugees and AsylumU.S. Immigration ReformWeek 5: Breaking the Rules: Deportation Proceedings and Border SecurityOur concluding week focuses upon the various grounds for deportation, deportation proceedings, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration court system. Border security measures seek to protect the nation's security as well as public health and safety. Of particular interest is the \"extended border control\" capability of the Department of Homeland Security. Enhanced border security is one key to political compromise on immigration reform, providing a final opportunity in this course to consider the future direction of immigration law in the United States.\n                                    ",
