Our hope is that this course will help boost your curiosity and positively influence or even help to determine your future professional career.\n\nThis course is for anyone is who is curious about how our world is constructed and wants to learn more about our universe and the nature surrounding us.\n\nKnowledge of physics and mathematics is NOT required. Basic school level will be quite enough.\n\n                                    ",
