Often, physics lectures are flooded with heavy formulae, including calculus. In this course, efforts have been made to help students feel physics in addition to learning. Using minimal algebra without calculus, most of the key concepts in classical mechanics have been explained. Various real physics demonstrations also help students to grasp physics from everyday experience.\n\n034.005-1x is the first part of “Introductory Physics (034.005)”, which is taught to the first year undergraduate students of Seoul National University. The course covers the basics of Newtonian mechanics including oscillations and wave phenomena. The second part, focusing on fluid dynamics and thermal physics, will be offered in Fall of 2014.\n\n                                    ",
