Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin. Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    fsi-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    What is  fluid-solid interactions  ?  It\nis what happens when the  motions of a\nfluid and of a solid are somehow coupled. This\nhappens  all the time,  around\nyou when leaves flutter in the wind,  inside you when your heart beats, above you\nwhen wings of a plane vibrate, under the sea... \n\nThe\nidea behind this MOOC  is to give you the\nbasic tools to  be able to predict and\neventually mitigate   things called  flutter, galloping, sloshing, vortex-induced\nvibrations, added mass,  to cite a few.  We are\ngoing to consider  any  possible domains of applications  such as civil engineering,  aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering ,\nocean engineering, biomechanics and even food \nprocessing ! \n\nThis is why\nwe  called the course “Fundamentals of\nFluid Solid Interactions ”. There are so many phenomena and so many models  that  we\n  need to work together on the basic\nmechanisms . If  you want to see how fluid-solid interactions\nwork,  and be able to use that knowledge,\njoin us !\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week\n1 :  Dimensional analysis of fluid-solid couplingThe variety of fluid-solid couplingsDimensional analysis as a classification toolDimensionless numbers in fluid-solid interactions From dimensionless numbers to dimensionless equationsWeek 2 : A solid with a still\nfluid.
