Over the last decades it became a very productive scientific category, too. Thinking about spaces, places, locations, or landscapes covers a spectrum of meanings from the concrete and material through to the abstract and metaphorical. In this course we explore various categories of space in the field of Old Norse culture. Together with international guest scholars from different fields we want to find out how mythological, heroic, historical, geographical spaces or landscapes look like in written and oral narratives, but also on picture-stones, runic inscriptions, paintings, woodcarvings and manuscripts. Another promising question could be to ask about the relationship between texts, images and maps and the process of mapping itself.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1  \n\nIntroduction and course overview: space as\na key element of narration and representation\n\nWeek 2                                        \n\nConstructing mythological space: Eddic\ncosmography\n\nSources: Prose-Edda, Poetic Edda\n\nWeek 3                      \n\nDiscovering new spaces: geographical and\nsocial aspects; memory and space\n\nSources: Sagas (Grænlendinga saga, Eiríks saga rauða)\n\nWeek 4                              \n\nCosmography: descriptions of the world in\ntexts\n\nSources: Leiðarvísir (Itinerary of Nikulas)\n\nWeek 5                          \n\nMapping the World: Cartography\n\nSources: Carta Marina\n\nWeek 6 Spatiality in visual media\n\nSources: picture-stones, runic\ninscriptions, paintings, woodcarvings, manuscripts\n\nWeek 7 Archaeology:\n\nSources:\n\nWeek 8 Language and space: spatial thinking in\nlanguage; place names\n\nSources:Conclusion and outlook\n                                    ",
