Classically, light consists of electromagnetic waves, which are fully described by Maxwell's equations. On the quantum level, however, this description has to be extended to introduce the concept of the photon.Quantum Optics is about how light is described in terms of photons, and how the interaction of photons with matter such as atoms can be understood. We will see that, on the one hand, things that we take as a given in a classical description can be naturally derived in the quantum optical context from fundamental principles. On the other hand, the quantum descriptions allows for novel types of light with properties that can not occur with a purely classical description.Quantum optics also predicts some very counter-intuitive effects such as an optical coupling to empty vacuum - which can be experimentally tested and have actually been confirmed in laboratories around the world!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Semiclassical Light-Atom InteractionIntroduction, Overview of classical, semiclassical and q.m. modelsInteraction Hamiltonian of charged particle with e.m. fieldTime Dependent Perturbation TheoryTransition RatesFermi-Golden RuleTwo-level atomOscillationg dipolesBloch sphereDensity Operator - Density MatrixOptical Bloch EquationsRabi Frequency, Saturation Parameter, Spontaneous DecayLineshape in Fluorescence - Saturation BroadeningLambert-Beer LawBloch VectorRamsey MethodMach Zehnder InterferometerQuantization of the Electromagnetic FieldQuantized ModesRecap: Quantum Mechanics of Harmonic OscillatorLadder Operators, Number OperatorQuadrature OperatorsQuantization of the EM FieldHamiltonian of Radiation FieldEnergy of Vacuum StateFock StatesCoherent StatesSqueezed States, Thermal StatesPlanck's Black Body Radiation FormulaBeam Splitters and InterferometersBeam SplitterClassical description of beam splitterQM description of beam splitterQuantized Mach Zehnder InterferometerHomodyne / Heterodyne DetectionQuantized Light-Atom InteractionInteraction HamiltonianJaynes Cummings HamiltonianQuantum Rabi OscillationsVacuum Rabi Oscillations, Collapse &amp; RevivalsElements of Cavity QEDOptical CavitiesMicrowave Cavities and Rydberg AtomsSeeing a Photon Without Destroying itRabi Oscillations in Dressed State Picture\n                                    ",
