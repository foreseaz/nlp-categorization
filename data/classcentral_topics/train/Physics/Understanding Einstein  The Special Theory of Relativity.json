Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    einstein-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    In this course we will seek to “understand Einstein,” especially focusing\non the special theory of relativity that Albert Einstein, as a 26-year-old\npatent clerk, introduced in his so-called “miracle year” of 1905. Our goal\nwill be to go behind the myth-making and beyond the popularized presentations\nof relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both Einstein\nthe person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his\ntheory. Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein\ncome up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the\nmeaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity?\nWhy did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean\nto say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more\nslowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending\non their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things\ntravel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the\ncenter of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence\nthat definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why\ndidn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n\nStudents may choose one of three approaches to the course: a more quantitative\napproach, a more qualitative approach, or an auditing approach. The more\nquantitative approach will include weekly problem sets, while the more\nqualitative approach will include a creative project relating to the young\nEinstein and/or the special theory of relativity.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One (Einstein in Context): Einstein quotes of the week; a thought\nexperiment involving relativity; physics and Einstein circa 1900.\n\nWeek Two (Events, Clocks, and Reference Frames): Einstein quotes\nof the week; synchronizing clocks; the famous June 1905 paper; thinking\nmore deeply about events and observers; understanding inertial frames of\nreference; spacetime diagrams; the Galilean transformation; Einstein's\nstarting point: the two postulates.\n\nWeek Three (Ethereal Problems and Solutions): Einstein quotes of\nthe week; a few words about waves; the luminiferous ether; the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment vs. stellar aberration; how do you solve a problem like the\nether?; the solutions of Fitzgerald, Lorentz, Poincare, and Einstein.\n\nWeek Four (The Weirdness Begins): Einstein quotes of the week; the\nlight constancy principle; time and length are suspect; what isn't suspect;\nexploring the Lorentz factor; the miracle of the muon.\n\nWeek Five (Spacetime Switching): Einstein quotes of the week; the\nLorentz transformation; leading clocks lag; the ultimate speed limit.\n\nWeek Six (Breaking the Spacetime Speed Limit?): Einstein quotes\nof the week; spacetime diagrams revisited; regions of spacetime; cause\nand effect, or vice versa?; faster than light paradoxes.\n\nWeek Seven (Paradoxes to Ponder): Einstein quotes of the week;\nthe pole-in-the-barn paradox; the spaceships-on-a-rope paradox; how length\ncontraction actually works; the twin paradox.\n\nWeek Eight (To the Center of the Galaxy and Back): Einstein quotes\nof the week; traveling the galaxy in one lifetime; the reception of relativity;\nEinstein's Nobel Prize and the nature of genius; relativity beyond science.\n\n                                    ",
