Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students.

Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    graphene-001\n                                                                    graphene-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    The new field of 2-dimensional (2-d) materials has seen\nexponential growth since the isolation of graphene, a single atomic layer of\ncarbon atoms, at University of Manchester in 2004. What is a 2-d material, and\nhow is it different to 3-dimensional materials that we encounter every day? How\ndoes the 2-d nature affect the material’s properties, for instance, how do\nelectrons living in a 2-d world behave? How would we harness the unique\nproperties of 2-d materials and put them to use in real-world applications? We\nwill answer these questions and more in this course on Graphene and other 2-d\nmaterials. \n\nThe course will describe how a number of key\naspects of the broader field of nanomaterials are applied to study 2-d\nmaterials, including methods of production such as chemical vapour deposition,\ncharacterisation techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy,\nand the production of nano-electronic and nano-composite structures.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction\n\nWhat is graphene?
