In this UX course we will focus on how to interact with users (or potential users) to understand what they need, what they currently do, what they love and hate, and examine human capabilities and behavior as they relate to UX design.\n\nLearners will be introduced to numerous techniques to gather data from and about users.\n\n                                    ",
