I play very simply. That's what it's all about. Playing simple football is the hardest thing.”If we think about it, design is everything. It can be football, but it can also be an object, a building, a game… our lives, our worlds!In this part of the Design 1o1 Redux, we will go out and “get busy” designing our very own worlds. Something for which we will need to master a high level of simplicity.We will work with all kinds of cool apps for phones and tablets (do you have a smartphone or tablet?). We will also share our works with the others on Instagram, using special hashtags.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: My NeighborhoodWeek 2: My TownWeek 3: My TripsWeek 4: My NatureWeek 5: My ShelterWeek 6: My ThingWeek 7: My ExamWeek 8: My Break\n                                    ",
