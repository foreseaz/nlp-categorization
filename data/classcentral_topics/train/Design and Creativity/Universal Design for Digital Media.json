Although these elements are important, other factors are equally if not more crucial for the design of successful websites and other digital media. This course will examine the standards and methods for designing digital material, primarily websites, that are not only accessible for persons with disabilities—a particularly important requirement for the websites of public entities—but also effective and usable for all users and across platforms.\r\nThis course will review standards for usability and accessibility, focusing on the concepts of universal design, Web Standards, and accessibility best practices. Topics to be covered include html standards, semantic web design, user-centered design, and validation tools, among others.\n\n                                    ",
