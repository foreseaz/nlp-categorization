The course challenges you to experience the design process yourself and reflect on your work with the help of students and excellent teaching staff from Delft, and industrial experts. \n\nNo previous knowledge of design methods is required, yet some experience with designing (something) is helpful.\n\n\n\n \n\nLicense\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ",
