Visual Representation is a mode of non-linguistic and nonverbal communication. It involves a wide range of symbolic icons that cannot be comprehended solely through intuition. The course introduces numerous theoretical constructs that enable its audiences to primarily understand the nature of visual medium and eventually develop a visual vocabulary to decode visual messages with a semiotic approach. The knowledge is instrumental in visual analysis, critical art appreciation, theoretical and practical art and design endeavors.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.
