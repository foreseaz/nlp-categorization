Aside from the course content being designed with the old platform in mind, a reliable distribution of assignments to peer-markers for evaluation is not possible.  To overcome this, the course co-ordinators have been evaluating almost all assignments.  This is not sustainable in the long term.\n\nIn addition, the full Symmetry course is university credit bearing and cannot be reliably implemented on the new platform.  This is a major limitation for NTU.\n\nFor these reasons, we are phasing out the Symmetry MOOC, beginning with a freeze of enrolments from early May, and a total shutdown from around October.\n\nWe thank our students for your support and patience in accessing the course materials and waiting for assignment marking.\n\nTim White\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Concepts in Symmetry IDear Students, \n\nOver the past 9 months we have been trailing the feasibility of transferring the Session-Based version of this course to the new On-Demand platform.
