In this part of the Design 1o1 Redux, we will rethink these components in order to design our own “homes”, the places where we live (or, “where the heart is” as Pliny the Elder would say).Can we trap time into space? How to frame the ordinary? These are some of the many things we will explore!To do so, we will work with all kinds of cool apps for phones and tablets (do you have a smartphone or tablet?). We will also share our works with the others on Instagram, using special hashtags.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: My RoomWeek 2: My KitchenWeek 3: My GardenWeek 4: My GuestsWeek 5: My BasementWeek 6: My ShowWeek 7: My ExamWeek 8: My Break\n                                    ",
