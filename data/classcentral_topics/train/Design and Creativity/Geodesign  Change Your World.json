Pick one from below:\n                                                                    geodesign-001\n                                                                    geodesign-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Our world is awash in facts and information,\nwhich are now easily accessible.  So why\nare so many bad decisions being made? \nWhat is needed is creativity and design that brings those facts to life\n– to create a vision and choices as well as an understanding about the\npotential impacts of those choices.  The\ngeodesign process has evolved over nearly 40 years and now combines the core\nconcepts of design thinking with the latest in geo-spatial technologies.Geodesign is a proven form of design that\nuses techniques and practices from a multitude of professions to determine\noptimal ways to design for complex land use challenges. It is a collaborative\nprocess that capitalizes on the strengths of people with a variety of expertise\nto create and implement unique models to aid in the design decision-making\nprocess.Our MOOC will introduce the average person to\nthe core concepts of geodesign through real-world examples which showcase how\ngeodesign has worked across the globe.  People\nfrom all walks of life with interests in science, design, sustainability and\nenvironmental stewardship will want to learn about geodesign.  Together we will explore how anyone can use\nthe geodesign process to work with others to effect change in their world.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One:  Shared LanguagesThe key underpinnings of geodesign include aspects we all share: spatial thinking, creative change, and being rooted in real places.Week Two: The Three D's of GeodesignDecision is the driver but one must also consider Data and Design.  Week Three: The Three C's of GeodesignDealing with tough challenges is the main issue.  Imbedded in those are Complexity, Computation, and Collaboration.  Week Four: The Influence of ContextPlace matters and is shaped by culture.  Who are the people of the place and what scale is best?Week Five: Process and Framework  The value of a proven process.  How to set up a project, outline an approach, understand the options, and get feedback about the impacts.\n                                    ",
