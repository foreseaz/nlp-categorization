Who, and what, are poems for? For poets? Readers? To give vent to the soul? To paint or sculpt with words? Alter consciousness? Raise cultural tone? Students will read, write about and also recite American poems.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.
