In Aboriginal culture, in early\nEuropean encounters, and in later white settlement, we see how the haunting and\nawe-inspiring landscapes of Australia have shaped and influenced a fascinating\nworld of literature.This course\nintroduces you to a varied range of Australian literary works, beginning with\nIndigenous traditions and including colonial, early twentieth-century and\ncontemporary writing. The texts for study include works of local and regional\nfocus and others that engage with the wider world; some are classic works, some\nare popular.The course\noffers a rough guide to some of the traditions and themes of Australian\nwriting. Our starting point is the country, and each of the four main weeks\nfocuses on different literary versions of a place, a landscape, or locale.\nPerspectives on the literary works is from both inside and outside, from within\nthe traditions of writing in Australia and from a global view.There are\ntales of the deep time of Aboriginal creation in central Australia, of first\ncontact between Europeans and the fabled southern continent, of crime and\npunishment, of gold-seeking and spiritual quest, of tragedies in the desert, of\nfamilies divided between the southern and northern hemispheres, of expatriate\nlives. All across a range of songs, fiction, poetry, popular legend and\nnon-fiction. Throughout the journey of this course we follow the ways writers\nhave adapted their language and narrative to the Australian environment and its\nhistory.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1            literature\n&amp; countryLesson 1Lecture 1.1\nintro: literature &amp; country (course details)Lecture 1.2 literature\n&amp; country (Tim Winton and different coasts)Lecture 1.3 literature\n&amp; country (D.
