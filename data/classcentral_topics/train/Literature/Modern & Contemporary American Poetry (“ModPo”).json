Participants (who need no prior experience with poetry) will learn how to read poems that are supposedly \"difficult.\" We encounter and discuss the poems one at a time. It's much easier than it seems! Join us and try it!\n\nThe next live, interactive 10-week session of ModPo will begin on September 10, 2016, and will conclude on November 21, 2016. Al Filreis will be in touch with you by email before the September 10 start of the course with all the information you'll need to participate. \n\nDuring the 10 weeks of the course, you will be guided through poems, video discussions of each poem, and community discussions of each poem. And (unique among open online courses) we offer weekly, interactive live webcasts. Our famed TAs also offer office hours throughout the week. We help arrange meet-ups and in-site study groups. \n\nIf you are curious about the ModPo team, type \"ModPo YouTube introduction\" into Google or your favorite search engine, and watch the 20-minute introductory video. You will get an overview of the course and will meet the brilliant TAs, who will be encountering the poems with you all the way to the end.\n\nIf you use Facebook, join the always-thriving ModPo group: from inside Facebook, search for \"Modern &amp; Contemporary American Poetry\" and then request to be added as a member. If you have any questions about ModPo, you can post a question to the FB group and you'll receive an almost instant reply.\n\nWe tweet all year long at @ModPoPenn and you can also find ModPo colleagues using the hashtag #ModPoLive.\n\nModPo is hosted by—and is housed at—the Kelly Writers House at 3805 Locust Walk on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia USA. All ModPo'ers are welcome to visit the Writers House when they are in our area. Our discussions are filmed there. Our live webcasts take place in the famed \"Arts Cafe\" of the House. To find out what's going on at the Writers House any time, just dial 215-746-POEM.\n\n                                    ",
