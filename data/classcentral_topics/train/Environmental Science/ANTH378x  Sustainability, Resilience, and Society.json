How does our individual ‘ecological footprint’ matter among the billions of humans’ footprints on earth? How are we alike and different in our impacts, depending on where we live; and how does civic and governmental attitude impact sustainability and resilience in the future? These questions will be explored on a global, local and personal level in this introductory course. Students will compare and contrast case studies from suburban Seattle to rural, mountainous China and consider their own significant impacts on ecology.\n\nTogether, we will go over the concepts of sustainability and resilience, and analyze your impact on our environment. For a global perspective, we will go over a case study of societal impacts. Our emphasis will be on translating theory to individual impact and comprehension.\n\nNo previous knowledge is needed. We welcome your voice and look forward to your participation!\n\nANTH 378x is the first five weeks of the full course offered by the University of Washington online Integrated Social Science bachelor’s completion degree. \n\n                                    ",
