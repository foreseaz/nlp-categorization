How has the earth evolved into its present state?\n\nThis course is an introduction to earth science, focusing on the deep earth. We will learn how temperature and chemical compositions inside the Earth are inferred from limited observations combined with laboratory experiments. We will also explore the fate of water on the early Earth related to advanced research questions. Upon finishing this course, you will learn how scientists interpret the unknown and use the scientific method to address immeasurable research challenges.\n\nNo specific knowledge is needed. Join this course and let’s imagine the inside of the Earth together.\n\n                                    ",
