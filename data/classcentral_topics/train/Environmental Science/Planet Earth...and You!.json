If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motions—all of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today.  Planet Earth presents an overview of several aspects of our home, from a geological perspective.  We begin with earthquakes—what they are, what causes them, what effects they have, and what we can do about them. We will emphasize that plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters such as earthquakes—occur where they do.  We consider volcanoes, types of eruptions, and typical rocks found there. Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK 1:  Earthquakes!Just what is an earthquake?Recording and measuring shakesConsequences of quakesPrediction and preparation\nWEEK 2:  Plate TectonicsContinental drift and sea-floor spreadingWhat is a plate?Plate boundariesEarthquakes and plate tectonics\nWEEK 3:  Volcanoes!Where does molten rock come from?Introduction to igneous rocksTypes of eruptionsVolcanic hazards \nWEEK 4:  Riches in RocksWhat is the \"stuff\" of modern life?Where do the elements come from?Soil: the base for lifeMining metals and quarrying rocks\nWEEK 5:  The Sources of PowerWhat's the \"fossil\" in fossil fuel?How do we find oil?Nuclear powerEnergy challenges in the future\n\n                                    ",
