Reducing such costs associated with poor water\nand sanitation services is one of the major challenges for States in the low and middle income countries in the 21st century. The technologies to provide networked water\nand sanitation services are well-known, as are many low-cost, non-network\nsolutions that would appear affordable to many poor households in developing\ncountries. For decades the international community and national governments\nhave struggled to find institutional and financial arrangements to provide\nthese technologies to households and businesses in developing countries, with\nmixed success. Although progress is being made in many parts of the world,\nmillions of households in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still face a\nlifetime without the improved water and sanitation services that citizens in\nindustrialized countries take for granted. \n\nThe second part will focus on what can be done to solve global water\nand sanitation problems. We will examine the main strategies that donors and\nnational governments have tried to change status quo water and sanitation\nconditions, and the lessons learned from these experiences. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 1: Problem Diagnosis – Lectures, Videos, Online discussion  Week 1: Introduction – Current patterns and future trends in coverage of both network infrastructure and non-piped solutions in urban and rural areas of the low and middle income countriesWeek 2: Political Economy – Water markets, water vending systems, corruptionWeek 3: Supply – Technological options available and the associated costs of providing improved water and sanitation servicesWeek 4: Demand – Understanding household water and sanitation behaviorWeek 5: Outcomes and climate changeWeek 6: Water Development Paths\n                                    ",
