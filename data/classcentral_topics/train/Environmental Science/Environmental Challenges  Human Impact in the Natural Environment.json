They also like to look for ‘cause and effect’, reducing action and reaction to defined components. However, complex patterns in ecology are not always causal and predictable. Populations have their own dynamics that can be independent of external environmental conditions.\n\nAlthough living systems are complex, there are also some clear patterns and simple relationships that appear to be fairly constant.  In this course we look at the way that natural systems are organised, and consider how our intuition can help us decipher the dynamic.\n\nIntrigued?  Then sign up for this short course to find out more.\n\nEarn credit from the University of Leeds\n\nThis course is part of the Environmental Challenges program from the University of Leeds. When you complete all five courses in the program and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will be eligible to join a final assessment course that leads to the award of 10 credits from the University of Leeds.\n\nGain a key environmental management skill\n\nEach course in the program includes an exercise and revision material to help you develop a skill that is key to working in environmental management – this course develops your mathematical skills to help you understand regression and the limitations of statistical testing.\n\nChoose how you would like to learn\n\n\n  \n    If you have a general interest in this topic, you can work through the activities in around three hours each week. You will have the opportunity to check your understanding and spend some time joining the discussions.\n  \n  \n    If you would like to know more about the topic, you can spend up to an extra two hours a week reading the additional materials and watching the videos provided in the ‘Downloads’ and ‘See also’ sections within some course steps. By doing this, you will have the required knowledge to attempt the end of course test.\n  \n  \n    If you have more time to study, you can also complete the optional revision activity and join a live Q&amp;A session in the second week of the course – this will help you when you attempt the end of course test. You will need to allow a further two hours a week to cover the revision tasks.\n  \n\n\n\n                                    ",
