The content and learning outcomes of this new course will be designed to be relevant across different food production sectors (i.e., beef, dairy, poultry,\n    and pigs). While the instructors will provide the participants with a strong scientific base for understanding the impact of infectious disease in animal-based food production, the emphasis of the material will be on practical problem-solving and\nwill be    directed towards equipping participants with a platform for developing the skills needed to contribute to sustainable food production.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: How does livestock disease impact the affordability and\nsustainability of food production?\nWeek 2: What causes infectious disease in animals?\nWeek 3: How does the host respond to infectious disease?\nWeek 4: What is the impact of caregivers, the environment, and management\nsystems on host response and disease transmission?\nWeek 5: How do infectious diseases behave in production animal\npopulations?\nWeek 6: How do pathogens, animal management practices, and cultural norms influence human health?\n                                    ",
