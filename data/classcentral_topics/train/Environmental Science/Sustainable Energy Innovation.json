In this eight-week experience, you will begin developing profitable social and technological innovations to tackle our pressing energy and climate obligations. Course content includes videos and short readings carefully selected and organized to be accessible to a wide audience regardless of nationality, educational background, professional interests, or academic focus.\r\n\r\nAll of the assigned work in this course is designed to help you dream up and begin developing your own sustainable energy innovation. Your innovation may be a physical product, or a service. It may be a technical innovation, or a social one. It need not make you rich, but you will be challenged to at least make your project self-supporting. The course materials, my feedback, and, most importantly, interactions with your classmates, will all help as you try to make your ideas real. You can complete the coursework in two to four hours per week, and any additional time you spend will just improve the chances your project is successful.\r\n\r\nStudents should have completed the Intro to Sustainable Energy course on Canvas Network, or something similar, prior to taking this course.\n\n                                    ",
