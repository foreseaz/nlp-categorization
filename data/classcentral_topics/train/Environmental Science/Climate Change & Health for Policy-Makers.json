They offer you a short crash-course into the topic of climate change, tailored to senior policy-makers and negotiators of climate agreements, particularly as an input into the climate conference COP21 in Paris in December this year.This 1 week MOOC requires 3 hours of investment time and provides hard evidence for four key arguments as to why health is and should be central in climate policy.Two positive arguments:1. Health is a positive motivator, a driving force for citizens and policy-makers to care about and act on climate change.2. The huge health co-benefits must enter the risk-benefit calculations.However, two arguments pertain to the restrictions that our health and physiology impose on humans under climate change, particularly in a world that is +4Â°C warmer:1. There are health limits to adaptation.2. Decreased work productivity in hot countries.Finally, we should consider health as an indicator, not only for sustainable development, but also for climate policy.\n\n                                    ",
