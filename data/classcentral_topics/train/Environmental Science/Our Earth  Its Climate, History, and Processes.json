Students are challenged to think of the Earth as an integrated system made up of water, air, ice, land, and life.  For example, students learn that the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago produced massive extinctions of life on Earth that forever altered the dominant types of single-celled life.  Students are exposed to how new scientific discoveries are made through the observations that led to plate tectonics, how the Moon formed, and why dinosaurs went extinct.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.  Building blocks of the Earth's climateHow science worksHow Earth's climate worksWhat is geologic time?Rocks and mineralsHow old is the Earth?2. Formation, evolution, and processes of the solid EarthFormation of the EarthFormation of the MoonPlate tectonicsThe first continentsEarth's magnetic fieldMid-ocean ridges and subduction zonesSupercontinentsContinent–continent collisions (Example: the Himalaya)3. Water in the Earth's climate system: Oceans, atmosphere, and cryosphereThe oceans: How they regulate the Earth's climateThe cryosphere: Ice on our planetThe atmosphere: Our protective layer and weather-maker4. Life, and its effect on the Earth's climate systemEvolution of the atmosphereSingle cells and hard shellsLife on landDeath from above (and below): Mass extinctionsThe course presents four weeks of primary content, but runs for five weeks to allow students time to complete all assignments. Although the course is structured as separate weeks, all material will be available from the beginning.\n                                    ",
