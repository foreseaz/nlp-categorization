Participants will learn to think critically about the value of Antarctic field research and to look at the different ways scientists, policymakers, journalists and artists engage with Antarctic science, and the Antarctic continent more broadly. The course consists of three two-week modules on Antarctic history, geology and culture.\n\n                                    ",
