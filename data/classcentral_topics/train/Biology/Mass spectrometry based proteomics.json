It does so by producing charged molecular species in vacuum followed by its separation in the magnetic and electric fields on the basis of their mass to charge (m/z) ratio. MALDI and ESI- coupled with mass analyzers are commonly used mass spectrometer configuration in proteomics. The human proteome draft was decoded by using high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.\r\nIn this module, we will discuss the basics of mass spectrometry, sample preparations, liquid chromatography, hybrid mass spectrometers and quantitative proteomics techniques such as iTRAQ, SILAC and TMT using mass spectrometry. The course will also provide the basic knowledge about sample preparation, mass spectrometry workflow, different chromatography technologies and quantitative proteomics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Proteomics introduction and sample preparation\r\nLec 1: Introduction to proteomicsLec 2: Why proteomics and sample preparationLec 3: Protein extractionLec 4: In-gel &amp; in-solution digestionLec 5: Fundamentals of mass spectrometry\r\nWeek 2: Basics of mass spectrometry\r\nLec 6: Chromatography technologiesLec 7: Liquid chromatographyLec 8: Mass spectrometry: Ionization sourcesLec 9: Mass spectrometry: Mass analyzersLec 10: MALDI sample preparation and analysis\r\nWeek 3: Quantitative proteomics\r\nLec 11: Introduction to quantitative proteomicsLec 12: Hybrid mass spectrometry configurationsLec 13: SILAC: In vivo labelingLec 14: iTRAQ: In vitro labelingLec 15: TMT: In vitro labeling\r\nWeek 4: Proteomics and systems biology\r\nLec 16: Quantitative proteomics data analysisLec 17: Proteomics and systems biology-I Lec 18: Proteomics and systems biology-IILec 19: Proteomics applicationsLec 20: Challenges in proteomics\r\nÂ \n                                    ",
