In this biology course you will learn how the recognition of DNA as the genetic material and the ensuing identification of its structure and coding mechanism was both a revolutionary and foundational discovery. These discoveries led to transformational integration across the biological sciences with a common understanding of this fundamental unit of life!\n\nThe course utilizes video lectures, research articles, case studies, and molecular models to convey information. The course grade will be based on questions with each video lecture, quizzes, homework, and a final exam. \n\n                                    ",
