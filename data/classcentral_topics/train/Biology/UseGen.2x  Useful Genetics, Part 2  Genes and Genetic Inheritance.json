By the end of this course, you’ll be well prepared to deal with both today’s genetic issues and new questions that are sure to arise in the future.\n\nThis challenging but very rewarding course focuses on the genetics issues that impact our health and well-being, while providing the same rigorous examination of genetics principles as a college genetics course.\n\nThe course is taught in two parts. Part 2 consists of 5 modules followed by a final exam. You’ll learn how genes are passed from parents to child, and what you do and don’t inherit from your ancestors. You’ll be able to analyze family relationships and to evaluate and explain to others claims about GMOs, epigenetics and other controversial issues.\n\n                                    ",
