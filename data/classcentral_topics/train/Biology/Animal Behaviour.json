We evaluate the scientific rigour\nof studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods\nadopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        We will cover the following topics:Behaviour, Ecology and Natural SelectionGenes, Environment and LearningFinding food and avoiding predatorsCommunicationSexual selection and sperm competitionMating systems and sex allocationParental care and conflictSocial behaviour\n                                    ",
