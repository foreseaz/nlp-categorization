It is a disease that impacts on most people’s lives at some stage. So understanding cancer, and the development of new treatments, is of intrinsic interest to us all.\n\nThis free online course is open to anyone, although it is designed for individuals with a prior interest in biology, including current undergraduate students, and nurses or medics who want to further their knowledge in this area.\n\nOver six weeks, we will examine three key questions about cancer diagnosis and treatment:\n\n\n  Where have we come from?\n  Where are we now?\n  And where are we going?\n\n\nThe course will offer insights into patients’ experiences and enable discussions on key issues. Guest lecturers will include active researchers and those involved in direct patient care.\n\nYou will also get the chance to undertake your own internet-based investigation into one of the most exciting areas of cancer research.\n\nYou can read more about this course in Dr Leah Marks’ post for the FutureLearn blog: “New horizons: cancer and the genomic revolution.”\n\n\n\n                                    ",
