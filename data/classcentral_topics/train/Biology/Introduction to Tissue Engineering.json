Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    tissue101-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Tissue Engineering is a rapidly expanding field of applied biology and\n    biomedical engineering that aims to create artificial organs for transplantation,\n    basic research, or drug development. A fascinating aspect of the field\n    is the fundamental need to integrate knowledge of organic chemistry, cell\n    biology, genetics, mechanics and transport processes to create functional\n    organs. The process uncovers the fascinating complexity of living tissues,\n    and the joy of creation.  \nThis course will review basic cell culture techniques, structure function\n    relationships, cellular communication, natural and artificial biomaterials,\n    and the basic equations governing cell survival and tissue organization. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n \n  \n  Week One: Introduction. definitions, basic principles, structure-function relationshipsWeek Two: Biomaterials. metals, ceramics, polymers (synthetic and natural).
