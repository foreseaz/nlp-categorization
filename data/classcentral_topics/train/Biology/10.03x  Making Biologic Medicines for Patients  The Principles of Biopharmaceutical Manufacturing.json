Yet only recently have we begun to utilize cells as factories for the production of protein therapeutics.\n\nThese biologic drugs are able to treat otherwise untreatable diseases. In this course, you will learn how these life saving medicines are made.\n\nWe will connect the engineering fundamentals to real-world application by showing real pieces of biomanufacturing equipment in action and listening to experts describe real-world engineering challenges.\n\n                                    ",
