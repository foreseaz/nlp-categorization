Mobile Application Experiences Part 4: Understanding Use will teach you Human Computer Interaction (HCI) methods to understand current behavior in the domain, and then design, develop, and deploy your new application.\n\nThis module will explore how people use your mobile application in daily life, over an extended period of time.  You will deploy and run quantitative and qualitative studies of use to understand not only what users are doing, but how and why they are using your application the way that they are.\n\nThis course is part of a five-part Mobile Application Experiences series:\n\n21W.789.1x: Mobile Application Experiences Part 1: From a Domain to an App Idea\n\t21W.789.2x: Mobile Application Experiences Part 2: Mobile App Design\n\t21W.789.3x: Mobile Application Experiences Part 3: Building Mobile Apps\n\t21W.789.4x: Mobile Application Experiences Part 4: Understanding Use\n\t21w.789.5.x: Mobile Application Experiences Part 5: Reporting Research Findings\n\n\n                                    ",
