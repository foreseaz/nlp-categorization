In particular we make use of the Cordova hybrid application framework to develop and target multiple mobile platforms with a single codebase. We make use of the Ionic framework, one of fastest growing mobile application frameworks, that is built with mobile-optimized HTML5 and CSS based components and AngularJS. You will learn about UI development with Ionic and then using Cordova's modules to access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript. You should have already completed the Bootstrap and the AngularJS courses in this specialization before proceeding with this course. Alternately you should already have sufficient knowledge of Bootstrap and AngularJS before you proceed with this course.\n\nAt the end of this course you will be able to:\n\n- Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase\n- Leverage your HTML5, CSS, Javascript and AngularJS skills\n- Use various features of the Ionic framework to build hybrid mobile applications\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Hybrid Mobile App Development Frameworks: An IntroductionThis module introduces you to hybrid mobile application development. You will learn about the Ionic framework and explore some of the features of the Ionic framework to implement an Ionic app based on the AngularJS application that was implemented in the previous course on AngularJS.More Ionic CSS and JavaScriptThis module explores the Ionic support for forms. Advanced features of Ionic lists are discussed. In addition all the different methods of overlaying information on the screen like modals, popups, popovers, action sheets, and loading are examined. Ionic support for gestures is also briefly considered.Deploying your AppIn this module you will learn about Angular ui-router and the use of resolve. You will then learn about using local storage within your app. You will then learn about configuring your machine for building your app for various platforms, and deploying your app to emulators and devices.Accessing Native Capabilities of Devices: Cordova and ngCordovaIn this module you will explore Cordova and the ngCordova wrappers that enable you to access the native capabilities of the mobile devices. You will use a few plugins in order to understand the general concepts and the patterns for using these plugins within your Ionic application\n                                    ",
