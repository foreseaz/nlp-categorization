Within a guided tutorial process, create a simple app from beginning through to compilation that runs on a device.UIKit and the Interface BuilderHere we dive into layouts and some user interface elements.Advanced UI ConceptsHere we begin to really add elegance to our UIFinal Peer Assignment - App FunctionalityAt this point we have written the basic user interface for our image filtering app.  In this assignment you will implement remaining functionality, and then extend and refine the UI. For bonus marks you can try implementing a more advanced filter selection UI using the UICollectionView API.\n                                    ",
