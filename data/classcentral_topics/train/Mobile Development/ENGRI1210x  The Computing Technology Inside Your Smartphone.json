All of this is possible because a smartphone contains a powerful computer processor, which is the subject of this course. This computer science course starts by moving step-by-step through the fundamental layers of computing technology, from binary numbers to application software, and then covers advanced performance techniques and the details of actual smartphone processors.\n\nLearn about:\n\nDigital logic\n\tComputer organization\n\tInstruction sets\n\tApplication Software\n\tAdvanced performance techniques\n\tActual smartphone processors\nThis Course also provides students with the technical knowledge and the Jade design tool experience to succeed in the more advanced MITx 6.004 MOOC - Computation Structures course sequence.\n\n                                    ",
