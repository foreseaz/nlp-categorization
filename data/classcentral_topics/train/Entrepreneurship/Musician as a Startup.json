The truth is, if you want to become a full-time artist doing what you love, you have to structure a business around your art, not just merely hope!\r\nIn this practical, 8-week course, two full-time practitioner musicians and academic educators, Tommy Darker and Stereo Mike, will guide you though the process of creating your very own business model, how to market yourself as a startup, how to be agile, motivated and productive, how to develop a work-in-progress brand, and how to adapt to the new mindset.\r\nThis is a course for all artists, and 'music' will be used as a case study. You will learn through practical assignments, so that you can implement what you learn in the real world, and get practical results.\r\nThis is the first MOOC in the world of its kind. It will be exciting. Shall we start?\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: IntroductionHistorical Context | The New Ecosystem | Modern Concepts\r\nWeek 2 &amp; 3: Business ModelsBusiness Model Structure | Revenue models | Audience\r\nWeek 4: Lean StartupValidated Learning | MVP | Prototyping | Management\r\nWeek 5: Agile Philosophy PrinciplesProductivity &amp; Motivation | Startup Mindset | Communication\r\nWeek 6: Presence, Product, ProcessWork-in-progress Brand | Demo | The Drip Method\r\nWeek 7: Digital Opportunities &amp; Digital ParadigmsPower of Free | Digital-to-analogue | Network\r\nWeek 8: DeconstructionCase Studies | Leadership &amp; Innovation | What's Next?\n                                    ",
