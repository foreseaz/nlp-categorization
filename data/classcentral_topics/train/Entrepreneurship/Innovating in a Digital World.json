Yes, we’re always hearing about Google, Uber, and all those “pirate entrepreneurs.” Yes, we know technology has something to do with it. But the future is approaching even more quickly that we think. Right now, all the pieces are in place to completely change the face of products, technologies, organizations, and entrepreneurship over the next few years. This module will tell you how and why.Creating Value in a Digital WorldOnce upon a time, the rules of the game were simple. People worked away in their offices to develop and sell products or services, and shared the margin between price and cost. But now this product-based way of competing is all but gone – wiped out by the new principles of value creation. Going digital means playing by new rules, powered by network effects and system goods, that radically changed the fundamentals of business. Now, people create value outside their offices by connecting in third places, and the best way to turn a profit can be to give your products away, or share your knowledge, for free. Across the board, old-style value chains are being completely disrupted by new business ecosystems.Thinking and acting differentlyGoing digital is a bit like emigrating to another country. To succeed digitally, people and firms need to adopt a whole new mindset. Entrepreneurs should forget about building the perfect business plan, and instead put the focus on “trial and learn” processes. And companies should forget about long-term strategy, protecting their IP, product planning, and entry barriers, and concentrate on running instead of defending. This is true in every area from strategic decision-making through to getting the most from the assets that firms own, control, or use – knowledge assets in particular.Entrepreneurship in a Digital WorldWe usually think of the entrepreneur’s challenge as coming up with a “great idea.” But the new digital world doesn’t work on belief alone. Promises, and ideas’ potential, must be based on tangible facts. That’s why execution is so much more important than ideas. This module looks at the new context for entrepreneurs and the skills they need to succeed, including the supreme importance of execution, the key things every successful startup must do, and the essential skill of pitching ideas. \n                                    ",
