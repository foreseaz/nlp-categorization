It’s designed to be a sort of one-class business course for people who want to start startups.\r\nVideos of the lectures, associated reading materials, and assignments will all be available here. There will be 20 videos, some with a speaker or two and some with a small panel. It’ll be 1,000 minutes of content if you watch it all.\r\nWe’ll cover how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more.\r\nYou can’t teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising amount. We’ve tried to take some of the best speakers from the past 9 years of Y Combinator dinners and arrange them in a way that will hopefully make sense.\r\nWe’re doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone. It will hopefully be valuable even for people who don’t want to start startups.\r\nTalks like these have really helped Y Combinator founders create their companies. We hope you find it helpful too!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\nDate\r\nSpeaker\r\nTopic\r\n\r\n\r\n9/23/14\r\nSam Altman, President, Y Combinator \r\nWelcome, and Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n9/25/14\r\nSam Altman, President, Y Combinator \r\nIdeas, Products, Teams and Execution Part II\r\n\r\n\r\n9/30/14\r\nPaul Graham, Founder, Y Combinator \r\nHow to Have Ideas and How to Get Started\r\n\r\n\r\n10/2/14\r\nAdora Cheung, Founder, Homejoy \r\nBuilding Product, Talking to Users, and Growing\r\n\r\n\r\n10/7/14\r\nPeter Thiel, Founder, Paypal &amp; Palantir, and Partner, Founders Fund \r\nBusiness Strategy and Monopoly Theory\r\n\r\n\r\n10/9/14\r\nAlex Schultz, VP Growth, Facebook \r\nGrowth\r\n\r\n\r\n10/14/14\r\nKevin Hale, Founder, Wufoo and Partner, Y Combinator \r\nHow to Build Products Users Love, Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n10/16/14\r\nTBA \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n10/21/14\r\nMarc Andreessen, Founder, Andreessen Horowitz and Founder, Netscape Ron Conway, Founder, SV Angel Ben Silbermann, Founder &amp; CEO, Pinterest \r\nHow to Raise Money\r\n\r\n\r\n10/23/14\r\nAlfred Lin, Former COO, Zappos and Partner, Sequoia Capital \r\nCompany Culture and Buliding a Team, Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n10/28/14\r\nPatrick and John Collison,Founders, Stripe \r\nCompany Culture and Building a Team, Part II\r\n\r\n\r\n10/30/14\r\nAaron Levie, Founder, Box \r\nSales and Marketing\r\n\r\n\r\n11/4/14\r\nReid Hoffman, Partner, Greylock Ventures and Founder, LinkedIn \r\nTBA\r\n\r\n\r\n11/6/14\r\nKeith Rabois, Partner, Khosla Ventures \r\nHow to Operate\r\n\r\n\r\n11/11/14\r\nBen Horowitz, Founder, Andreessen Horowitz, and Founder, and Opsware \r\nHow to Manage\r\n\r\n\r\n11/13/14\r\nMarissa Mayer, CEO, Yahoo \r\nTBA\r\n\r\n\r\n11/18/14\r\nHosain Rahman, Founder, Jawbone \r\nHow to Build Products Users Love, Part II\r\n\r\n\r\n11/20/14\r\nKirsty Nathoo and Carolynn Levy, Partners, Y Combinator \r\nMechanics--Legal, Finance, HR, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n12/2/14\r\nTBA \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n12/4/14\r\nSam Altman, President, Y Combinator \r\nClosing Thoughts and Later-Stage Advice\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ",
