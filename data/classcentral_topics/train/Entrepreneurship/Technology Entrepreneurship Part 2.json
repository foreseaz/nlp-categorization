Last time, nearly 40,000 students from around the world participated and worked in teams together. The top teams were matched with Silicon Valley mentors, and the best teams at the end of the class pitched their ideas to investors. Many of the alumni of the last class are continuing to build their startups and will be mentoring teams this time. By the conclusion of the course, it is our hope that you understand how to: - Articulate a process for taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity (high performing students will be able to discuss the pros and cons of alternative theoretical models). - Create and verify a plan for gathering resources such as talent and capital. - Create and verify a business model for how to sell and market an entrepreneurial idea. - Generalize this process to an entrepreneurial mindset of turning problems into opportunities that can be used in larger companies and other settings.\n\n                                    ",
