At Acumen, we believe in giving the poor choice, not charity.  We envision low income people as consumers who can make their own decisions about the products and services needed to improve their lives.   At the same time,  social entrepreneurs need insights about why low income consumers often choose to adopt a new innovation. How can you design products and services that are incorporated into the daily lives of your customers?In this 2.5 hour course, you’ll learn about the 4A’s framework, a simple and practical model that can help you understand the drivers of adoption among base of the pyramid consumers: advantage, affordability, awareness and access.  Drawn from the “Growing Prosperity” report recently co-authored by Acumen and Bain &amp; Company, this tool will help you identify the most effective ways to increase the uptake of innovations among the poor.  \n\n                                    ",
