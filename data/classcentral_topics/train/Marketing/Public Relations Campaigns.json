In this section, I will be introducing you to Public Relations Campaigns. We will learn what Public Relations campaigns are, what a PR campaign looks like. Taking a historical stock-taking of campaigns, we will go on to grasp a flavor of campaigns from around the world. We will then discuss various categories of PR campaigns, and the features of these campaigns. Finally, we will also learn about the process of developing Public Relations Campaigns.Theories of CampaignsNow that we have had an overview of PR campaigns, let's explore some of the main theories of PR campaigns. We will learn about the role of theory as a conceptual map in guiding the development of campaigns. You will see how practical many of these theories are and the ways in which theories shape the selection of messages, source characteristics, appeals, and channels! In this section, I encourage you to keep thinking about the practical relevance of the theories you are picking up and the ways in which you might incorporate these theories when you start putting together campaigns.Campaign Design, Research, and ImplementationA strong Public Relations Campaign is based on the systematic development of objectives, strategies, and tactics. In this section, we will learn about the key elements of PR Campaign strategy and the role of research in guiding effective strategy. We will study the steps of PR planning and how to create a PR plan based on theoretically informed strategies and tactics. This is the fun part of the campaign process, and it is also the most challenging part as you have to make strategic decisions that are guided by research and are at the same time creative.\nEvaluation and Digital and Cultural TrendsEvery campaign must have a clear evaluation plan that tells the team and the management whether the campaign worked or not. In this section, we will learn about the various types of evaluation, and the ways in which we might put together these evaluation frameworks. Once we have discussed the evaluation framework, we will shift our attention to the digital and cultural trends in the campaign communication landscape.\n                                    ",
