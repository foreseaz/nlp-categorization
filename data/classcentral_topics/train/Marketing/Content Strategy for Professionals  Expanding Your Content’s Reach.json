At every level of for-profit, non-profit, volunteer and government enterprises, tens of thousands of professionals took that MOOC. They learned how Content Strategy uses credible, trustworthy, transparent content to communicate essential stories and information to important people inside and outside their organization.  \r\n \r\nIn this, the second Content Strategy MOOC, participants will go deeper. They will learn actionable ways to grow internal and external audiences.  They will deepen their understanding about those target individuals and will use a host of known and emerging tools and social networks to meaningfully reach them. They will also learn how to measure and improve the impact of their efforts with quantitative and qualitative metrics. As its name makes clear, this second Content Strategy MOOC will expand your content's impact and reach. \r\n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        To earn a Verified Certificate, learners must watch the MOOC's videos, answer the learning questions that accompany each video, participate in the discussion forums, develop and complete two case studies, and evaluate the cases of three other MOOC participants for each.\n                                    ",
