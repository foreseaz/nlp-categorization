We'll dissect the behavior of the players to understand their motivations to play for tens or hundreds of hours in the same game.\r\nWe then discuss the implementation of gamification with case studies of services that you will surely use it, and you did not know they were gamifiés. Finally, we will end up an ethical debate about the difference between motivation and manipulation, and how to not fall to the dark side of the force (although there, they have cookies).\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\nRecommended:\r\n\r\nGood knowledge of marketing\r\nGood knowledge of the ecosystem of applications (mobile and web)\r\n\r\n\n\n                                    ",
