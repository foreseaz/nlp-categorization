In this course we intend to introduce some of the basic concepts of machine learning from a mathematically well motivated perspective. We will cover the different learning paradigms and some of the more popular algorithms and architectures used in each of these paradigms. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introductory TopicsWeek 2: Linear Regression and Feature SelectionWeek 3: Linear ClassificationWeek 4: Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural NetworksWeek 5: Bayesian Learning and Decision TreesWeek 6: Evaluation MeasuresWeek 7: Hypothesis TestingWeek 8: Ensemble MethodsWeek 9: ClusteringWeek 10: Graphical ModelsWeek 11: Learning Theory and Expectation MaximizationWeek 12: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\r\n \n                                    ",
