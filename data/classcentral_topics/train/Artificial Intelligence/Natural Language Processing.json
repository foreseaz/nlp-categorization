Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin. Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    nlp\n                                                                    nlp-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This course covers a broad range of topics in natural language processing, including word and sentence tokenization, text classification and sentiment analysis, spelling correction, information extraction, parsing, meaning extraction, and question answering, We will also introduce the underlying theory from probability, statistics, and machine learning that are crucial for the field, and cover fundamental algorithms like n-gram language modeling, naive bayes and maxent classifiers, sequence models like Hidden Markov Models, probabilistic dependency and constituent parsing, and vector-space models of meaning.\nWe are offering this course on Natural Language Processing free and online to students worldwide, continuing Stanford's exciting forays into large scale online instruction. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. Taught by Professors Jurafsky and Manning, the curriculum draws from Stanford's courses in Natural Language Processing. You will need a decent internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone. \n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The following topics will be covered in the first two weeks:\n\nIntroduction and Overview:\nBasic Text Processing: J+M Chapters 2.1, 3.9; MR+S Chapters 2.1-2.2\nMinimum Edit Distance: J+M Chapter 3.11\nLanguage Modeling: J+M Chapter 4\nSpelling Correction: J+M Chapters 5.9, Peter Norvig (2007) How to Write a Spelling Corrector\n\n\n                                    ",
