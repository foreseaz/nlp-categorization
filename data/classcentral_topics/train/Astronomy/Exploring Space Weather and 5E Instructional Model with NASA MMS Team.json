To prepare and teach middle school students how to quickly and efficiently monitor progress of an entire solar storm from the time it erupts from the sun and magnetic field. To do this, participants will engage in the following activities.\r\n\r\nPredict which sunspots may be a source of solar storms and identify this within an online learning platform.\r\nDiscover when solar storms occur and predict which solar storms will affect Earth in an online learning community.\r\nMeasure disturbances of Earthâ€™s magnetic field and predict auroras.\r\nIdentify when aurora viewing is most desirable.\r\nCreate an object to teach the local community about solar storm weather reports employing a monitoring system already developed.\r\n\r\n2. To generate interest among students, teachers, and stakeholder in STEM careers in relation to solar storms and the study of heliophysics using a real world scenario and event.\r\n3. To assist in the development of STEM elementary and middle school programs via the arts through the construction of a learning artifact or object that can be shared with a wider learning community.\n\n                                    ",
