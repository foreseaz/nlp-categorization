Pick one from below:\n                                                                    astrotech-001\n                                                                    astrotech-002\n                                                                    astrotech-003\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one.

But\n    how do we know all that? The truth is that astronomy would be impossible without technology, and every advance in astronomy is really an advance in technology. But the technology by itself is not enough. We have to apply it critically with a knowledge\n    of physics to unlock the secrets of the Universe.\n    Each week we will cover a different aspect of Astronomical technology, matching each piece of technology to a highlight science result.   We will explain how the technology works, how it has allowed us to collect astronomical data, and, with\n    some basic physics, how we the interpret the data to make scientific discoveries. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week-1 - Science and Technology :\na marriage made in Heaven\n\n  Our Knowledge of the Universe  Revolutions in Astronomy  Why Astronomy is hard  The Horse and the Cart\n\n \n\nWeek-2 - Telescopes : Picturing\nthe Universe\n\n  Example story : we are stardust   The technology : how telescopes\nwork   Putting it together : we are\nstardust part II    Big Telescopes of the future \n\n \n\nWeek-3 - Space : Getting above it\nall\n\n  Example story : hunting for\nblack holes   The technology : rockets,\nspacecraft, and orbits   Putting it together : hunting\nfor black holes part II  The future : can space missions get\ncheaper? \n\n  \n\nWeek-4 - Detectors : Catching the light from the stars \n\n  Example story : galaxies from\nthe dawn of time   The technology : CCDs and\ninfra-red arrays  Putting it together : galaxies\nfrom the dawn of time part II  Is there another revolution in\ndetector technology?\n\n \n\nWeek-5 - Computers : Crunching the data  Example story : killer rocks   The technology : computers, databases\nand the internet  Putting it together : killer\nrocks part II   The future : hitting the\nbuffers?\n\n \n\nWeek-6 - Spectrographs : Taking the fingerprints of the stars\n\n  Example story : the accelerating\nuniverse and dark energy   The technology : how\nspectrographs work   Putting it together : dark\nenergy part II   The perfect spectrograph? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ",
