The goal of particle physics is to study the elementary particles\nmaking up the world and their interactions. The development of particle physics\nchanged our view of nature greatly in the past century. In this course, we will\nintroduce the history of particle physics, main ideas and the most recent\nresults of this subject. This course is an elective course for those students\nwho might be interested in research in particle physics. It can also be useful\nfor any undergraduate who have taken general physics courses and want to get an\ninsight into the nature deeply.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        第一周\n物质与反物质\n\n第二周\n夸克和强相互作用\n\n第三周\n弱相互作用和中微子\n\n第四周\n对称性\n\n第五周\n粒子的质量和希格斯粒子\n\n第六周\n标准模型\n\n第七周\n粒子天体物理\n\n第八周\n暗物质和暗能量\n                                    ",
