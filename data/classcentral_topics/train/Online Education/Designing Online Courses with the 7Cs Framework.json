This framework was proposed by Prof Gráinne Conole. It combines the Open University’s Learning Design Initiative with the Carpe Diem learning design workshops of the University of Leicester.In this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), you will work on the design (or redesign!) of a technologically enhanced course. You will find a series of activities to guide you through the learning design process. If you want to complete all the activities, you will need 2-3 hours per week. This MOOC has 6 lessons. Every lesson is divided into units, which have a recommended study time of approximately 30 minutes each. You can do additional readings and activities to expand upon some of the topics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1 - Overview of the 7Cs Framework Lesson 2 - Your CourseLesson 3 - Conceptualise and CreateLesson 4 - Communicate and CollaborateLesson 5 - Consider and CombineLesson 6 - Consolidate the Course\n                                    ",
