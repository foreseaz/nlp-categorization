It will challenge you take control of your own learning, to determine your own personal learning objectives, to contribute to the development of the curriculum, to reflect on your progress, to learn new digital skills, and to take a leadership role in the virtual classroom. It will also provide you with the opportunity to connect with colleagues from different countries and professions, and to better understand areas where your interests overlap and where unexpected distinctions exist. We hope you’ll consider taking this journey with us.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to Open KnowledgeWeek 2: Technological Change, Digital Identity, and Connected LearningWeek 3: Participatory Culture, Citizen Journalism, Citizen ScienceWeek 4: Intellectual Property, Copyright, and the Economics of OpenWeek 5: Historical Perspectives: Learned Publishing from Medieval to Modern TimesWeek 6: Open Science, Data, Access, Source, ReviewWeek 7: Open Educational Resources: From Lesson Plans to Instructional VideosWeek 8: Archives, Databases, Encyclopedia: Evaluating Open Collections and Reference SourcesWeek 9: Scholarly Publishing and Communications: Journals, Books, and Publication of ResearchWeek 10: Information Literacy: Overload, Filters, and Developing a Critical LensWeek 11: Global Perspectives on Equity, Development, and Open KnowledgeWeek 12: Student Publishing: Lessons in Publishing, Peer Review, and Knowledge SharingWeek 13: The Future of Open Knowledge\n                                    ",
