Participants will explore online teaching in the very environment that their future students will be experiencing. Participants will understand online learning processes, how to promote interactive work and critical thinking, re-design learning activities, effectively manage the online classroom, and assess the online studentâ€™s work. Both synchronous and asynchronous modes will be addressed. This course is a non-technical introduction to teaching online; participants should already be familiar with a course management system. This course is geared towards   -time online instructors.\n\n                                    ",
