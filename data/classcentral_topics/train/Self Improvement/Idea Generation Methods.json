Idea generation is part of the fuzzy front end of the innovation process. Because of the close collaboration between KIT and KIC InnoEnergy, participants have the possibility to work on specific innovation topics in the area of sustainable energy.\r\nDr. Daniel Jeffrey Koch will impart a broadly diversified knowledge of the methods used in idea generation. Moreover, Felix Teufel and his colleague Dominic Buchholz (both from the Business Innovation sector in KIC InnoEnergy) will assume a supporting role in the course to present the topics innovation and idea generation from a practical view.\r\nThe course language is English, and the workload is about 4h/week.\r\nThe aim of the course is to enable participants to apply methods of idea generation on their own project. Besides explaining these methods to other participants, it is also expected that participants develop a self-chosen idea.\r\nWhat do I learn\r\nParticipants will be able to understand and apply certain methods of idea generation on any self chosen topic. For example, they will understand and apply methods such as Mindmapping &amp; Clustering, 6-3-5, World Cafe &amp; DeBono Hats, Concept Mapping, Scenario Techniques ( e.g. STEEP), Roadmapping and many more - always in a structured process.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 1       Introduction: Get the picture out of your head!Strategic Innovation Management, Idea Generation Process, Innovation Process and fuzzy front end\r\nChapter 2       Design FactorsWhat's in your picture?  Design Aspects, Methods, Sources\r\nChapter 3       Defining your Search SpaceLandscape or portrait?  Context Definition, Agenda Setting, Problem Representation\r\nChapter 4       ScenarioWhat's my perspective?  Definition of Scenario Topic, STEEP / PESTEL Analysis, Influence Factors and Descriptors\r\nChapter 5       Future Assumptions: Using watercolour or oil? Present Situation and Future Assumptions, Bundling Projection, Interpretation of Scenario, Wild Cards, SWOT, Proposals for Action\r\nChapter 6       Scenario based RoadmappingWhat to draw when?  Definition of a Roadmapping Topic, Needs Analysis, Analysis of Potentials\r\nChapter 7       Establishing your roadmapSketching your picture! Establishing a Roadmap, Consistency Analysis and Evaluation\n                                    ",
