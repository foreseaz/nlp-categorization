Their STEAM CAMP incorporated NASA MMS Challenge curriculum, authored by Jennifer Miller, Sandra Wozniak, and Tom Chambers, along with other NASA MMS fabrication resources.\r\nTo be successful in this course, participants should plan to spend approximately 3 hours per week completing activities and interacting with others. The primary audience for this course are those who wish to conduct their own STEAM Camp or after school STEAM program.\r\nThis MOOC consists of five one-week modules full of NASA MMS student resources that can be used during STEAM related educational experiences.
