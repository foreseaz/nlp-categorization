Intended for educators from all disciplines, Tinker, Make &amp; Learn builds upon the experiential approach to learning through a blended model. It delves into activity-based strategies that will help empower participants in their own learning. The course is not just to teach making, but is an exemplar of an exciting blended learning course. The interactive methods in the course promote an open-ended, two-way exchange of ideas. Activities will be introduced each week that engage a specific set of making skills.\n\n                                    ",
