One day it’s scary bacteria in meat, and another day it’s dangerous pesticides in fruits. According to some, meat needs to be cooked well to prevent food-borne illness while others warn not to heat food to prevent the formation of poisonous substances.\n\nMany consumers worry about the conflicting and confusing messages about food hazards\n\nThis nutrition and health course will teach you about the hazards associated with food and give you the tools to assess the dangers they can present. You will learn the effects of food processing, the shared responsibility in the food chain and the prevention of food poisoning/intoxication. After this course, you will be able to differentiate what is a food myth vs. an actual risk. Finally, you will gain a contemporary view of how different risks can be weighed.\n\nThis course is part of the Nutrition-Food for Health XSeries.\n\n                                    ",
