It illustrates theories about people's individual decisions to migrate and also the factors of migration as a structural feature of our societies. It explains the role social networks and institutions play in making people move to another country, or return to their own. Finally, it includes interviews with international experts that describe how migration theories can help to understand some topical case studies of labour migrations in the world.\r\nThe course is based on video lectures, didactic videos and podcast interviews with international experts. Assignments consist of short quizzes for each unit and a journal exercise at the end of the course. Suggestions for further reading will be included in order to achieve a more in-depth understanding.\r\nTo learn more about irregular migration and asylum seeking, check out Part 1: Facts\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        CHAPTER 1 – MIGRATION AS A GLOBAL PHENOMENONUnit 1.1 – Migration in human historyUnit 1.2 – Contemporary trends\r\nCHAPTER 2 - WHY MIGRATION STARTS?Unit 2.1 – Migration as a choiceUnit 2.2 – Migration as a consequence\r\nCHAPTER 3 – WHY MIGRATION CONTINUES?Unit 3.1 – The importance of networksUnit 3.2 – The role of institutionsUnit 3.2 – Return migration\r\nCHAPTER 4 – EXAMPLESUnit 5.1 – Migration and development in AfricaUnit 5.2 – Care and domestic workers in ItalyUnit 5.4 – Indian migrants in Gulf region\n                                    ",
