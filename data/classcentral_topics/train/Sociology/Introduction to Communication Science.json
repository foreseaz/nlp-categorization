We need to interact with people around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world.\n\nIntroduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through communication. \n\nUpon completion of this course, students should:\n•\thave knowledge of the history and development of communication science; \n•\thave knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; \n•\thave knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. \n\nBeginning the week of February 16, 2015, you will be able to join Signature Track, a system that verifies your identity when you take an exam. This option will allow you to earn a Verified Certificate, which provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Amsterdam logo.

Also, they explore the historical roots of the science of communication. I will discuss the development of communication theory and the evolution of the media landscape in Antiquity, Medieval and Early Modern times.Technical Approaches to Communication ScienceThe linear effect-oriented approach is discussed and how it developed in the twentieth century. Evolving from a belief in all-powerful effects after World War I to a more nuanced negotiated effects perspective in the sixties.Cultural and Social Approaches to Communication ScienceThis covers theoretical approaches that understand communication processes as social and cultural forces, as building blocks of reality, and a binding element of power in society.Final Exam\n                                    ",
