Pick one from below:\n                                                                    wrongfulconviction-001\n                                                                    wrongfulconviction-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    According to\nthe National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of Michigan Law and\nNorthwestern Law, over 1,600 individuals in the United States have been\nexonerated after being convicted for crimes they did not commit. These are the\nknown cases of wrongful conviction—the actual number is much higher. Some of\nthese individuals have served years, even decades, in prison for these\ncrimes. Often, real offenders\nhave escaped justice as a result of the wrong person being accused and convicted. \n\nAs noted, we\nwill approach this topic from a social scientific perspective. Social science\nis a broad field that seeks to understand social interactions between\nindividuals, groups, and institutions. The field includes academic disciplines\nsuch as sociology, criminology, psychology, economics, anthropology, political\nscience, and other related disciplines. \n\nIn this\ncourse we will explore wrongful convictions answering several key questions:\n\n\n What do we mean by\n     “wrongfully convicted,” and how common are wrongful convictions?\n Who are wrongfully\n     convicted?\n Where in the\n     criminal justice system do things go wrong to lead to wrongful\n     convictions?\n Why do wrongful\n     convictions occur? \n How can social\n     science contribute to understanding, and preventing wrongful convictions?\n\n For-credit option:This course will also be offered for Penn State credit.  This course option will require a heavier workload and offer instructor feedback and assessment on completed work.

Each lesson, while related, will be considered independently.\n\nWeek One:\nIntroduction to the Criminal Justice System\nSocial Science and Public Policy: Due Process and Crime Control\n\nWeek Two: \nWrongful Conviction Defined\nWrongful Conviction Demographics and Statistics\n\nWeek Three: \nWrongful Conviction and the Criminal Justice Process—Where do things go wrong?\nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: Eyewitness Misidentification—An Introduction\n\nWeek Four: \nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: Eyewitness Misidentification—System Variables\nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: Eyewitness Misidentification—Estimator Variables\n\nWeek Five: \nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: False Confessions\nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: Jailhouse Snitches and Informants\n\nWeek Six: \nCauses of Wrongful Conviction: Government Misconduct and Poor Defense\nMyths and Misconceptions of Decision-Makers: Judges, Juries, and the Public\n\nWeek Seven: \nUsing Social Science to Prevent Wrongful Convictions\nWhat can you do?\n                                    ",
