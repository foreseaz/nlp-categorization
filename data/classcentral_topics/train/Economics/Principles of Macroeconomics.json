Macroeconomics\nis a word derived from the Greek prefix “makros”, meaning large. It is the study\nof economic aggregates, of national and international economies and of the\neconomic management role played by governments and international organisations.\n\n\nThe founder of\nmodern macroeconomics, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, famously wrote\n“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right\nand when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,\nthe world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be\nquite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some\ndefunct economist.” This will be the key theme we explore in the course, the\ninfluence of theory and the way that policy responses to events like recession,\nunemployment, inflation and the Global Financial Crisis, reflect that theory.\n\nWe will cover\nimportant macroeconomic concepts such as the national accounts, unemployment\nand inflation, explain how the ideas associated with John Maynard Keynes laid\nthe foundation for governments’ active management of the macroeconomy in the\npost war era, and examine the intellectual basis for the monetary and fiscal\npolicy responses to the Global Financial Crisis.  Economists’ approaches to the analysis of\nlong run economic growth will also be considered. The approach will be\ncritical. There are few areas of human endeavour that attract so much debate\nand disagreement as the management of a modern industrial economy. We will not\nshy away from those debates. But what we will do is emphasise the systematic\ntheorising that underlies the way macroeconomists and policy makers approach\ntheir task. The aim is to enable those who take the course to become informed\nanalysts of the macroeconomy and of current (and past) macroeconomic policy\ndebates.Image source: Nilss Olekalns University of Melbourne 2012\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The overall aim of this subject is to provide an introduction to macroeconomic theory and policy, economic aggregates such as aggregate production and employment, the general level of prices and inflation, the exchange rate, the volume of money and the balance of payments. Analysis is particularly directed to models of an open economy and to current economic problems and policy issues.\n                                    ",
