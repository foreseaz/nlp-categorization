Analyzing the choices made by these economic agents is one of the main subjects of microeconomics.\n\nIn this economics and finance course, you will learn how the decisions made by economic agents are represented in the market as demand and supply of commodities. You will also learn about equilibriums in the market, which is when the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. The derivation of this equilibrium is another main focus of microeconomics. By deriving an equilibrium in a market, we can see at which level the price will be and how much of a transaction will occur.\n\nSince this is an introductory economics course at the most elementary level, no prior knowledge of economics is needed. Anyone who is interested in economics is welcome to take this course.\n\n                                    ",
