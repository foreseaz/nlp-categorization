Emphasis is on the nature and functions of product markets, the theory of the firm under varying conditions of competition and monopoly, and the role of government in promoting efficiency in the economy.\n\nMost people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study of money.  My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief. During this course, we will be addressing the above questions as well as many more relating to:\n\n\nthe environment\nlove and marriage\ncrime\nlabor markets\neducation\npolitics\nsports\nbusiness\n\n\nMy main goal is to show you the way economists think and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related not only to these and other important human issues, but to anything you end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will quickly find out, I believe that everything is economics!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course will be broken up into 8 modules covering the following topics:\n\nModule 1: Basic Concepts, Modeling, and Trade\nModule 2: Supply and Demand\nModule 3: Market Efficiency and Government Intervention\nModule 4: Elasticity and Taxes\nModule 5: Production and Costs\nModule 6: Competitive Output\nModule 7: Firms With Market Power\nModule 8: Public Goods, Common Resources, and Externalities\n \n                                    ",
