With this in mind, this second module of the Power of Markets course addresses how firms can most effectively convert inputs into final output and then covers determining the best price-output combination for a firm and how this varies depending on whether the firm is operating in a perfectly competitive or imperfectly competitive market setting.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 5 - ProductionThe Production Process: How Firms Convert Inputs into Final Outputs.Week 6 - Cost MinimizationHow Firms Minimize the Cost of Producing Output.Week 7 - Profit Maximization in Perfectly Competitive MarketsHow Firms Maximize Profits in Perfectly Competitive Markets.Week 8 - Monopoly Power:  Its Sources and How to Use ItThe Sources and Uses of Monopoly Power.\n                                    ",
