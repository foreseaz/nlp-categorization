By applying the concepts learned in this course to current public health problems and issues, students will  understand the practice of epidemiology as it relates to real life and makes for a better appreciation of public health programs and policies. This course explores public health issues like cardiovascular and infectious diseases – both locally and globally – through the lens of epidemiology.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course Introduction, History of Epidemiology and Epidemiology ResearchThis module introduces the history and field of epidemiology.Understanding Measures of Disease FrequencyThis module introduces measures of disease frequency.Study DesignsThis module introduces the following study designs: experimental, cohort, case control, cross-sectional, and ecologic.Measures of AssociationThis module introduces measures of association and confidence intervals.CausalityThis module introduces causality.Course ConclusionThis module concludes the course. \n                                    ",
