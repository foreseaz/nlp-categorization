Part 2 helped you prepare for your departure and rotations, and how to handle on-the-ground situations and assess information.\n\nIn Part 3 you will learn how to identify and explain components of “reverse culture shock” upon returning from a global health experience, how to identify strategies for effectively “reintegrating” into your home and work life upon returning from a global health experience, and how to effectively manage potential health issues upon returning from a global health experience.\n\nIn addition, you’ll learn how to effectively advocate for other individuals at your institution to identify clinical opportunities, educational opportunities and funding structures for future global health experiences.\n\nCompletion of The Practitioner’s Guide to Global Health - Part 1: The Big Picture and The Practitioner’s Guide to Global Health - Part 2: Preparation and On The Ground is required.    \n\n                                    ",
