Pick one from below:\n                                                                    socialepi-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad\nperspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such\nas familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces\n-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing\nevidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant\nto the topic.\n\nThe course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental\ncauses of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.\nFor example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people\ndifferently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is\na narrowly defined medical problem.\n\nStudents in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,\nand complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability\nto synthesize ideas.\n\nUpon completion of the course students should:\n\n\n    have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health\n        of populations,\n    be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature\n        that address the causes of disease,\n    be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status,\n        and \n    be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical\n        for policy making.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:  Background and History\nWhat is social epidemiology and where did it come from?
