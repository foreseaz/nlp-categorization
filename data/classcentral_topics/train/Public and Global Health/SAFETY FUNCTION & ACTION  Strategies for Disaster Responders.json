SAFETY, FUNCTION, ACTION is a framework of six strategies for achieving and maintaining a high level of disaster health and well being. “Disaster health” was introduced as a concept and discipline in Homeland Security Presidential Directive-21 (HSPD-21). SAFETY, FUNCTION, ACTION defines “disaster health” as, “Maximal    in situations of threat, optimal function in situations of high stress, and effective action in response to emergencies, disasters, and extreme events.” To remain congruent with HSPD-21, SAFETY, FUNCTION, ACTION integrates elements of disaster medical care, public health, and behavioral health within a single framework.\r\n\r\nThis course is dually focused on disaster responders and the disaster survivors they serve. As a result, the framework also introduces two skill sets: a \"\"PREPARE\"\" skill set focused on responders, and a \"\"RESPOND\"\" skill set focused on support for survivors.\n\n                                    ",
