It provides an opportunity to examine contemporary interpretations of health inequalities and related concepts like justice, fairness and equity. We discuss how different approaches to measuring, defining and monitoring health inequalities are influenced by social and political factors and how this, in turn, shapes strategies for addressing such inequalities.\n\n                                    ",
