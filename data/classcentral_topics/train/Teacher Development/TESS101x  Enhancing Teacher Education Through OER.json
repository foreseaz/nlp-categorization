Achieving this aspiration demands highly skilled teachers and quality teacher education. \n \nThis course introduces teacher educators to Open Educational Resources – freely available learning materials that can be adapted for use in particular contexts.  The course explores how you can use OER in the design and delivery of your teacher education programmes to help you bring about the transformation of classroom teaching and learning.   Throughout the course there will be a particular focus on the OER generated by TESS- India. These innovative multi-lingual text and video OER (www.tess-india.edu.in) aim to support teachers in developing participatory approaches through modelling links between theory and practice in classroom activities.   You will explore the values and pedagogy underpinning teacher education OER from TESS-India and other repositories and learn how you can adapt and incorporate these OER for your own contexts and students. \n \nThrough participation in the course you will develop skills in locating, adapting and producing OER. Collaboration and the co-creation of OER will be key themes; you will be introduced to ways of working and open practices that you will be able to take forward into your professional working.  Through the course you may also form and strengthen your professional support network of fellow teacher educators. \n \nThe course is designed primarily for teacher educators working in the Indian context in both pre-service and in-service education with primary and secondary school teachers in formal and informal programmes. However it has significant application for teacher educators globally. \n\nAll course content is openly licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license.
