Starting from mistake approaches from structuralism, error analysis, Montessori to Freinet, we develop an approach that applauds the mistakes being made as they allow us to create this new way of learning. Mistakes are pathways to new strategies. These will be described and remediated in lay terms. Teachers and learners learn how to create knowledge clips based on digital storytelling; gather Guerrilla paths through narrative coaching, graphic facilitation, human-centred design, art of hosting and formulate and apply Guerrilla patterns in Communities of Practice.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1 - Introduction: London trip as Guerrilla learningLesson 2 - Susan goes searching for her studentsLesson 3 - Susan takes actionLesson 4 - Susan appreciates all her students\n                                    ",
