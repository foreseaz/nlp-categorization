The diseases are neglected because they affect the poorest people on the planet; because wealthy countries are largely unaffected; because they are fundamentally difficult to research; and because they tend to cause ill-health rather than death. NTDs include the diseases caused by the parasitic worms whipworm, hookworm, schistosomes, and tapeworms. Education has a key role to play in reducing the prevalence and associated ill health caused by these worms. This course describes the four parasitic worms in detail and explains how we get infected.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nTo gain an understanding of how each parasitic worm infects people.\r\nTo understand how infection can be prevented.\r\nTo explore the global health importance of each parasite.\r\n\n\n                                    ",
