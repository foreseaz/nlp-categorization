Next, we consider the consequences of the disease for individuals and examine specific strategies for helping people remain engaged and with quality of life. We then focus on the impact of the disease on family members, communities and societies at large.  Theoretical and practical frameworks are discussed to help inform ways to support and care for individuals \"living with\" dementia and their caregivers.Health professionals and students, family caregivers, friends of patients, and others interested in learning about dementia and quality care will acquire in this five-week course foundational knowledge in the care of persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and other neurocognitive disorders. Through course exercises and on-line discussions with others, you will have the opportunity to identify the prevalence of dementia in your country, consider the resources available to advance a meaningful approach to support families contending with this disease, and exchange ideas concerning care strategies in various settings such as the home, community and social service agencies, hospitals or other clinical settings\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK I: The BrainFramework of Dementia Global impact of dementia History of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Pathophysiology of DementiaThe New Trajectory of DementiaThe Challenge of DiagnosisWEEK 2: The PersonPersonhood of Individuals with Dementia Unmet NeedsUnmet Needs: Continuum of Needs of Persons with Dementia and Potential Interventions Behaviors, Trajectory and Change Over Time of DementiaAssessing the Role of the Home and Community Environment in Supporting Families Living with DementiaActivity for Persons with Dementia Palliative Care Pharmacological Treatment Options WEEK 3: The Caregiving and the Home Environment  Family Unmet NeedsPsychosocial Processes Environmental Model The Role of Technology in Dementia CareWEEK 4: The Community Level Dementia Friendly Communities It Takes a Team: The Role of the Interprofessional Team in a Collaborative Care ModelWEEK 5: Overview of National Plans and Policies National Plans and Policies Assessing Dimensions of Comprehensive Dementia Care Q &amp; A \"Ask us anything\"\n                                    ",
