Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin. Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    fog-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Pushing computation, control and storage into the “cloud” has been a key trend in\nnetworking in the past decade. The cloud is now “descending” to the network\nedge and often diffused among the client devices in both mobile and wireline\nnetworks. The cloud is becoming the “fog.” Empowered by the latest chips,\nradios, and sensors, each client device today is powerful in computation, in\nstorage, in sensing and in communication. Yet client devices are still limited\nin battery power, global view of the network, and mobility support. Most\ninterestingly, the collection of many clients in a crowd presents a highly\ndistributed, under-organized, and possibly dense network. \n\nFog Networking is an architecture that will also support the Internet of Things, IoT, such as the “connected wearables.” Bold, new user interfaces are getting close to affordable price points for the mass, begging questions on the “architectural choices for the glasses and watches,” from naming to billing, and from session management to resource optimization. Fog Networking leverages past experience in sensor networks, P2P and MANET research, and incorporates the latest advances in devices, network systems, and data science to reshape the “balance of power” in the ecosystem of computing and networking. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Overview: From Cloud to FogOverview: From IT to loTPrinciples of Edge/P2P networkingSmart data pricing for new network servicesClient side control and configurationClient-side measurement &amp; Control SignalingEdge resource pooling and cachingSecurity and privacy in FogConsumer and wearable IoTConnected cars IoTSmart grids IoTHealthcare IoT \n                                    ",
