Therefore,\nhow to carry out the reflective judgment on the media and information is\nthe main problem of media criticism which still remains to be solved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedia criticism refers to reflective judgment, which bases on the\ncriticism of the value standpoint, the dissemination of the concept and\nthe theory background. Media criticism is the observation, analysis,\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tevaluation, which is concluded from the humanities and social science\nfundamental research method, to the political and economy mechanism of\nmedia, mass communication media agencies and media practitioners, the\nbasic form, media products, media text and the content, the audience.
