Writing is often seen as something we do in order to remember grammatical forms and words to learn. However, I'd argue that we need grammar and words in order to write. Writing is becoming increasingly important as we communicate even more online. And increasingly we have to communicate with people from other countries. This means that we have to be able to express our ideas clearly and in a way that people can understand. If you want to get more information on writing, this is the course for you. Writing is a process and simply taking this course will NOT make you a great writer over night. It's hard work and takes practice. What I hope for this course is that it will give you some easy tips to help move your writing in a positive direction. That said, you will still need help with your writing, so where possible, ask someone to help check and proof read your work.\n\n                                    ",
