Writers cannot write for a single language community anymore but must be aware of, and consider how to prepare and write for multiple languages to reach diverse populations, cultures, and communities.\r\nThis course will focus on how to apply best practices for:\r\n\r\nGlobalization - the broad range of processes necessary to prepare and launch products and company activities internationally.\r\nInternationalization - developing content that is easily localized; doesn’t include local/regional references.\r\nLocalization - the process of adapting a product or service to a particular language and culture.\r\n\r\nIn addition, writers must also be aware of the industry’s standards to help manage this activity, including an understanding of:\r\n\r\nMachine translation (MT)\r\nTranslation memory (TM)\r\nTranslation Management Systems (TMS)\r\nContent management systems (CMS)\r\n\n\n                                    ",
