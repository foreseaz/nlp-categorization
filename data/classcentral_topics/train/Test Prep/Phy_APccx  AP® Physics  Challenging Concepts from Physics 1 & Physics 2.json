Well-respected AP instructors from around the United States will lead you through video instruction, exam-style questions and interactive activities.\n\nEach module will cover one of the most demanding concepts in the newly redesigned AP® Physics 1 &amp; 2 curricula (based on College Board data from 2011–2013 AP® Physics B exams).\n\nThese tricky topics are broken into bite-sized pieces—with short instructional videos, on-screen simulations, interactive graphs, and practice problems written by many of the same people who write and grade your AP® Physics 1 &amp; 2 exams.\n\nTopics include:\n\nP1: Acceleration\n\tP1: Force Diagrams\n\tP1: Momentum\n\tP1: Rotational Motion\n\tP1: Angular Momentum\n\tP1: Standing Waves\n\tP1: Conservation of Charge &amp; Energy in Circuits\n\tP2: Electrostatic Fields\n\tP2: Gravitational and Electric Potentials\n\tP2: Electromagnetic Induction\n\tP2: Thermodynamics\n\tP2: Pressure, Force &amp; Flow in Fluids\n\tP2: Diffraction &amp; Interference\n\tP2: Atomic Transitions\nThis course is specifically designed for blended learning in AP classrooms, but can also be used by AP students independently as supplementary help and exam review.\n\n \n\nAdvanced Placement® and AP® are trademarks registered and/or owned by the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\n                                    ",
