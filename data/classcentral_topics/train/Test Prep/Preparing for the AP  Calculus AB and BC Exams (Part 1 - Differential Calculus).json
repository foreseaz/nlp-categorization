There will also be\nan extensive online quiz given each week, with multiple problem versions\nthat students can use to practice, along with practice tests to help\nstudents prepare for the AP* Calculus AB Exam.\n\n* AP Calculus is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not\ninvolved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 - Limits and Continuity: limits of functions, asymptotic behavior, unbounded\nbehavior, continuity properties of functions, the intermediate value theorem, limits of trigonometric functions and the extreme value theorem.           Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes Week 2 - Derivatives of Polynomials and Trigonometric Functions, Chain Rule, Higher Order\nDerivatives, and Implicit Differentiation: definition and concept of the derivative, derivative\nrules, higher order derivatives,interpretation of the derivative, chain rule,\nimplicit differentiation.         Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes \n\nWeek 3 - Applications of the Derivative: related rates, velocity/acceleration, Mean\nValue Theorem, intervals of increase/decrease, extreme values, concavity, points of Inflection and curve sketching.          Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes\n\nWeek 4 - Transcendental Functions: inverse functions, exponential and natural logarithm functions, inverse trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions.          Assessments: Practice Problems and Quizzes\n\n\n\nWeek 5 - Further Applications of the Derivative: optimization, differentials L'Hospital's Rule.           Assessments: Practice Problems and QuizzesWeek 6 - Practice AB Exam                                                                                            Assessments: Two exams\n\n\n                                    ",
