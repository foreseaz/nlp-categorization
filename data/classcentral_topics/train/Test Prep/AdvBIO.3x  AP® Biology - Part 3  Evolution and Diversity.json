You will examine how changes in the genetic makeup of a population happen over time and how these changes drive evolution and create diversity.\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP Biology teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems.  By the end of the course, you will be prepared to take on the AP exam!\n\n \n\nThis course is authorized as an Advanced Placement® (AP®) course by the AP Course Audit. The AP Course Audit was created by the College Board to give schools and students the confidence that all AP courses meet or exceed the same clearly articulated curricular expectations of colleges and universities.\n\nBy taking an AP course and scoring successfully on the related AP Exam, students can:\n\nStand Out in College Admissions\n\tEarn College Credits\n\tSkip Introductory Classes\n\tBuild College Skills\nAdvanced Placement® and AP® are trademarks registered and/or owned by the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\n \n\n                                    ",
