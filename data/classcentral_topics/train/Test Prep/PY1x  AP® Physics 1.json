Whether you are preparing for an upcoming exam or looking for a more challenging Physics course to add to your current curriculum, AP Physics 1 is a great place to start. This challenging course is designed to help high school students prepare for the AP Physics 1 test, and covers all of the material for the test supported by videos, simulations, and online labs.\n\nTopics include motion, forces, gravitation, energy and momentum, rotation, harmonic motion, and an introduction to electric charge and basic circuits. Each module ends with an assessment, with questions similar in style to those on the AP test, and the course wraps up with a mock AP test.\n\nThe course runs from September through May, which parallels many high school AP Physics 1 courses. You may choose to take this course simultaneously with a high school AP course, or on its own to help you prepare for the AP exam. Five peer-grading exercises that are part of the course will be available starting in January.\n\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\nThis course is authorized as an Advanced Placement® (AP®) course by the AP Course Audit.
