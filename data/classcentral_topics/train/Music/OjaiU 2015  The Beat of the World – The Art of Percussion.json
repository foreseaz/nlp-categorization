This free course is made up of four classes that should take approximately one hour each to complete. Our instructor is OMF2015 music director percussionist Steven Schick, who will explore with us the art of percussion.\r\nIn the first class we’ll explore the percussion found in nature and in our environment around us. In the second we’ll explore how objects become musical instruments. In the third, we’ll see how the context and physicality of percussion tells stories, and we’ll conclude in the fourth class with how our musical language of sound has and is evolving.\r\nEach class will consist of video lectures, musical examples and demonstrations and listening assignments. Classes begin Monday May 11, with a new one released each Monday after that for four weeks.\n\n                                    ",
