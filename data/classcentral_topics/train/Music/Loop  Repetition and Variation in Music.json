This will be approached through a study of form and variation techniques used in music. Students will be asked to make more from less while maintaining musical interest in their compositions.\n\nCompositional techniques and styles studied include minimalism, ambient, alternative, musique concréte, popular, independent, experimental and sample based music. Assessment will consist of short composition assignments (1-2 min) rooted in class discussion and readings. These will be turned in as audio files. A single composition of 5-10 minutes will act as the final project.\n\nBy the end of this course students will be able to:\n\n· Compose an engaging piece of music using a minimum amount of musical material.\n\n· Critically engage with a piece of music through aural analysis.\n\n· Analyze or break down music compositions to determine structural form and construction.\n\n· Adapt compositional principles to their own music.\n\n· Discover new approaches to music composition.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: Critical Listening And Analysis Strategies Without Traditional Music Theory \r\nSession 2: Creating Music In A DAW And Composing A Simple Shape With Sound \r\nSession 3: How Loops Can Be Used To Create Harmonic Or Structural Changes And Discovering Different Pathways To Accomplish The Goal \r\nSession 4: Defining, Creating, And Losing A Sense Of Time In Loop Based Music \r\nSession 5: Examining Ambient Tracks And Analyzing The Compositional Elements At Work \r\nSession 6: Sources And Inspiration: Strategies For Sample Based Collage Works \r\nSession 7: Understanding EQ And Its Role In Composition And Mixing \r\nSession 8: Examining The Extramusical Content Of Your Work \r\nSession 9: Form As Musical Expression \r\nSession 10: Synthesis Of Ideas: The Many From The One And Back Again \n                                    ",
