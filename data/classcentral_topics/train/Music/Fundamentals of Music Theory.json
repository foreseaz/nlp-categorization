It will introduce you to the theory of Western music, providing you with the skills needed to read and write Western music notation, as well as to understand, analyse, and listen informedly.  It will provide the\nbasis for the further study of music both from a theoretical and practical\npoint of view: musicology, pastiche and free composition, analysis,\nperformance, and aural skills.  It will\nalso be useful to experienced musicians without music notation skills who wish\nto extend their practice through a grounding in the tools of Western music\ntheory and notation.\n\n\n\nFollow us on twitter @musictheorymooc #edmusictheory\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week-by-Week\nbreakdown\n\nPitches, scales, modes, and chordsKeys and intervalsRhythm and formHarmony 1: functional harmonyHarmony 2: inversions, cadences, and\nsequencesFinal AssignmentPeer Review\n                                    ",
