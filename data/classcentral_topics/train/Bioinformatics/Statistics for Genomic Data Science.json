This is the sixth course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1This course is structured to hit the key conceptual ideas of normalization, exploratory analysis, linear modeling, testing, and multiple testing that arise over and over in genomic studies. Module 2This week we will cover preprocessing, linear modeling, and batch effects.Module 3This week we will cover modeling non-continuous outcomes (like binary or count data), hypothesis testing, and multiple hypothesis testing.Module 4In this week we will cover a lot of the general pipelines people use to analyze specific data types like RNA-seq, GWAS, ChIP-Seq, and DNA Methylation studies. \n                                    ",
