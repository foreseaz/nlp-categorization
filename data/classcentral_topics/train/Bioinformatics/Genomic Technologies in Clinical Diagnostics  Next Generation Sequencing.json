Invasive Down syndrome tests in pregnancy have made way for the evaluation of fetal DNA in maternal blood. And instead of laborious gene-by-gene targeted sequencing, we can now sequence all of our genes in parallel in a single experiment.\n\nUnderstand and apply genomic sequencing technologies\n\nThis postgraduate-level course, in combination with Genomic Technologies in Clinical Diagnostics: Molecular Techniques, will help you understand these new and established genetic technologies, and their application to clinical practice.\n\nThis course focuses on genomic sequencing. By the end, you will be able to:\n\n\n  demonstrate an understanding of the molecular principles behind next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies;\n  identify appropriate applications of these technologies to clinical scenarios within both diagnostic and research settings;\n  and evaluate alternative applications of next generation sequencing technologies outside of DNA sequencing, such as RNA seq and ChIP-seq.\n\n\nContinue studying with St George’s, University of London\n\nBoth Genomic Technologies in Clinical Diagnostics courses draw on the experience of experts in clinical genetics and education at St George’s, University of London.\n\nThe two courses will provide you with the teaching component of module 1 of the PGCert in Interpretation and Clinical Application of Genomic Data (PGCert ICAG) from St George’s. To apply for the PGCert ICAG, you must be employed as a genetics trainee within the UK, and hold a national training number (NTN) in clinical genetics.\n\nIf you complete both courses on FutureLearn and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will have completed the teaching component of the module, should you apply to study at St George’s.\n\n\n                                    ",
