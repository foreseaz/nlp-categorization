We will learn a little about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used.  We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        DNA sequencing, strings and matchingThis module we begin our exploration of algorithms for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We'll discuss DNA sequencing technology, its past and present, and how it works.\nPreprocessing, indexing and approximate matchingIn this module, we learn useful and flexible new algorithms for solving the exact and approximate matching problems.  We'll start by learning Boyer-Moore, a fast and very widely used algorithm for exact matchingEdit distance, assembly, overlapsThis week we finish our discussion of read alignment by learning about algorithms that solve both the edit distance problem and related biosequence analysis problems, like global and local alignment.Algorithms for assemblyIn the last module we began our discussion of the assembly problem and we saw a couple basic principles behind it.  In this module, we'll learn a few ways to solve the alignment problem.\n                                    ",
