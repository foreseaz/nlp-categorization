The book and course materials are all free and licensed as Creative Commons. There is no complex math in the course, the programs are generally quite short, and the workload is no more than a few hours per week. By the time you complete the course, you will understand be able to read, parse, and manipulate data using Python. Hopefully at the end of the course you will like programming well enough to take another course in programming or web development. You can register and launch, take the course, and earn your place on the map at any time and at your own pace\n\n                                    ",
