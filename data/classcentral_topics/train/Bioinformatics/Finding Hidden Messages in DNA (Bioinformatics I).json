Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat. After warming up our algorithmic muscles, we will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to real experimental datasets.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1The description goes hereWeek 2The description goes hereWeek 3The description goes hereWeek 4The description goes hereWeek 5Bioinformatics Application Challenge!\n                                    ",
