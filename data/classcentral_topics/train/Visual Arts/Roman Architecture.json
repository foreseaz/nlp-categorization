While architectural developments in Rome,\n    Pompeii, and Central Italy are highlighted, the course also provides a survey of sites and structures in what are now North Italy, Sicily, France, Spain, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, and North Africa.  Some of the\n    learning materials have been adapted from the Roman Architecture course recorded for Open Yale Courses; others are new. The lectures  are illustrated with over 1,500 images, many from my personal collection.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course\nSyllabusWeek 1 Material available at 6\nAM EST, Monday, September 7·      \nIntroduction to Roman Architecture·      \nIt Takes a City: The Founding of Rome and the Beginnings of\nUrbanism in ItalyWeek 2Material available at 6\nAM EST, Monday, September 14·      \nTechnology and Revolution in Roman Architecture·      \nCivic Life Interrupted; Nightmare and Destiny on August 24, A.D.\n79·      \nWriting Assignment 1: Does New Technology Lead\nto Innovation or Innovation to New Technology?
