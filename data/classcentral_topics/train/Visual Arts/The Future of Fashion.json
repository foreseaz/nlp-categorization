A typical module might include a web exploration, an image gallery, a brief reading and guiding questions.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are designed to be completed on a weekly basis, users may progress through the sections entirely at their own pace. Once three modules have been completed, a quiz will be administered and participants will be able to move forward through the next three. Quizzes assess completion of course content and can be taken multiple times.\n\n                                    ",
