Participants will also have the opportunity to practice three-dimensional design and develop an art e-portfolio. This course is specifically designed for high school students interested in exploring their creativity and developing foundational skills in art and design with an eye toward possibly applying to college art/design programs.\r\nCreated by expert and passionate faculty from Otis College of Art and Design, the course will be organized into thematic modules, including perspective and color, light and shadow, materials and tools, line and shape, anatomy and expression, and invention and construction. All skill levels can participate in these sessions and are welcome.\r\nStudents should be curious, flexible, and willing to experiment. Basic computer skills such as being able to attach documents and navigate a website are helpful. Students should also have access to a camera or scanner to share work.\n\n                                    ",
