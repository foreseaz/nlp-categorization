In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance\nwas increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed\nimmediate questions of decorative language \n(antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of\nconceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic\nstructural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first,\nthe new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system,\nand only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural\nconceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms\nand models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first\naffirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.\n\n\nThrough some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance\n    architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance\n    theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces,\n    technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti’s\n    to Francesco di Giorgio’s and Bramante’s proposals.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.
