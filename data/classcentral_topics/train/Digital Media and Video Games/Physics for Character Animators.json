This course presents the concepts that are most useful to character animation artists. Topics of study include:\r\n\r\nCenter of Gravity and Static Balance\r\nDynamic Balance and Weight Shift\r\nJoints, Levers, and Torque\r\nAction and Reaction\r\nPhysics of Jumps\r\nPhysics of Walks\r\nCreating Scale\r\n\r\nThis course is self-paced and has no math beyond multiplication and division. As a capstone assignment youâ€™ll apply what you learn to create your own character animation shot.\n\n                                    ",
