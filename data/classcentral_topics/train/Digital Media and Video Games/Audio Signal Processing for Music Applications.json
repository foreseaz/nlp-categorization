We focus on a number of spectral processing\ntechniques of relevance for the description and transformation of sounds, developing the basic theoretical and practical knowledge with which to analyze,\nsynthesize, transform and describe audio signals in the context of music\napplications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course is based on open software and content.
