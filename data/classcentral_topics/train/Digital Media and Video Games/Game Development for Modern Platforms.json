In this hands-on course you will explore how to develop a game for a variety of modern platforms, including Web, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. While building a complete game, you will learn intermediate and advanced game development techniques in the Unity game engine.  By the end of the course, you will understand how to develop, refine, package, and prepare your game for distribution on a variety of game platforms. Particular attention will be given to developing a 2D platformer game that supports multiple forms of input (keyboard/mouse, controller, and touch), works across multiple forms of output (screen size, screen resolution, sound), and performs well on a variety of computing devices.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Starting the ProjectHello game developers!\n\nAcross this course, we will build a complete 2D platformer game as a vehicle to talk about how to develop, refine, package, and prepare games for distribution on a variety of game platforms.  This week we will launch right into the thick of it and set up our 2D game, create our player, and give the player control.\n\nIf you are having troubles with a concept, quiz, or technical issue with Unity, you should post on the Discussion Forum to ask for help.

We will continue to introduce additional design and programming concepts along the way.  And, at the end of this week, you will start the process of modifying the game and transforming it into your own creation!
