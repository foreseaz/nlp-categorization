There will be special\n    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr. Ge Wang (Stanford\n    University) and Dr. Perry R. Cook (Princeton University).\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nWEEK 1: Basics: Sound, Waves, and ChucK ProgrammingWEEK 2: Libraries and ArraysWEEK 3: Sound File ManipulationWEEK 4: FunctionsWEEK 5: Unit Generators and Physical ModelsWEEK 6: Multi-Threading and ConcurrencyWEEK 7: Objects and ClassesWEEK 8: Live Control: Keyboard, Mouse &amp; MIDI\n\n                                    ",
