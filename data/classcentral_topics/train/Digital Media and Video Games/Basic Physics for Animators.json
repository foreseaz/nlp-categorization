Chuck Jones once said, “We must all start with the believable. That is the essence of our craft.” This course will show you how to create believable motion and when to break the laws of physics.\r\nThis self-paced course covers the basic concepts in physics that are most useful for animation artists. The topics are:\r\n\r\nTiming, Spacing, and Falling\r\nPath of Action &amp; Arcs\r\nInertia, Follow-through, and Drag\r\nForces &amp; Action\r\nPressure &amp; Lift\r\nCycles &amp; Rotation\r\nSquash &amp; Stretch\r\n\r\nAs a capstone assignment you'll create a short animation (10-30 seconds) using the concepts learned in the course.\n\n                                    ",
