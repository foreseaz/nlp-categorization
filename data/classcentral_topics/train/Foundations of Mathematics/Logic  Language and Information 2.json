Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin. Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    logic2-001\n                                                                    logic2-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Information is everywhere: in our words and our world, our thoughts and our theories, our devices and our databases. Logic is the study of that information: the features it has, how it’s represented, and how we can manipulate it. Learning logic helps you formulate and answer many different questions about information:Does this hypothesis clash with the evidence we have or is it consistent with the evidence?Is this argument watertight, or do we need to add more to make the conclusion to really follow from the premises?Do these two sentences say the same things in different ways, or do they say something subtly different?Does this information follow from what’s in this database, and what procedure could we use to get the answer quickly?Is there a more cost-effective design for this digital circuit? And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?These are questions about Logic. When you learn logic you'll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we're dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven't yet imagined. Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.This subject follows from Logic: Language and Information 1, to cover core techniques in first order predicate logic: the idea of formal languages with quantifiers, which gives us a way to talk about more logical structure than in propositional logic; and we will cover the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs in predicate logic. But you won’t only learn these concepts and tools. We will also explore how these techniques connect with issues in linguistics, computer science, electronic engineering, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1. The Syntax of Predicate Logic; Translations using quantifiersWeek 2. Models for Predicate Logic; Classifying propositions and arguments; Finite and Infinite DomainsWeek 3. Tree Proofs for Predicate Logic; Soundness and CompletenessWeek 4.
