The group could not only be an organization such as a company or a team in a company, but also a private group such as your family or an association. \n\nSpecifically, you’ll apply the 4 steps of The Savoir-Relier protocol to your group: \n1. defining the group identity by working on the group self-awareness, \n2. creating quality relationships within the group, \n3. working on resilience for the group to then be able to overcome difficult situation and \n4. Making the organization grow by creating sense and meaning.\n\nSo if you want your group to grow as a successful leader in its fields, if you want to find your identity as a group and create shared values for it, or if you want your group to become more resilient in face of change and crisis, this course is made for you! Finally, at the end of the course, you would have build sense for your group in order to be more efficient.\n\nUsing real-life cases you will see how the genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts. You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.\n\nLeaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Self-awareness at the organization levelIn this module and with the help of feedbacks from leaders in different environments, from start ups to large companies (Maurice Lévy from Publicis, Stéphane Richard from Orange, Frédéric Mazzella from BlaBlaCar, Daphne Koller from Coursera or Apollonia Poilâne from Poilâne), you will use history and communication to better perform the balance between the need for structure and the need for initiative in making a group effective.Building quality relationships in the organizationWith this module, you will master your capacity to use communication effectively and value diversity.  You will facilitate the development and growth of a group or company project thanks to quality, i.e. trustworthy, genuine and generous relationships.Building resilience for the organizationListening to several stories of resilience from different perspectives and companies, you will be invited to reflect on how resilience applies to organizations and how in the corporate world, resilience breeds innovation as with Publicis and Orange for example,  resilience to better manage crises and conflicts inside groups or companies. Then you will apply resilience mechanisms to facilitate innovation in the organization.Creating sense for the organizationWith module 4 you will build a generative environment to foster a dynamic of positive change that creates sense at the group level and in complex settings. You will be able to use metaphors and take a high bird’s view on problems and issues thanks to the savoir-relier methodology.\n                                    ",
