Companies are also increasingly operating globally and facing competition from not only domestic but also foreign sources. Economic trends are also putting pressure on organizations to do more with less. Thus, companies are looking at how to get the most from their employees. Today, companies continue to fight the war for talent.\r\n\r\nWith advances in technology, people are increasingly able to work remotely from just about any location, not just at their employer’s work site. This opens up new opportunities and new issues in terms of how people accomplish work and how organizations plan strategies to meet their goals.\r\n\r\nThis course is designed to expose HR professionals and leaders to the business case for remote work and key drivers to align remote work programs in their organizations’ strategic priorities.\"\n\n                                    ",
