All these skills will help you create sense in your team so you can lead it better.\n\nThis course is part of a Specialization on Leadership called “Inspirational Leadership: Leading with Sense”, so you may want to take the course “Building Your Leadership Skills” prior of taking this course.\nAs where in course 1 “Building Your Leadership Skills” you have mostly worked on your inner-self and on the relation between you and the other, in this course you’ll work on the relationship between you and the group, improving your leadership skills when interacting in a team. \n\nLeaders from different organizations and participants of the HEC Paris Leadership Certificate, the program from which this course and specialization is inspired, will share with you their insights about what it takes to become a great leader in a group or team and what they are able to achieve now that they apply The Savoir-Relier methodology.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Understand your leadership styleBy the end of this module you will have further explored and tested your leadership characteristics by comparing them to the genuine, generous and generative attitude of the savoir-relier leader. Your self-awareness will get to a higher level thanks to the second self-portrait exercise.Positioning your leadershipWith this module you will manage your own leadership style with reference to different leadership models and you will be able to adapt your style to the situation, task and people. Your second conversation will build more confidence and you will master your relational skills even more.Embracing change from resilienceBy this end of this module you will know how to become more resilient and apply that skill to facing complex problems or inventing new ways and solutions to new situations.Building sense for your leadership challengeWith this module you will become sense builders, that is someone who can create sense to drive change and innovation.
