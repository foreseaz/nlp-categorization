Whether you’re a student, an individual contributor, a recent manager just starting to lead others, an experienced mid-level manager, or someone passionate about making an impact on your community, you too can benefit from leadership development!\r\n\r\nLeaderMOOC builds on the latest research from the Center for Creative Leadership on the “fundamental four” leadership capabilities needed for success: self-awareness, learning agility, influence, and communication. Participants will vote on one additional area they would like to explore.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis throughout is “leadership for real,” so rather than taking an academic approach, the course allows participants to discover, for each topic, something essential about their own leadership strengths and challenges, as well as how to translate these insights into real situations in the workplace and community.\"\n\n                                    ",
