To get at this issue, we will look at a number of issues having to do with human language, the development of the brain, and a variety of proposals about language in evolution, including the Integration Hypothesis that the instructor recently proposed with colleagues.\r\nLearning outcomes\r\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\r\n            describe and explain the issues pertaining to language and evolution\r\n            describe some of the brain regions that support language\r\n            describe some major proposals for how language emerged in evolution\r\n            describe the systems that underlie birdsong and primate communication\r\n            describe and explain the basic components of a sentence\r\n            explain how the integration hypothesis incorporates what we know about other systems that underlie communication\n\n                                    ",
