You will learn about the way in which anthropology as a discipline can shed new perspectives on current world issues, from indigeneity to migration and material culture.\n\nWe want to challenge you to reflect on your own perspective when thinking about these issues, how you see the world and how we all engage with difference and sameness on a daily basis.\n\nWe will interview notable anthropologists and follow some around the world and into their field to explore the issues, the people they work with and their place in the world.\n\n                                    ",
