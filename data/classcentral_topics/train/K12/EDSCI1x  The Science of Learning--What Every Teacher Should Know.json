Along the way you will explore the practical implications of cognitive science for classroom teaching in terms of choosing effective instructional strategies, developing useful assessments, motivating student effort, and designing learner-centered curricular units.\n\nThis course is aimed to enhance the practice of K-12 teachers.\n\n                                    ",
