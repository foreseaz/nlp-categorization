This course is designed to give you the tools to create meaningful object-based learning activities that can be integrated into a wide variety of curricula. All the strategies we will cover emphasize literacy, critical thinking skills that connect across disciplines.Close-Looking and Open-Ended InquiryIn this module we will discuss and review the different ways that you can facilitate close-looking with your students and engaging in open-ended, inquiry-based conversation around works of art.  Donâ€™t wait to start practicing! Grab a friend or a family member and start leading inquiry-based conversation around a work of art, or anything! As you will see in the recorded Google Hangout video, you can use a digital image to converse online or any object that you have around that would lend itself to leading an inquiry. These practice sessions are not required but the more you practice, the easier and better your classroom performance will be. Activities as InquiryThis section explores interactive methods that promote an open-ended, two-way exchange of ideas and engage a specific set of skills including: close-looking, peer-to-peer learning, creative thinking, and problem-solving.Putting it all Together:  Making Connections Across CurriculumIn this module we will model ways that you can incorporate inquiry around a work of art into your classroom and make connections to curricula.  We will also explore the types of resources that you can access to supplement your lesson development and planning.\n                                    ",
