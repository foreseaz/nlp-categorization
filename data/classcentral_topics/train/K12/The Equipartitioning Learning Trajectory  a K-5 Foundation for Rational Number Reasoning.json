Our first course introduces the Equipartitioning LT. Grounded in fair sharing activities that create equal-sized groups (from collections) or parts (from single wholes), Equipartitioning provides a robust foundation for students’ conceptual understanding of division, multiplication, fraction, and ratio. We recommend this course for elementary and middle grades educators seeking a deeper understanding of students’ learning of fundamental mathematics for their own instructional practice.\n\n                                    ",
