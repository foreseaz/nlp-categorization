In this course, we will explore how to support all students but particularly English language learners, in engaging in this key, cross-disciplinary practice.\r\nIn this course teachers will use a range of practical tools for gathering and analyzing language samples that show how students currently construct claims supported by evidence and/or reasoning, as well as identifying next steps in students’ development. These tools can support formative assessment and instructional planning. Focal topics include: articulating claims; linking evidence and/or reasoning to claims; and evaluating evidence and/or reasoning. We will also explore similarities and differences in argumentation across content areas and grade levels. This course will enable teachers to collaborate with other educators and build professional relationships that result in an online community focused on improving students’ abilities to engage in argumentation across content areas.\n\n                                    ",
