A Comprehensive K-3 Reading Policy establishes intensive reading intervention for K-3 students who are at risk of reading failure to help ensure they read on grade level by the end of third grade. This course will provide participants with the tools and resources necessary to develop and implement a Comprehensive K-3 Reading Policy by taking a deep dive into why reading by the end of third grade is critical to student success, understanding supporting research, and exploring effective implementation practices\n\n                                    ",
