It derives Prandtl’s Boundary Layer Equations for laminar boundary layers from the basic Navier-Stokes equations and discusses their exact solutions. It discusses how a laminar boundary layer transitions to turbulence and separates. It also discusses thermal boundary layers. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to spectroscopic methods – Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), spin ½ nuclei, 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, FT-NMR method.
