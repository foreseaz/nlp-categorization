These concepts will prepare students for a mechanistic-based approach to learning organic reactivity. Emphasis will also be placed on developing problem-solving skills unique to organic chemistry. This course, orgchem1b, together with its prerequisite, orgchem1a are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (orgchem2a and orgchem2b) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\n\n\n\nLesson\n\n\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nSubst &amp; Elimination Stereochem\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nCarbocation RAR\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nLGs &amp; Ring-Opening\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nCarbon Nucleophiles\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nE+ Addition to C=C\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nE+ Addition to C≡C\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nStereochem of E+ Addn\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nCarbonyl Reactivity\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nC=O &amp; Conjugate Addn\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAcyl Substitution\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nSubstitution + Addition\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nSubstitution of =O\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nEnols and Enolates\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nThe C-alpha nucleophile\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nExam Review\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nAldol Addition\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nClaisen Condensation\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nAromatic Chemistry\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nAromatic Subst (E+)\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nAromatic Subst (other)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ",
