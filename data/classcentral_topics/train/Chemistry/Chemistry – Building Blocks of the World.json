You will learn about atoms, the building blocks of everything around us. You’ll learn about how these atoms are put together to make compounds, to make most of the materials that we use every day.\r\nWe’ll have some fun looking at some common types chemical reactions and finally, we’ll use our knowledge of these chemical reactions along with a new way of quantifying the world in order to be able to make powerful predictions about quantitative chemistry.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nIdentify different types of matter around you\r\nDevelop an appreciation for some of the historical milestones in the development of modern chemistry\r\nDescribe the basic structure of the atom, giving specific details for any given element\r\nDevelop knowledge of the periodic table and its structure\r\nExplain why atoms join together to form different compounds\r\nBuild and name simple ionic and covalent chemical compounds\r\nRead, write, balance and comprehend chemical reactions through the use of chemical equations\r\nPredict the solubility behaviour of simple ionic and covalent compounds\r\nRecognise common occurrences of acid-base, endothermic, exothermic and combustion reaction\r\nComprehend the mole concept and how it relates to quantification\r\nUse the mole concept to be able to calculate masses, volumes, concentrations and the number of individual atoms that make up a given material\r\nCombine your understanding of chemical equations and the mole concept to make quantitative predictions regarding the outcome of a chemical reaction\r\n\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nLaboratory Technician\r\nAnalyst\r\nUndergraduate\r\nIndustrial chemist\r\nQuality control chemist\r\nResearch assistant\r\nPostgraduate\r\nResearch Scientist\r\nAcademic\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 1: THE WORLD IS MADE OF MATTER\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 2: SHAPING THE WORLD - HOW IS DIFFERENT MATTER MADE?\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 3: MAKING IT HAPPEN – CHEMICAL REACTIONS\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 4: WHAT’S IN A MOLE?
