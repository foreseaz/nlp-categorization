However, at the university level and in industry, we learn that science is not as simple as we once thought. We are constantly confronted by questions about the unknown and required to use creative, integrated approaches to solve these problems. By bringing together knowledge from multidisciplinary fields, we are empowered with the ability to generate new ideas. The goal of this course is to develop skills for generating new ideas at the interface between chemistry and biology by analyzing pioneering studies.\n\nWhen should I register?\nRegistration will be open throughout the course. However, if a learner wants to receive a certificate, he/she should register by the end of April.\n\n                                    ",
