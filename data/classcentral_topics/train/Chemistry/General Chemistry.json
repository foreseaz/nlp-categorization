Everything you see, touch, or feel is made up of elements. This course begins with the basic concepts of chemistry such as atoms, molecules, ions, how to express measured quantities through scientific notation, and the periodic table. The course then progresses to energy, atomic and molecular structure, the properties of gases, liquids, solids, and solutions, and an introduction to organic chemistry.\n\n                                    ",
