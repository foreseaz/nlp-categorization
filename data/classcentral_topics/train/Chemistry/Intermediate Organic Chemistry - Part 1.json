Mechanistic concepts and models of reactivity are developed to build intuition about how organic compounds undergo their chemical transformations. An emphasis will be placed on developing problem-solving skills using frontier molecular orbitals to prepare students to think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems (e.g., nucleic acids, aromatic and heteroaromatic amino acids, etc.). This course and Part 2 are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course, and these courses are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Structural Fundamentals; The Curved-arrow Formalism; Introduction to Orbital TheoryWeek 2: Constructing &amp; Interpreting Molecular Orbitals; Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory; Non-traditional ResonanceWeek 3: π Delocalization &amp; Color; Aromaticity &amp; Cyclic, π-type Molecular Orbitals; Aromatic HeterocyclesWeek 4: Cycloaddition Reactions; Cycloaddition Theory; Other Pericyclic ReactionsWeek 5: Organic Reaction Mechanisms &amp; Proton Transfer; Strategies for Drawing Mechanisms; Patterns in Electron Flow &amp; ReactivityWeek 6: Reaction Intermediates, Transition States &amp; Stability Trends; Radical ChemistryWeek 7: Photochemical Reactions; Kinetics &amp; Thermodynamics; CatalysisWeek 8: Stereotopic Relationships; Stereochemistry &amp; Symmetry; Facial Stereotopic Relationships\n                                    ",
