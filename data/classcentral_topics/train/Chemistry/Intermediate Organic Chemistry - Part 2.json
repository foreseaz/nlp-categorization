The structure and reactivity of the major classes of bioorganic molecules - proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids - will be covered in detail. An introduction to biosynthesis will be presented, along with the use of contemporary literature and structural databases. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on mechanism-based problem-solving skills to help students understand and think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems. This course, orgchem2b, and its prerequisite, orgchem2a, are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course; these courses are well suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\n\n\n\nLesson\n\n\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nTopic Relationships\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nProchirality\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAmino Acids\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n3D Protein Structure &amp; Noncovalent Interactions\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nPeptide Chemistry\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nEnzyme Catalysis\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nEnzyme Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nEnzyme Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nEnzyme Stereochem.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nEnzymatic Elimin.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nBiosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nExam Review\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nMonosaccharides\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nCarbohydrate Reactions\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nOligosaccharides\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nNucleic Acids\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nBioorganic Phosphorus\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nProtein Biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nLiterature &amp; Databases\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nExam Review\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ",
