Besides plain texts, especially multimedia information such as graphics, audio or video have become a predominant part of the web's information traffic. But, how can we find useful information within this huge information space? How can we make use of the knowledge contained in those web documents? Traditional search engines for example will reach the limits of their power, when it comes to understanding information content. The Semantic Web is an extension of the traditional web in the sense that information in the form of natural language text in the web will be complemented by its explicit semantics based on a formal knowledge representation. Thus, the meaning of information expressed in natural language can be accessed in an automated way and interpreted correctly, i.e. it can be ‘understood’ by machines.\r\nSemantic Web technologies enable the explicit representation of knowledge and its further processing to deduce new knowledge from implicitly hidden knowledge. Thus, information access and information search will be more precise and more complete compared to today's traditional information retrieval technology. Previously heterogeneous data can be mapped and combined based on common knowledge representation and schemata easily extended in a dynamic way.\r\nIn this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Web technologies and how they are applied for knowledge representation in the World Wide Web. You will learn how to represent knowledge with ontologies and how to access and benefit from semantic data on the Web. Furthermore, you will also learn how to make use of Linked Data and the Web of Data, currently the most popular applications based on Semantic Web technologies.\r\nRequirements for this course:\r\n\r\na basic knowledge of the foundations of mathematical logics, i.e. propositional logics and first order logics\r\na basic understanding of web technologies, such as URL, http, HTML, and XML-based technologies\r\na basic knowledge of database technology, esp. relational databasesand SQL query language\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 1: Knowledge Engineering and the Web of Data\r\nWeek 2: Semantic Web Technologies - Part 1\r\nWeek 3: Semantic Web Technologies - Part 2\r\nWeek 4: Knowledge Representation - Part 1\r\nWeek 5: Knowledge Representation - Part 2\r\nWeek 6: Knowledge Engineering\r\nFinal examination: Final examination\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ",
