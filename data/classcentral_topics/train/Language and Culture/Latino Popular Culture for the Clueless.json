We believe that the skills this class hones will ultimately help you to become a more accountable actor, rather than merely a spectator, in the hemispheric American condition.We hope you notice from the title of the course that we have a playful approach to teaching and learning, because we really don't think that you're clueless at all. We are not just here to examine how Latino groups express their values and hopes, we are also here to learn how YOU express your values and hopes. So get ready to do exercises and assignments that play with your own ideas about your community and your identity. You will be our most important \"textbook\" in this class.All lectures and instructional materials developed for this course by the Ohio State University are licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
