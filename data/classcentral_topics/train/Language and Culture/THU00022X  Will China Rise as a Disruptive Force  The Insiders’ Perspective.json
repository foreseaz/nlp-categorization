The rapid emergence of China as a key player in the global political and economic landscape has led many to question how China’s decision makers perceive today’s world. What are their views on major global affairs? How does Chinese history and philosophy shape their outlook of the world? What are the prospects for China’s future economic growth?\n\nThis course helps learners understand the rise of modern China from an insiders’ perspective with insight from three of China’s leading social philosophy, international relations and economic experts.\n\n                                    ",
