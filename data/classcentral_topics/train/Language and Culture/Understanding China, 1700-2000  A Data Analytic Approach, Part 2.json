Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Part.\nPart One focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. Please note that Part One was\npreviously named ‘A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New\nMethods, Part 1’.Part Two turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 2 covers the following subjects:\nWho Are We\nWho Survives\nWho Reproduces\nWho Marries\nWho Cares\nConclusion\n                                    ",
