Software capabilities will be covered with R® receiving particular emphasis.  The course will also cover the basics of record linkage and statistical matching—both of which are becoming more important as ways of combining data from different sources.  Combining of datasets raises ethical issues which the course reviews.  Informed consent may have to be obtained from persons to allow their data to be linked. You will learn about differences in the legal requirements in different countries.\n\n                                    ",
