R works in a wide range of operating systems such as UNIX, Windows or MacOS. Despite its potential, versatility and flexibility arid R may appear when the user is interacting with the components. It is said that \"the learning curve is slow\". However, the results it produces are highly satisfactory. This course is intended to \"lubricate\" those first encounters with this statistical environment.\n\n                                    ",
