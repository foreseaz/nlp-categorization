This will give you the opportunity to sample and apply the basic techniques of data science.\n\nThis course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.Why Take This Course?You will have an opportunity to work through a data science project end to end, from analyzing a dataset to visualizing and communicating your data analysis.\n\nThrough working on the class project, you will be exposed to and understand the skills that are needed to become a data scientist yourself.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science\n\n- Introduction to Data Science\n- What is a Data Scientist\n- Pi-Chaun (Data Scientist @ Google): What is Data Science?\n- Gabor (Data Scientist @ Twitter): What is Data Science?\n- Problems Solved by Data Science \n- Pandas\n- Dataframes\n- Create a New Dataframe\n\n### Lesson 2: Data Wrangling \n\n- What is Data Wrangling?\n- Acquiring Data\n- Common Data Formats\n- What are Relational Databases?\n- Aadhaar Data \n- Aadhaar Data and Relational Databases\n- Introduction to Databases Schemas\n- APIâ€™s\n- Data in JSON Format\n- How to Access an API efficiently \n- Missing Values\n- Easy Imputation\n- Impute using Linear Regression\n- Tip of the Imputation Iceberg\n\n### Lesson 3: Data Analysis\n\n- Statistical Rigor\n- Kurt (Data Scientist @ Twitter) - Why is Stats Useful?\n- Introduction to Normal Distribution\n- T Test\n- Welch T Test\n- Non-Parametric Tests\n- Non-Normal Data\n- Stats vs. Machine Learning\n- Different Types of Machine Learning\n- Prediction with Regression \n- Cost Function\n- How to Minimize Cost Function\n- Coefficients of Determination\n\n### Lesson 4: Data Visualization\n\n- Effective Information Visualization\n- Napoleon's March on Russia\n- Don (Principal Data Scientist @ AT&amp;T): Communicating Findings\n- Rishiraj (Principal Data Scientist @ AT&amp;T): Communicating Findings Well\n- Visual Encodings\n- Perception of Visual Cues\n- Plotting in Python\n- Data Scales\n- Visualizing Time Series Data\n\n### Lesson 5: MapReduce\n\n- Big Data and MapReduce\n- Basics of MapReduce\n- Mapper\n- Reducer\n- MapReduce with Aadhaar Data\n- MapReduce with Subway Data\n                                    ",
