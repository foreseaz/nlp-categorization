You will learn how to install and configure software\nnecessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming\nlanguage concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language.\nThe course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes\nprogramming in R, reading data into R, creating informative data graphics,\naccessing R packages, creating R packages with documentation, writing R\nfunctions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical\ndata analysis and optimization will provide working examples.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        A student who has completed this course is able to:Read formatted data into RSubset, remove missing values from, and clean tabular dataWrite custom functions in R to implement new functionality and making use of control structures such as loops and conditionalsUse the R code debugger to identify problems in R functionsMake a scatterplot/boxplot/histogram/image plot and modify a plot with custom annotationsDefine a new data class in R and write methods for that class\n                                    ",
