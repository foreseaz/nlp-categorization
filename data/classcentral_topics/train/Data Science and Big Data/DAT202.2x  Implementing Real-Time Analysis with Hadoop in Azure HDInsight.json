You can sign up for a free Azure trial subscription (a valid credit card is required for verification, but you will not be charged for Azure services). Note that the free trial is not available in all regions. It is possible to complete the course and earn a certificate without completing the hands-on practices.\n\nThis course is the second in a series that explores big data and advanced analytics techniques with HDInsight; and builds on the batch processing techniques learned in DAT202.1x: Processing Big Data with Hadoop in Azure HDInsight.\n\n                                    ",
