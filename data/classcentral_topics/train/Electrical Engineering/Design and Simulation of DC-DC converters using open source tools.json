This course emphasises learning and understanding converter topologies through the aid of open sources tools like octave, gEDA and ngSpice. The course starts with a discussion on rectifier circuits and leads on upto multi-output dc-dc converters. Discussions on various topologies are strengthened with the aid of simulation demonstrations and design exercises.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ◦    Rectifiers: Operation and design. Use of octave for design. Use of gEDA, ngSpice environment for simulation.\r\n◦    Non-isolated converters: Buck, boost and buck-boost converters. Operation and design. Simulation of non-isolated converters.\r\n◦    Isolated converters: Forward, Flyback, push-pull, half bridge, full bridge converters. Operation, design and simulation.\r\n◦    Regulation and multi-output converters: Close loop control for converterrs, multi-output converters, current control \n                                    ",
