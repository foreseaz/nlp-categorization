In this introductory course, we will discuss theory of convolutional codes, their encoding and decoding techniques as well as their applications in real world scenarios. We will also study how from simple codes by concatenation we can build more powerful error correcting codes. In particular, we will study in details, one such capacity approaching codes called turbo codes.Â \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:Lecture 1: Introduction to error control codingLecture 2: Introduction to convolutional codes-I: state diagram, trellis diagramLecture 3: Introduction to convolutional codes-II: classification, realization, distance properties\r\nWeek 2:Lecture 4: Decoding of convolutional codes-I: Viterbi algorithmLecture 5: Decoding of convolutional codes-II: BCJR algorithm\r\nWeek 3:Lecture 6: Introduction to concatenated codes: parallel, serialLecture 7: Turbo codes: encoding, and properties\r\nWeek 4:Lecture 8: Turbo decodingLecture 9: Convergence of turbo decoding algorithm Lecture 10: Applications of convolutional codes\n                                    ",
