Wondering how energy storage elements like capacitors and inductors work, or how to make microchips run faster? This free circuit course taught by edX CEO and MIT Professor Anant Agarwal and colleagues is for you.\n\nThis is the second of three online Circuits and Electronics courses and is taken by all MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) majors.\n\nTopics covered include: MOSFET large signal and small signal analysis; amplifiers; energy storage elements like capacitors and inductors; and dynamics of first-order networks and circuit speed. Design and lab exercises are also significant components of the course.\n\nWeekly coursework includes interactive video sequences, readings from the textbook, homework, online laboratories, and optional tutorials. The course will also have a final exam.\n\nThis is a self-paced course, so there are no weekly deadlines. However, all assignments are due by May 16, 2017, when the course will close.\n\n \n\nStudent Testimonials\n\n“Brilliant course! It's definitely the best introduction to electronics in Universe! Interesting material, clean explanations, well prepared quizzes, challenging homeworks and fun labs.” - Ilya. \n\n“6.002x will be a classic in the field of online learning. It combines Prof. Agarwal's enthusiasm for electronics and education. The online circuit design program works very well. The material is difficult. I took the knowledge from the class and built an electronic cat feeder.” - Stan \n\n                                    ",
