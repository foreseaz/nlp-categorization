Characterizing several components of wireless systems such as the average transmit power, bit-error rate and behavior of the fading channel coefficient requires knowledge of principles of random variables and processes. This course is designed to serve as a basic course towards introducing the students to various aspects of probability from the perspective of modern digital and wireless communications. Thus, it will focus on basic concepts in probability, random variables and random processes, while also illustrating digital/ wireless communication specific examples to better bridge the gap between theory and application.  \r\n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1- Basics of Probability, Conditional Probability, MAP PrincipleWeek 2- Random Variables, Probability Density Functions, Applications in Wireless ChannelsWeek 3- Basics of Random Processes, Wireless Fading Channel Modeling Week 4- Gaussian Random Process, Noise, Bit-Error and Impact on Wireless Systems\n                                    ",
