Applications presented include magnetic data storage, motors, transformers, and spintronics.\n\nThis course is part of a three-part series, which explains the basis of electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of materials including semiconductors, metals, organics, and insulators. We will show how devices are built to take advantage of these properties. This is illustrated with a wide range of devices, placing a strong emphasis on new and emerging technologies.\n\nPart 1 - 3.15.1x: Electronic Materials and Devices\nPart 2 - 3.15.2x: Optical Materials and Devices\n\n                                    ",
