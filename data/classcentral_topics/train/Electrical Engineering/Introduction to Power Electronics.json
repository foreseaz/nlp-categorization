Principles of converter circuit analysis are introduced, and are developed for finding the steady state voltages, current, and efficiency of power converters. Assignments include simulation of a dc-dc converter, analysis of an inverting dc-dc converter, and modeling and efficiency analysis of an electric vehicle system and of a USB power regulator.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will:\n● Understand what a switched-mode converter is and its basic operating principles\n● Be able to solve for the steady-state voltages and currents of step-down, step-up, inverting, and other power converters\n● Know how to derive an averaged equivalent circuit model and solve for the converter efficiency\n\nA basic understanding of electrical circuit analysis is an assumed prerequisite for this course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Ch 1: IntroductionAn introduction to power electronics and to the Coursera specializationCh 2: Steady-State Converter AnalysisHow to find the ideal steady-state voltages and currents of a switched-mode converterCh 3: Steady-State Equivalent Circuit Modeling, Losses, and EfficiencyEquivalent circuit modeling of switching converters, to predict their power conversion functions and efficiency under steady-state conditions\n                                    ",
