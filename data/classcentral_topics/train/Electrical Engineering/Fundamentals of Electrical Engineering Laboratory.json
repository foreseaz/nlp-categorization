Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students. If you hadn't signed up before, you will not be able to download the course.\n                                \n\n                                                            \n\n                            Chrome Plugin\n\n                                                                If you had signed up for this course you will be able to download and save the course materials using the chrome plugin. Click on Go To Class and Log in to your Coursera account to do so.\n                            \n                            Python Script\n                            \n                                                                For the python script to work you will need a class name. Pick one from below:\n                                                                    eefunlab-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This course represents a real hands-on laboratory course in introductory electronics. In it, you will learn how to use the instruments every electrical engineer needs to know: the oscilloscope, function generator and multi-meter. You will use\nthese instruments running on your computer to measure voltages from circuits you will build from actual electrical components with measurement systems provided by National Instruments, Inc. Students will be required to purchase hardware, software\nand electrical parts.\n\nThis laboratory uses the terminology and knowledge of electrical engineering provided in Coursera's Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. You can take the laboratory simultaneously\nwith this course or afterwards. Once you learn the basics found in the laboratory course, you will know how to interface electrical circuits to measurement systems, be they analog or digital. You will have the knowledge to build live circuits and get\nthem to work. No simulations!!\n\n\nThis lab would not be possible without the strong involvement of our industrial partners. National Instruments makes the myDAQ interface equipment as well as the LabView and ELVISMX software system that emulates measurement instruments. DigiKey Corporation\ngathered the diverse collection of electrical and electronics parts into a course-specific parts kit. Mathworks is supplying the Matlab software environment for this course without charge for the course's duration.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lab Zero: Ordering the laboratory kit, opening the box and installing the software. Most electrical engineering systems combine hardware and software systems, and this kit follows that approach. Instruments are implemented in software to run on\nyour computer while the circuits and software perform information processing. Because of delivery of the parts take time, this \"lab\" lasts for several weeks even though it is quite simple.\n\nLab One: Simple DC Circuits. Using a DMM (Digital Multi-Meter) to measure voltage, current, and resistance; an oscilloscope to display time-varying voltages; a power supply to produce constant (DC) voltages; and a function generator to produce time varying\n(AC) voltages.\n\nLab Two: AC Measurements. Characterization and measurement of waveforms using an oscilloscope. Grounding issues. Electro-acoustics—conversion of sound to voltage and back—and opto-electronics—conversion of light to voltage and back.\n\nLab Three: Signal Processing I: Amplifiers. Using the op-amp in various modes for creating amplifiers.\n\nLab Four: Signal Processing II: Filters. Building passive and active filters and measuring their transfer functions.\n\nLab Five: Signals and Systems I. Time-domain and frequency-domain characterization of signals, especially speech.\n\nLab Six: Signals and Systems II. A/D  and D/A conversion. \n\nLab Seven: Digital Signal Processing I. Implementing digital filters.\n\nLab Eight: Digital Signal Processing II. Advanced digital filtering. Generating signals digitally. \"Fancy\" signal processing: speech scramblers, digital music.\n\nLab Nine: Final Project. A combined optical communication/pulse monitor system.\n                                    ",
