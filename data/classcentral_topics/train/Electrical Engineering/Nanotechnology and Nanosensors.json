The present course will provide a survey on some of the\nfundamental principles behind nanotechnology and nanomaterials and their vital\nrole in novel sensing properties and applications. The course will discuss interesting interdisciplinary\nscientific and engineering knowledge at the nanoscale to understand fundamental\nphysical differences at the nanosensors. By the end of the course, students\nwill understand the fabrication, characterization, and manipulation of\nnanomaterials, nanosensors, and how they can be exploited for new applications.\nAlso, students will apply their knowledge of nanotechnology and nanosensors to\na topic of personal interest in this course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to Nanotechnology:\nDefinition of nanotechnology; main features of nanomaterials; types of\nnanostructures (0D, 1D, and 2D structures); nanocomposites; and main\nchemical/physical/electrical/optical properties of nanomaterials.\n\nWeek 2: Introduction to Nanotechnology - continue:\nMethods for characterizing the nanomaterials: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and\nspectroscopy- and spectrometry-based surface analysis techniques.
