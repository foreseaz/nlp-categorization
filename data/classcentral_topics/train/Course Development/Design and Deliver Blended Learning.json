The course is designed to provide exposure to different concepts, tools and techniques that you may find useful. Feel free to skimp over what you already know or find less useful for your purpose. However, you are highly encouraged to give all the learning activities (see asterisked items below) a go!\r\nLearning Outcomes and Course Approach\r\nIn addition to acquiring foundational knowledge on blended learning, you will obtain practical pointers that enable you to:\r\n\r\ndesign effective learning experiences that incorporate both classroom learning and online learning; and\r\ndeploy a variety of face-to-face and online strategies to deliver blended learning effectively.\r\n\r\nTo get the most out of the course, learning activities that require you to reflect on your current practice and make real-time decisions in interactive scenarios have been included.\r\nYou will also be supported to develop a basic blended learning blueprint to get you started on your own journey of learning and experimentation.\r\nDuration to complete the course: 1-3 weeksCertification for completing the course: NonePrerequisites: NoneRequirements for participation: NoneFormat: Self-paced (learn at your own pace)Instructor feedback: No\n\n                                    ",
