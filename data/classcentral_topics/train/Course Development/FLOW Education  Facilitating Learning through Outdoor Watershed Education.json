No prior knowledge is required. Teaching experience and access to students in a classroom is recommended.Montana pre-service and in-service classroom educators only may apply for undergrad and graduate credits from the University of Montana.

In this action plan, learners will develop or adapt an outdoor activity that aligns to the curriculum they teach and the geo-literacy framework (the 3 I’s: interactions, interconnections, implications).In Sessions 1-4: Learners develop an action plan using Action Plan Template and the Action Plan Rubric.In Session 4:  Learners submit a draft of this plan.In Session 5: Learners provide feedback, using the Action Plan Rubric, to two of their peers’ drafts and perform a self-assessment of their project. In Session 6: Learners incorporate their peers’ feedback, and submit their final action plan for their peers to review in the “Course Project Gallery” discussion forum. Learners will also provide final feedback to at least three of their peers’ final plans. \n                                    ",
