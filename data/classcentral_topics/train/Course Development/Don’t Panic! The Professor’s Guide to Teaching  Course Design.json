Teaching is an incredibly difficult endeavor, but its foundation is great course design, which is something you can master. Participants in this course will explore (and teach each other!) how to design interesting, engaging classes that will provide students with opportunities for truly significant learning.\r\nIn this four-week journey, you will develop significant learning goals for your students, learn about and apply authentic assessment practices, examine various types of active learning exercises, and infuse strong design principles throughout the classes you teach. Although the focus will be on college course design, the principles are applicable to any level of education. Join us as we examine the foundation of one of the most important activities on Earth: teaching.\n\n                                    ",
