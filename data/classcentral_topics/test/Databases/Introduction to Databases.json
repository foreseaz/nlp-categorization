Materials from the MOOC offerings have been available for self-study on Coursera as well as on other platforms. Starting in summer 2014, the materials are now being offered on the OpenEdX platform as a set of smaller self-paced \"mini-courses\", which can be assembled in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. All of the mini-courses are based around video lectures and/or video demos. Many of them include in-video quizzes to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive programming exercises. Each mini-course also includes a discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Databases course.
