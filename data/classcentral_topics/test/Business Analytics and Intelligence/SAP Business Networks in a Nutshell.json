To keep up with the demands and expectations of consumers and business buyers, companies must connect, interact, and integrate on previously unknown and unexpected levels. SAP’s business network group addresses precisely that demand, using cloud-based solutions that deliver connectivity, efficiency, affordability, and a great user experience on any device, any time.\r\nAriba, Concur, and Fieldglass – the three companies that make up SAP’s Business Network Group – look beyond the four walls of a business to integrate and connect systems, services, partners, and data to create more efficient, more powerful, and far simpler means of managing key business functions. They provide the outcome and experience business users need via seamless platforms.\r\nIn this course, we’ll learn more about the Business Network Group and the three companies that comprise it.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: Introduction to Business NetworksUnit 2: Ariba: Leading the World's Business Commerce NetworkUnit 3: Network Collaboration – Driving Buyer and Seller ValueUnit 4: Fieldglass: The Future of Workforce ManagementUnit 5: Connecting the Dots Between Human Resources and ProcurementUnit 6: Concur: Travel and Expense Management Made SimpleUnit 7: An Expense Report That Writes Itself\n                                    ",
