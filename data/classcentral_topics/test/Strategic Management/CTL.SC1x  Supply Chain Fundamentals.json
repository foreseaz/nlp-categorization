Companies need supply chain experts to create and maintain a strategic competitive advantage. This course is the first course offered as part of MIT's MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management.\n\nThis supply chain management course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.\n\nThe main topic areas we will focus on are:\n\n\n\tDemand Forecasting, Planning, and Management\n\t\n\t\n\tInventory Planning, Management, and Control\n\t\n\t\n\tTransportation Planning, Management, and Execution\n\t\nWhile our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.\n\nThe MITx MicroMasters Credential is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting and growing field. In addition to being a stand-alone certificate demonstrating expertise in the field, students who complete all of the required courses and the final proctored exam will be qualified to apply to gain credit at MIT for the blended graduate master's degree program. In order to qualify for the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management you need to earn a Verified Certificate in all of the required courses. When you register for a Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to additional practice problems, supplemental readings, and opportunities for increased interaction with the faculty and teaching staff. \n\n                                    ",
