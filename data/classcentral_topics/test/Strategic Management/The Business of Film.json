The studios are where Star Wars: Episode VII – the Force Awakens and the 24th James Bond film Spectre were recently filmed.\n\nUsing the value chain concept and important independent film case studies, the course provides a practical and in-depth exploration of the key business decisions.\n\nWhy do films fail? Why are intellectual property and copyright important? Why do films get public funding? What is the relationship between marketing, box office returns and overall film success?\n\nAs well as providing step-by-step guidance on the main processes, this course will also discuss these fascinating questions.\n\nJoin us to gain an understanding of the questions you should be asking and the relationships you need to build to ensure the smooth running of your production.\n\n\n                                    ",
