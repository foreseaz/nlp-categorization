The role of the customer during a service development process is another important focus of this course.   \r\nThe course centers around open collaborative and networked learning practices. It makes use of freely available social media tools that do not require extensive technical skills to be mastered and implemented. \r\nWe regard learning as a constructive, collaborative, self-directed and contextual process and believe that using the emerging ideas of networked learning is the way forward for lifelong learning. One major intention in designing the course this way is to develop a community of practice around the course content as well as research at the Service Research Center  (CTF).\r\nThe course encourages and nurtures rich interaction through a number of open spaces such as our Twitter hashtag (#msi151), and our participant blog hub. The open nature of the course and the sharing that it inspires, benefits current and future participants, especially as the goal of the course is to foster and develop long-term, authentic, professional connections.\n\n                                    ",
