The Three Pillar model in this course expands this model by adding strategy in place of economics.  With this change, the model becomes a practical framework that you can use to make all types of decisions—business, leadership and personal.\n\nThis course uses business decision making to show you how to use the model.  In essence, to achieve business and career success, you must manage risk (the Law Pillar) and create value (the Strategy Pillar) in a responsible manner (the Ethics Pillar).\n\nBecause the Law Pillar is especially important and challenging, the course provides legal briefings (with many examples) on the key elements of business success, such as (1) attracting the best employees, (2) developing successful products, (3) creating new business models, (4) protecting intellectual property, (5) creating contracts that achieve business goals, and (6) using dispute resolution processes that improve business relationships. \n\nIn taking a global perspective in covering these elements, the course provides an introduction to the global business culture to learners from the United States, and an introduction to the US business culture to learners from outside the US. \n\nWith this background on the Law Pillar, after completing this course you should be able to:\n\n- Manage the key risks you face in business.\n- Create value for your business by linking the Law Pillar to the Strategy Pillar.\n- Use the Ethics Pillar to become a leader in creating or managing a business that serves the interests of society while creating profits for its shareholders.\n\nAfter you master the Three Pillar model for business decisions, you can easily apply the model to your personal decisions and to leadership decisions in non-business settings.\n\nHow to successfully complete this course (4 steps):\n\n(1) Watch the short videos for each module.  The videos are interactive and include questions to test your understanding of the Three Pillars model.  You can watch them week-by-week or you can binge watch them.  Someone who binge-watched my first MOOC (“Successful Negotiation:  Essential Strategies and Skills”) concluded “It’s as good as ‘Breaking Bad.’”\n\n(2) Do the readings.  The readings are short and designed to help you use the Three Pillar model in making everyday business decisions.  They reinforce the videos and add additional coverage. \n\n(3) “Show what you know” by taking the practice quizzes at the end of each module.\n\n(4) Take the final examination.  The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.   \n\nYou have the option of earning a Course Certificate through the verification of your identity and successful completion of the course.  A Certificate provides formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Michigan logo.  If you're considering getting a Course Certificate, you should complete the verification process before taking the Final Exam. You can choose to pay the associated fee before or after the exam.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to The Three Pillar Model for Business Decisions!This course will enable you to use the Three Pillar model to manage business risk and create value in an ethical manner.  You will also be able to use the model when making personal decisions.  After completing this introductory module, you will understand the course goal and game plan.Use the Three Pillar Model for Personal, Leadership and Business DecisionsIn this module you will learn the basic structure of the Three Pillar model and the importance of thinking globally in today’s business world.  You will also learn a practical decision making tool that you can begin to use immediately for personal and business decisions.  Suggestion: The videos are viewed by learners from around the world. English is not the primary language for many of these learners. As a result, when shooting the videos I have attempted to speak in a slow and deliberate manner. If English is your native language, I recommend that you increase the speed to at least 1.25x.\nUse Employment Law to Attract and Retain the Best Business TalentYour ability to attract and retain the best employees is essential to business success. This requires an understanding of employment law. The videos in this module cover two of the most important and controversial areas of employment law:  the ability of a business to fire employees and sex discrimination. After watching the videos, you will be able to manage employment risks in these areas, while also attracting the best talent to your business.  Meet Your Customers’ Needs: Transform Product Liability into Product InnovationIn a fast-changing world, your ability to develop new products is an important source of competitive advantage.  The videos in this module provide you with methods for managing product liability risks.  You can use these same methods for consumer research and new product development. \nCreate Business Opportunities Through Government RegulationGovernment regulation plays an important role in determining the success of businesses around the world.  In this module you will learn how to manage government regulatory risk by shaping the law and through compliance.  You will also learn how to create business opportunities by anticipating regulation (the Regulatory Frontier Strategy) and by developing business models based on gaps in regulation (the Regulatory Gap Strategy).  \nUse Your Intellectual Property to Create Shareholder ValueWhether you are an entrepreneur starting your own business or a manager in a major international corporation, intellectual property is one of your key business assets.  In this module, guest lecturer Susan Kornfield, a leading intellectual property lawyer, will explain how to create, protect and use your intellectual property in the US and internationally.  The module is divided into the four key areas of intellectual property:  trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and patents.  Although these areas can be technical and complex, she brings them to life with many fascinating examples.  Each of the four sections concludes with a summary of a lawyer’s perspective on intellectual property (which tends to focus on risk management) and a business perspective (which focuses on value creation). \nDevelop Contracts that Create Value for Both SidesSuccessful contracts are the key to value creation for businesses.  This module provides a contracting checklist of the key elements anyone in business should understand when negotiating contracts.  These elements are necessary to minimize risk by creating a “perfect” contract.  However, because a legally perfect contract can also be harmful to business success, the module also covers how to focus your contracts on business objectives and how to visualize contract terms to increase your understanding. \nUse Dispute Resolution Processes for Value CreationThis module focuses on the processes that you will use to resolve disputes and build relationships that are key to business success.  Short videos demonstrate arbitration and mediation processes.   The module includes discussion of practical management tools you can use immediately to manage risks relating to business disputes:  a corporate pledge, screens, contract clauses, and online resources.  The module also shows you how to dispute resolution for value creation, including using the power of apology and a life goals analysis. \nCreate and Lead an Ethical BusinessThis module focuses on the Ethics Pillar of decision making by addressing three questions that are important to your career success:  (1) What decision-making process should you use when facing an ethical dilemma?  (2)  What guidelines should you consider when analyzing the dilemma?  (3)  How can your best serve as an ethical leader in you organization?  In answering these questions, the module shows how you can use the Law Pillar and the Strategy Pillar to embed ethical standards into your business and create an ethical organization.  Final ExaminationThis module includes the final examination, including both the relevant instructions and honor code.  \n                                    ",
