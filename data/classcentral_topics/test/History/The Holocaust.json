Students will explore\n    memoirs, historical documents, poetry, documentary footage, filmic representations,\n    novels, and other media that help to illustrate the multiplicity and variety\n    of human experience during this important historical episode.\nBy the end of the course, you will have an expanded knowledge and understanding\n    of Eastern and Western Jewish communities, the origins and development\n    of antisemitism, the formation and operation of concentration camps, the\n    resistance movements, and the Holocaust as a problem for world-history.\n    Additionally, you will have engaged with the problematics of representation,\n    memory, \"the memorial\", and witnessing.\n\nThis course is supported by the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust\n    studies.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1 - Emancipation, Acculturation, and Assimilation\n\nReadings:\nTec, Nehama.
