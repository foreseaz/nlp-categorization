It was always part of a global\neconomy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that\nspanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the\npolitical and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental\nempire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be\ndestroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power.\n\nWhy that was – why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s – is a\nmatter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the\ncourse. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of\nthe U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its\nhistory as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860.\nThis course is about the ethical and political questions that history\nnecessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and\ndemocracy in U.S. and world history.  It is about the rise and fall\nof the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of\nthe American Civil War.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One (January 19-January 25)Lecture 1: New Worlds in the Making Lecture 2: Slavery and the Making of the Atlantic WorldReadings﻿﻿﻿Olaudah Equiano, The Interesting Life of Olaudah Equiano; Or, Gustavus Vassa (1789).
