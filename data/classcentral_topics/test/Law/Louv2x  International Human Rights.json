The result is a unique human rights grammar, which this course shall discuss and question, examining the sources of human rights, the rights of individuals and the duties of States, and the mechanisms of protection. We shall rely extensively on comparative material from different jurisdictions, to study a wide range of topics including, for instance, religious freedom in multicultural societies, human rights in employment relationships, economic and social rights in development, or human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism.\n\n                                    ",
