The rules contained in this revolutionary new Act are now mandatory for all offices/workplaces and not complying with these norms can lead to serious legal ramifications.\r\n \r\n \r\nOften, because of lack of awareness or gender sensitisation training, employees/managers may do or say things inadvertently without realising that they amount to sexual harassment under the law.\r\n \r\nThis Massive Open Online Course (“MOOC”), created in partnership with the Centre for Social Research, will provide the learner with a fundamental understanding of this Act in a simple, concise and comprehensive manner. It will trace the development of case law in India through judicial activism. In this context, we will also take a brief look at important judgments such as Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan and Medha Kotwal Lele v. Union of India.\r\n \r\nIt will introduce the mechanisms and procedures instituted by the Act to enable a safe working environment for women. We will then study the various remedies available, including civil and criminal remedies, under the Act and other applicable laws as well.\r\n \r\nAwareness of the new law on sexual harassment is a must for anyone working in any organisation. Take this free MOOC to understand what constitutes sexual harassment at the workplace and how the law deals with it.\n\n                                    ",
