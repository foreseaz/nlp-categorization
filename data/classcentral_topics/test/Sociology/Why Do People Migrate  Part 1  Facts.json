It then analyses specific cases in the most relevant geographical contexts, including the asylum seekers arriving in Europe through the Mediterranean, the undocumented Mexican migrants crossing the US border, the Syrian refugees in Turkey and the Rohingya in Australia. In discussing these cases, we will explore the dilemmas behind humanitarian protection and irregular migration for labour purposes.\r\nThe course is based on video lectures, didactic videos and podcast interviews with international experts. Assignments consist of short quizzes for each unit and a journal exercise at the end of the course. Suggestions for further reading will be included in order to achieve a more in-depth understanding.\r\nTo learn more about the theories that explain international migration, check out Part 2: Theories\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTIONUnit 1.1 – What are irregular migration and asylum?Unit 1.2 – Let us talk about words!\r\nCHAPTER 2 – EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EASTUnit 2.1 – Irregular border crossings towards the EUUnit 2.2 – Refugee status in EuropeUnit 2.3 – The case of Syrian refugees in Turkey\r\nCHAPTER 3 – AMERICASUnit 3.1 – Irregular Latin-American migrants in US agricultureUnit 3.2 – Gender and irregular migration in Latin America\r\nCHAPTER 4 – ASIA AND OCEANIAUnit 4.1 – Maritime arrivals in AustraliaUnit 4.2 – The case of Rohingya refugees\n                                    ",
