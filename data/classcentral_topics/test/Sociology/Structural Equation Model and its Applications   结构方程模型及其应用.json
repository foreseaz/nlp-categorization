However, China is geographically too large.  Even if I conduct free workshops at remote cities, a lot of students still cannot pay for the travel expenses to attend.  Therefore, I am now making publicly available an original web course that is used by our own students. I hope all Chinese students can now enjoy this course with plenty of exercises to monitor their learning. As most of the course content concentrates on the explanation and applications of theories, the course should be useful for students who intend to use LISREL or other software.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1 Introduction 简介Lesson 2 Exploratory vs. Confirmatory Factor Analysis 探索性与验证性因子分析Lesson 3 Basic Concepts 原理Lesson 4 CFA overview 验证性因子分析(概述)Lesson 4 CFA in details 验证性因子分析Lesson 5 Multitrait-Multimethod Model 多质多法模型Lesson 6 Full Model 全模型Lesson 7 High-Order Factor Analysis 高阶因子分析Lesson 8 Simplex Model 单纯形模型Lesson 9 Multiple-Group SEM 多组SEM分析Lesson 10 Issues in Model Specification and Analysis 结构方程建模和分析步骤Lesson 11 Issues on Data 涉及数据的问题Lesson 12 How to Read SPSS.sav into LISREL 读取SPSS数据\n                                    ",
