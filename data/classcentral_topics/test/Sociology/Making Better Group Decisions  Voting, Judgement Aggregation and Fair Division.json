Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others\nin small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when\nwe carefully examine our group decision-making processes. There are two types of group\ndecision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose\nthat a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which\nrestaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where\nto go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a\nchoice that is “fair” taking into account everyone’s opinions or must we choose one person\nfrom the group to act as a “dictator”? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake and\na group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces\nto the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with\nvanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece\nthat is the same size. But, how do we find a “fair” division of the cake if it is heterogeneous\n(e.g., icing that is 1/3 chocolate, 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want\ndifferent parts of the cake? \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:  Voting Methods\n\n    The Voting Problem\n    A Quick Introduction to Voting Methods (e.g., Plurality Rule, Borda Count,  \n              Plurality with Runoff, The Hare System, Approval Voting)    \n    Preferences \n    The Condorcet Paradox\n    How Likely is the Condorcet Paradox?\n    Condorcet Consistent Voting Methods\n    Approval Voting\n    Combining Approval and Preference\n    Voting by Grading\n\n \n\n\n\nWeek 2: Voting Paradoxes\n\n    Choosing How to Choose\n    Condorcet's Other Paradox\n    Should the Condorcet Winner be Elected?\n    Failures of Monotonicity\n    Multiple-Districts Paradox\n    Spoiler Candidates and Failures of Independence\n    Failures of Unanimity\n    Optimal Decisions or Finding Compromise?\n    Finding a Social Ranking vs. Finding a Winner\n\n\n\nWeek 3: Characterizing Voting Methods\n\n    Classifying Voting Methods\n    The Social Choice Model\n    Anonymity, Neutrality and Unanimity\n    Characterizing Majority Rule\n    Characterizing  Voting Methods\n    Five Characterization Results\n    Distance-Based Characterizations of Voting Methods\n    Arrow's Theorem\n    Proof of Arrow's Theorem\n    Variants of Arrow's Theorem\n\n\n \n\n    Week 4: Topics in Social Choice Theory\n\n\n\n    Introductory Remarks\n    Domain Restrictions: Single-Peakedness\n    Sen’s Value Restriction\n    Strategic Voting\n    Manipulating Voting Methods\n    Lifting Preferences\n    The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem\n    Sen's Liberal Paradox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Week 5: Aggregating Judgements\n\n\n    Voting in Combinatorial Domains\n    Anscombe's Paradox\n    Multiple Elections Paradox\n    The Condorcet Jury Theorem\n    Paradoxes of Judgement Aggregation\n    The Judgement Aggregation Model\n    Properties of Aggregation Methods\n    Impossibility Results in Judgement Aggregation\n    Proof of the Impossibility Theorem(s)\n\n\n\n\n    Week 6: Fair Division \n    Introduction to Fair Division\n    Fairness Criteria  \n    Efficient and Envy-Free Divisions\n    Finding an Efficient and Envy Free Division\n    Help the Worst Off or Avoid Envy?\n    The Adjusted Winner Procedure\n    Manipulating the  Adjusted Winner Outcome\nWeek 7:  Cake-Cutting Algorithms \n\n   The Cake Cutting Problem\n   Cut and Choose \n\n\n   Equitable and Envy-Free Proocedures\n   Proportional Procedures\n   The Stromquist Procedure\n   The Selfridge-Conway Procedure\n   Concluding Remarks\n\n\n\n    \n\n                                    ",
