Featuring interviews with top scholars and discussion of the full-length award winning documentary, China Blue, which follows the life of a young seventeen-year-old worker from Sichuan province, to a Chinese jeans factory, this course will transform your perspective on yourself and others.\n\nNo previous knowledge required. Global Sociology is highly recommended.\n\nImage: Ganesh Ramachandran | www.purpleganesh.com\n\n                                    ",
