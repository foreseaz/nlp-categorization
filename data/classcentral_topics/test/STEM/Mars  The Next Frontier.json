Students will work collaboratively on international teams to create a simulated, sustainable outpost on Mars. The course is comprised of five modules, and participants will hear from experts in the areas of clean water, renewable energy, clean air, food and nutrition, and Mars. Each team will be challenged to research and apply 21st century learning skills to the environmental elements of Mars while developing viable solutions that will make life on the Red Planet suitable for humans. Completion of the course will culminate in a conference where participants will engage in a simulated and completely immersive Martian learning experience at Space Center Houston.\n\n                                    ",
