To respond to this, governments are including computing in national curricula for students of all ages. In the UK already every primary school teacher has to teach computing concepts and in many other countries more and more of us will be required to teach computing or at least integrate computing concepts, ideas and processes into our teaching. So let's get ready for this.If you are a primary or secondary school teacher who needs ideas, tools or resources on how to teach computing, this MOOC is here to help you. The course is designed as an introductory course, for you to use as a starting point to explore some of the ideas and tools further. It is relevant to primary and secondary school teachers of all levels of experience. A basic amount of knowledge on operating computers and other technology devices is expected but you don't need prior knowledge of computing. The course lasts for 5 weeks and requires around 3 hours of work per week.The course has been designed by teachers for teachers and will feature interviews, presentations, and activities from teachers, professors, students and computing professionals.Enrol in the course and join the discussion on our social media channels via the Facebook group and Twitter using #CScourse.This course is an adapted version of the two courses How to Teach Computing: An Introduction to Concepts, Tools and Resources for Secondary/Primary Teachers. If you have previously completed one of these courses you will be familiar with the content of this course and while you are welcome to join again, it is unlikely to offer you anything new.\n\n                                    ",
