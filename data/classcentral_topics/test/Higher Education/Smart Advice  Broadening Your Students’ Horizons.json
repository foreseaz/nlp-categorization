By the end, you will understand:\n\n•\tthe different progression pathways available to students;\n•\tthe subjects and courses available in UK higher education;\n•\tand the benefits of using an online course and taking part in social learning.\n\nLearn with UCAS experts and other advisors globally\n\nThe course has been developed by UCAS – the admissions service for all UK higher education institutions – and UCAS staff will act as tutors, to provide feedback and to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nBut you will also join a community of online learners, providing an opportunity for interactive learning with other advisers both in the UK and internationally.\n\nSupport your students with a complementary course\n\nThis course complements Smart Choices: Broadening Your Horizons – another free online course developed by UCAS, which will be available soon. Designed for young people in school, it will help them discover more about their post-18 options and pathways, and explore the wide range of subjects and opportunities offered in higher education.\n\n\n                                    ",
