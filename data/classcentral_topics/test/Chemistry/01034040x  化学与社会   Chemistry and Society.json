The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development.\n\nThe main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life.\n\nChemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born.\n\nChemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.\n\nThe purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a \"tourist spaceship\", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.\n\n                                    ",
