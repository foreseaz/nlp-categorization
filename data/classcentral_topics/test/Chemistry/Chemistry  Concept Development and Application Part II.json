The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The course includes 9 weeks of instruction.
