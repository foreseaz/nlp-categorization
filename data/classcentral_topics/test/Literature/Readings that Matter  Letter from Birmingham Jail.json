This series is adapted from a set of readings that Acumen’s Fellows and staff discuss on a regular basis as part of our leadership training and development.\r\n“INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE…”\r\nWe have chosen to start with Martin Luther King’s most widely-read text “Letter from Birmingham Jail” because the themes are particularly relevant today. As we become more interconnected as a world, we see a growing sense of otherness and awareness of injustices. This is true in the United States and across the world. Through a systematic reading and discussion of Martin Luther King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” with a group of people you know, you will explore his arguments, dissect his masterful use of rhetoric, and we hope, come to a better understanding of where you stand on the various ideas he shares.\r\nYOU'LL LOVE THIS COURSE IF\r\n\r\nYou’re a leader or aspiring leader looking to learn from a master of moral imagination with the humility to see the world as it is and the audacity to imagine what it could be.\r\nYou’re looking to learn powerful techniques to confront injustice and speak truth to power.\r\nYou enjoy discussing issues of justice, leadership, and the systems in which we live.\r\n\r\nHOW THE COURSE WORKS\r\nThis 1-module course is probably more akin to a book club.  Its power comes from the group’s experience of the reading and discussion.\r\n\r\nGet a group of people together.  We recommend starting with 3-5 people you know – your friends, family, classmates, or colleagues.\r\nHave each person you invite sign up individually here to receive the reading.\r\nYour group session will work best if someone takes the lead as a facilitator.  We’ve made this easy by providing a full facilitator’s guide (including email templates to invite your friends) which will be emailed to you upon registration.\r\nSet a date to meet in-person (recommended) or online.\r\n\r\nTo start, we suggest setting aside 1 hour to read the letter and then 2 hours for your group’s discussion.  From our past experience, it is quite likely that your group will not get through the full reading in that time.  Because of this we have made the course materials available on demand so that you don’t have to complete them in one sitting.\n\n                                    ",
