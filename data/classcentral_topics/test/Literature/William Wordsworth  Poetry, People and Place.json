This course is presented in association with the Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere.\n\nDiscover how Wordsworth wrote his best-known works\n\nThe course has been filmed at Dove Cottage, Grasmere, where Wordsworth lived from 1799 to 1808.\n\nThere, he produced much of his greatest work, including “I wandered lonely as a Cloud” (perhaps better known as “Daffodils”) and The Prelude (his autobiographical masterpiece).\n\nYou will study how Wordsworth created and revised these poems and Lyrical Ballads, drawing on the magnificent collection of manuscripts held by the Wordsworth Trust in the museum next to his home.\n\nExplore the Lake District with leading Wordsworth scholars\n\nThrough readings and discussions focusing on Grasmere and the landscape of the Lake District, the course will explore why this location was so important for Wordsworth.\n\nContributors to the course will include Jeff Cowton, the Curator of the Wordsworth Trust, and Professor Sally Bushell, one of the world’s leading scholars of Wordsworth’s writing process, who is based at Lancaster University on the doorstep of the Lake District.\n\nYou can find out more in Simon Bainbridge’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “How does a great poet write his poetry?”\n\nNature’s Poets: what place inspires your poetry?\nTo celebrate the start of Lancaster University’s free online course we’re challenging you to write a poem inspired by your favourite place.
