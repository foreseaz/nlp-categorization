This free online course aims to prepare teachers to deliver the new curriculum effectively to children in years 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n\nWith a mixture of subject knowledge and pedagogical advice, this course is aimed at both ICT specialists and Primary teaching non-specialists. Expert ‘Master Teachers’ from Computing at School have designed the course to make sure teachers have the most up-to-date information which they can take into their classrooms and teach great Computing lessons.\n\nThis is Part 2 of the course, but you can take it even if you didn’t do Part 1.\n\nThis course is aimed at teachers in primary and secondary schools, especially those teaching in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3. The aim is to support teachers in developing the skills they need to teach the new curriculum. There is subject knowledge guidance as well as advice about planning, teaching and assessing pupil learning.\n\nOn this course you will have the chance to work with other teachers and experts in a flexible, self-paced learning environment.\n\n\n                                    ",
