The library itself has changed to include learning spaces and zones with less dedicated space for print resources. In this course, an experienced academic librarian will share his strategies for getting students engaged in the art of library research. Heâ€™ll provide a balanced approach to information literacy instruction, which will include games, active learning, and other ways to use media literacy to help students enjoy their time in the library.\n\n                                    ",
