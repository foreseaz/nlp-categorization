We'll introduce the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and cover how next-generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. You'll also get an introduction to the key concepts in computing and data science that you'll need to understand how data from next-generation sequencing experiments are generated and analyzed.  \n\nThis is the first course in the Genomic Data Science Specialization.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        OverviewIn this Module, you can expect to study topics of \"Just enough molecular biology\", \"The genome\", \"Writing a DNA sequence\", \"Central dogma\", \"Transcription\", \"Translation\", and \"DNA structure and modifications\".Measurement TechnologyIn this module, you'll learn about polymerase chain reaction, next generation sequencing, and applications of sequencing.Computing TechnologyThe lectures for this module cover a few basic topics in computing technology. We'll go over the foundations of computer science, algorithms, memory and data structures, efficiency, software engineering, and computational biology software.Data Science TechnologyIn this module on Data Science Technology, we'll be covering quite a lot of information about how to handle the data produced during the sequencing process. We'll cover reproducibility, analysis, statistics, question types, the central dogma of inference, analysis code, testing, prediction, variation, experimental design, confounding, power, sample size, correlation, causation, and degrees of freedom.\n                                    ",
