This course will teach you how to make emotionally moving recordings on almost any recording equipment, including your phone or laptop. The emphasis is on mastering tangible artistic concepts; the gear you use is up to you. You will learn to develop the most important tool in the recording studio: your ears. You will learn to enhance every aspect of your own productions, both sonically and musically, by employing deeper listening skills. \n\nAssignments will include posting your own recordings for peer review, and reviewing your classmates’ work by employing specific tools and strategies. If you use a digital audio workstation to record and mix, that’s great, but as long as you can record into your computer and post an MP3, you can complete the assignments. \n\nAs you learn about the art of record production in this 4-week course, you will also learn about yourself and who you are as an artist and producer. It is not necessary that you read music or play an instrument to take this course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to The Art of Music ProductionWelcome to The Art of Music Production!

You’ll acquire skills in prosody, focus, and an intelligent approach to repetition.  You’ll also learn to craft better melodies, write better lyrics, and construct a musical form that best suits the emotional contour you are trying to accomplish with your recording.  You’ll understand the principles of getting the most out of feedback on your recordings, in order to gather valuable perspective to better convey your intended response.  You’ll incorporate notes from your colleagues to further refine your recording and re-post an updated version.Defining the Sonic Signature of your SongBy the end of this lesson, you will address the sonic signature as it relates to your intention and vision, as well as your technology resources and acoustic space.
