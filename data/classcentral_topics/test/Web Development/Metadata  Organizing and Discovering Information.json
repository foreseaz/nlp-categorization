You interacted with metadata about your account. Searched\nfor songs in iTunes or Spotify? You used metadata about those songs. We\nuse and even create metadata constantly, but we rarely realize it. Metadata\n-- or data about data -- describes real and digital objects, so that those\nobjects may be organized now and found later.\n\nMetadata is a tool that enables the information age functions performed\nby humans as well as those performed by computers. Metadata is important\nto many fields, particularly Computer Science; but this course is not purely\na Computer Science course. This course approaches Metadata from the perspective\nof Information Science, which is a broad interdisciplinary field that studies\nhow people create and manage information.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: Organizing Information\nUnit 2: Dublin Core\nUnit 3: How to Build a Metadata Schema\nUnit 4: Alphabet Soup: Metadata Schemas That You (Will) Know and Love\nUnit 5: Metadata for the Web\nUnit 6: Metadata for Networks\nUnit 7: How to Create Metadata\nUnit 8: How to Evaluate Metadata\n                                    ",
