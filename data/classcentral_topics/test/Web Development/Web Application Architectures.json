Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available. You can find the  complete list here.\n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                Read this guide to learn how to download this course before the old platform shuts down. \n\n                                The guide provides two ways to download the courses - Chrome Plugin and Python Script. Depending on which method you use, check the appropriate sections below for further details.\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                To download this course you need to be enrolled in the course.\n                                                                Unfortunately this course is closed for enrollment to new students.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    webapplications-001\n                                                                    webapplications-002\n                                                                    webapplications-003\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This course explores the development of web application architectures from an engineering perspective.  We will consider the fundamental design patterns and philosophies associated with modern web application architectures, along with their major components.  By the end of this course, I expect you to be able to:Design, develop and deploy a modern web application.  This course is not about how to build a pretty web page, it's about how to build and deploy the full stack of protocols and technologies associated with a complete web app.  That said, it is not possible for you to become an expert in this area in a few weeks. My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together.  Modern web apps are complex.  A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack.  Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.Use Ruby on Rails.  We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRails is a framework for creating web\napplications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language. I believe this is one of the best frameworks\nfor learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful as\na platform for commercial offerings. \nThat said, there are many other frameworks available, and the concepts\nyou will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter understand modern software engineering\npractice.  We’ll be using the latest tools and practices in\nsoftware development, source code control, testing, and application\ndeployment. This will include exposure\nto agile development practices, the numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and the cloud-based resources that are\nbecoming increasingly important in web applications.      \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                         Week One – Module 1: Introduction and Background   Lecture 1: Historical Perspective  Lecture 2: What is a Web Application?  Lecture 3: Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 Application Architectures  Lecture 4: Design Patterns  Lecture 5: Setting up Your Development EnvironmentWeek Two – Module 2: Ruby on Rails  Lecture 1: Rails Overview  Lecture 2: Your First Rails App  Lecture 3: The Blog App – Iteration 1  Lecture 4: Rails Philosophy  Lecture 5: Version Control  Lecture 6: Git and RailsWeek Three – Module 3: Database Interactions  Lecture 1: Relational Databases  Lecture 2: Databases in Rails  Lecture 3: The Active Record Design Pattern  Lecture 4: The Blog App – Iteration 2 (Associations)  Lecture 5: The Blog App – Iteration 3 (Validations)Week Four – Module 4: The Ruby Programming Language  Lecture 1: Ruby Background  Lecture 2: Classes and Inheritance  Lecture 3: Objects and Variables  Lecture 4: Strings, Regular Expressions and Symbols  Lecture 5: Expressions and Control Structures  Lecture 6: Collections, Blocks and IteratorsWeek Five – Module 5: Middleware  Lecture 1: What is Middleware?  Lecture 2: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – Introduction  Lecture 3: HTTP – Request  Lecture 4: HTTP – Response  Lecture 5: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern  Lecture 6: Rails Controllers – Request Handling  Lecture 7: Rails Controllers – Response  Lecture 8: MVC Implementation in Rails  Lecture 9: The Blog App – Iteration 4Week Six – Module 6: Presentation/User Interface  Lecture 1: Introduction and Background  Lecture 2: HTML – Basic Syntax  Lecture 3: HTML – Document Structure  Lecture 4: HTML – Forms  Lecture 5: Dynamic Content  Lecture 6: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)  Lecture 7: JavaScript and jQuery  Lecture 8: Ajax  Lecture 9: The Blog App – Iteration 5\n                                    ",
