Hollywood found\nways both to reflect reality and deflect misery as decade after decade, movies adjusted a basic formula to audience needs.\n\nFilm clips and still photographs will illustrate how films defined marriage in the movies, identified a core seven problems, and varied its three narrative components -- a couple, their problems, their situation -- from decade to decade from the silent\nto the modern era.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        5 weeks, 10 films, 22 lecturesWEEK I\nIntroductionLecture 1: An Overview on Marriage and the MoviesLecture 2: Hollywood and MarriageLecture 3: The Silent EraLecture 4: The Silent Era part IIFilm 1: WILD ORCHIDS (Franklin, 1929) (Warner Archive / Amazon)Lecture 5: Defining the Marriage MovieFilm 2: MADE FOR EACH OTHER (Cromwell, 1939) (Amazon)WEEK 2\nLecture 6: The \"I Do\" and \"I Don't\" versionsFilm 3: THE MARRYING KIND (Cukor, 1952) (Amazon)Lecture 7: Variations and Vignettes\nLecture 8: The CoupleLecture 9: The Couple part IIFilm 4: ADAM'S RIB (Cukor, 1949) (Amazon)\nWEEK 3\nLecture 10: The Seven Recurring ProblemsLecture 11: Money and InfidelityFilm 5: BRIEF ENCOUNTER (Lean, 1945) (Amazon)Lecture 12: The Infidelity Story Over TimeLecture 13: In-laws/Kids and Class/IncompatibilityLecture 14: Incompatibility continuedFilm 6: VIVACIOUS LADY (Stevens, 1938) (Warner Archive / Amazon)\nWEEK 4\nLecture 15: Addiction/MurderFilm 7: SUSPICION (Hitchcock, 1941) (Amazon)Lecture 16: The SituationLecture 17: WWII Marriage MoviesFilm 8: SINCE YOU WENT AWAY (Cromwell, 1944) (Amazon)\nWEEK 5\nLecture 18: Post-WWII, TVLecture 19: Post-war continuedLecture 20: \"The Modern Era\" Film 9: HEARTBURN (Nichols, 1986) (Amazon)\nLecture 21: State of the Marriage Movie - \"Nuclear\" Marriages, Social ChangeFilm 10: THE WAR OF THE ROSES (DeVito, 1989) (Amazon)Lecture 22: Conclusions\n\n\nAssignments:\nMultiple-choice quizzes during/after each lecture (ungraded)Longer cumulative multiple-choice quiz at the end\n(graded)Online discussion opportunities\n\n                                    ",
