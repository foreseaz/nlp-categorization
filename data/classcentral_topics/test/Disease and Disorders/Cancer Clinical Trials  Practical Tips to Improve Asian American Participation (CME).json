Asian Americans, like other ethnic groups, have low recruitment, accrual and retention rates in cancer clinical trials. This represents a significant challenge on a national level for health advocates, healthcare institutions and the National Cancer Institute. To improve communication and awareness of clinical trials for Asian American patients, it is important to increase learners’ knowledge about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility. This online course will educate healthcare providers and allied health professionals about cancer clinical trials and cultural humility skills as well as provide educational resources and tips for reinforcing change in practice to improve outcomes in Asian American clinical trial participation.\r\n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionClinical Trials Basics (13:51)Cultural Competence, Cultural Humility, &amp; Clinical Trials Recruitment (14:20)Changing Your Practice to Increase Asian American Participation in Cancer Clinical Trials (12:45)Course Wrap-upReferences and ResourcesHelp!\n                                    ",
