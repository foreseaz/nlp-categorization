It covers a range of topics including basic brain anatomy, pathology, dementia research, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, medical management, living with dementia, progression and staging, palliation, behaviours and therapeutic approaches.\r\nThe content is delivered by 15 experts in the field of dementia including neuroscientists, health scientists, clinicians, dementia care professionals and people living with dementia.\r\nParticipants will have an opportunity to engage with the material via video clips, activities, games, scenarios and quizzes. Furthermore, they will have an opportunity to meet an international network of peers online to discuss the key issues surrounding dementia.\n\n                                    ",
