This can cause significant health problems – heart disease is one of the biggest killers in the UK and an estimated 17 million people die of cardiovascular disease each year worldwide.\n\nHeart disease is something that touches many lives, but can be difficult to understand.\n\nAn introduction to heart health\n\nThis four-week course aims to improve your knowledge of how the heart works, the effects of heart disease and what you can do to avoid it. We’ll explore the anatomy of the heart, explaining how the circulatory system works and what it does.\n\nWe’ll then introduce some of the most common cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. We’ll help you understand their effects on the body, why they happen and what can be done to prevent them. We’ll also highlight some wonderful resources from the British Heart Foundation including up to date statistics, patient leaflets and videos describing many of the tests that cardiac patients undergo.\n\nIn the final week, we’ll examine the risk factors for heart disease and what you can do keep your heart healthy.\n\nHands-on exercises to understand your own heart\n\nEach week you’ll have the opportunity to get hands on and do a practical activity, helping you to apply the knowledge you’ll gain on the course, to better understand your own heart.\n\nYou can find out more about these activities in Natasha Barrett’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “A heart in your hands.”\n\n\n                                    ",
