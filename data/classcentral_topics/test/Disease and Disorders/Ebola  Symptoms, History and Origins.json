We’ll also be tracing the current outbreak from its early cases to the most recent infections.\n\nOver two weeks, we’ll consider what can be done to stop the spread of the virus and how we can treat those infected, in terms of general care, drugs and vaccines.\n\nWe’ll also learn about the genetic structure of the virus, looking at some of its proteins; where it came from and where it may reside between outbreaks; and its evolutionary history.\n\nLearn through practical sessions and discussions\n\nThere will be practical sessions, using free software to do your own analysis on the virus, as well as discussions with guest academics: Thomas Keegan of Lancaster Medical School on aspects of epidemiology; and James Fraser of Lancaster Environment Centre on anthropology relevant to the outbreak.\n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to test the knowledge you acquire about Ebola with quizzes at the end of each week.\n\nDr Derek Gatherer has written about 2014’s Ebola outbreak on the FutureLearn blog, explaining where it came from and what it’s taught us.\n\nPhoto by ©EC/ECHO.\n\n\n                                    ",
