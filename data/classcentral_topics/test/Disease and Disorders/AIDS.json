If you did, chances are good that you came\nof age before 1981 and are a member of the last generation of humans on this\nplanet to be able to say that you remember those ‘carefree days when all you\nhad to worry about was getting pregnant, herpes, and a bad reputation’ (AID\nAtlanta).\n\nOn June 5, 1981 the CDC released a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report describing the first five cases\nof what later became known as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.\nOn that day human history broke into two generations: Those who can remember a time before the AIDS pandemic and those who can't.\n\nNo matter what generation you grew up in, what we all have\nin common is a curiosity about AIDS.  Where\ndid it come from? Why is it so widespread?  Are we making progress towards\na vaccine? What is it like to be part of a vaccine trial? Has anyone ever been cured of HIV infection? Are some people just\nnaturally more or less susceptible to HIV than other people\nare?\n\nAll of this and more will be covered in AIDS. Over the course of nine weeks we will discuss a wide range of\nissues, innovations, and controversies regarding HIV/AIDS in the US and around\nthe world including everything from what circumcision and Truvada have in\ncommon; how school children in Africa are changing the way AIDS education is\ndone; where you can go online to learn how many cases of AIDS there are in your\narea; and how one man’s insistence that AIDS doesn't exist left hundreds of thousands of people without access to life saving drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \nWeek 1: HISTORY: Focusing on the origin of HIV, its initial discovery in\nhumans, the early response to HIV (good, bad, and ugly), and its global spread\nsince then.\nLectures:\nDr. Hagen: The Origin of HIV\nGuest Lecture: \nDr. James W.
