In this introductory module, we welcome you to the course and inspire you with videos that introduce you to Penn State and get your creative muscles warmed up! Dive in and get started!CIC Mindset &amp; Innovation ToolboxCreativity, innovation, and change require a unique mindset and collection of mental tools. In this module, we will introduce you to the CIC mindset and to Intelligent Fast Failure (IFF) as a powerful tool for innovating. First, you will learn how to alter the way your brain works to produce ideas in the process called Mind Warping. Next, you will act to change your life and the world around you by fully using your own uniqueness. Finally, you will do what is considered impossible starting with little or no knowledge and few resources. Easy, right? Try it and see!  Understanding Creative DiversityWelcome to the world of creative diversity! In this module, you will discover that creativity comes in many different shapes and sizes, each of which is equally important in solving the world’s problems. Specifically, you will learn about four key variables that define and describe creative diversity, including your creative style and your creative level. You will also learn how creative diversity impacts the ideas you generate and how you make use of them, as well as how to recognize and appreciate the creative diversity of others around you.CENTER ModelIn this module, you will learn about the 6 practices of the CENTER model, which stands for Character, Excellence, owNership, Tenacity, Entrepreneurship, and Relationship. Each practice will move you closer to realizing the ideas you are generating and developing using the tools you’ve learned so far! To top things off, you will design your Life Ring with a partner and take your first action steps toward projects and ideas you are passionate about.Value CreationHow can you take your ideas and use them to create value? In this module, you will use the change equation (D x V x I = Change) to understand factors in big, impactful change. We will also show you the value of creating a memorable, lasting impression, symbol, or logo (a brand) for the change or product/service you create. Next, we’ll talk about social entrepreneurship and the importance of the context of change or new products and services. Finally, we’ll show you the 5 parts of the Action Map and how they work together, and you will use the Action Map to identify needs, pains, and ideas you may want to work on. ChangeCreativity and innovation involve many types of change, from small to large, incremental to radical, and slow to fast. In this last module of the course, you will become familiar with, and increase your awareness of, processes of change, so you can understand better the change path you are on. We’ll show you how to see the past, the present, and the future as a continuous whole, so you can recognize and create opportunities and take action to increase your creativity. This module will also help you deepen your learning from the previous modules and expand your understanding of change with your new CIC mindset and toolbox in mind. \n                                    ",
