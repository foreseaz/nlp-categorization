This \nfast-paced introduction to graphic design history will change your \nunderstanding of everything from fonts and letterforms to posters and \nbrands. Discover how printers revolutionized society when they created \nopen access to information. Explore the visual systems that inform \ngraphic design practice—from handwritten alphabets to online \npublications. Learn how avant-garde artists, architects, poets, and \npainters shook the world by reinventing mass media. Pursue the dream of a\n unified civilization held together by neutral typefaces, international \npictograms, and global brands—and see how subcultures rebelled against \ncultural uniformity by forging their own visual identities. Thinking \nabout history will open your eyes to new ideas and diverse practices. \nThe course is taught by Brockett Horne and Ellen Lupton, renowned \nauthors and leading faculty at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).\n In a series of dynamic conversations, they will introduce you to \nfascinating people and processes that changed the way we communicate. \nTest your knowledge with short quizzes, and stretch your own design \npractice by responding to inspiring creative prompts.Course image courtesy of Courtesy of the Letterform Archive, http://letterformarchive.org/\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1: The Visible Word The Invention of Writing, The Typographic Revolution, and Cultures of Publishing.\r\nSession 2: Liberated Style Arts and Crafts and the Ideal Book; Art Nouveau and Jugendstil.\r\nSession 3: Inventing The Avant-Garde Cubism, Futurism, Dada\r\nSession 4: New Typographies Constructivism, Dutch Modernism, and the Bauhaus.\r\nSession 5: International Styles International Symbols and Global Identities; The Postmodern Reaction.\r\nSession 6: Other Voices Design and Civil Rights; Race, Gender, Sexuality, and Universal Design\n                                    ",
