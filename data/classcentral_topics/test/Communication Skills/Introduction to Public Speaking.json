Similarly, educational success also requires the ability to articulate your thoughts clearly. In this class, we will study the principles of public speaking; critically examine our own and others’ speeches through interactive practice.\n\nUnlike many oral communication courses and textbooks, this class spends a fair bit of time working through the unique traits of oral versus written communication in order to help students prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally. The class's focus on understanding the key parts of an argument and drafting clear and concise arguments translates directly to other academic assignments. In service of this goal, we will study the principles of argumentation and arrangement; critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public speaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient Greece.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to Introduction to Public Speaking!Thank you for joining Introduction to Public Speaking! I am thrilled at the prospect of a global discussion about good speech. Let's get started!\n\nIn this module, we’ll focus on the basic of the course and how rhetoric will help us structure our time. Then we’ll turn to the important ways that speaking and writing differ. By the end of the module, you’ll be able to upload an introductory speech, if you wish. Designing Impromptu SpeechesNow that we have the course basics out of the way, we can work on our impromptu speeches. I love the impromptu speech. It's a simple two-point speech. As a model, it has tremendous flexibility. You can rely on this basic structure in a wide range of speech settings. After overviewing the assignment, we’ll talk about how to come up with main points and evidence. By the end of the module, you should have some solid tools for quickly putting together short presentations.  Delivering Impromptu SpeechesIn this module, we’ll start with a discussion of how to relate your support to your claims clearly and easily. Then, we'll turn to polishing your introductions and conclusions. We'll then discuss delivery and speech apprehension. I know the topic of public speaking fear is a pressing one for many. If you want some feedback, you’ll be able to upload an impromptu for peer review.Introduction to Informative Speaking!Having worked on the impromptu speech, we now turn to the informative speech. In our daily lives, we must often give informative presentations. Over the next few modules, we’ll explore some strategies for presenting information in a clear, effective, and engaging manner.\n\nIn this module, we’ll focus one the basics of the speaking assignment and some strategies for designing informative speeches. Designing Informative SpeechesIn this module, we'll move an informative speech from idea through to completed outline, with special attention to how to discuss evidence and detail in a way that augments a speech's clarity. This ability to explain details and evidence well is essential to scientific speaking, business presentation, and anytime you need to walk an audience through a complex set of ideas. Delivering Informative SpeechesThis is a big module since we’ll finish our work on informative speaking. We’ll begin by finalizing our informative speech outlines. Then, we turn our attention to ethos, which is such an important concept in public speaking since it blends together invention, style, and delivery. Finally, we’ll discuss more delivery tips for informative speaking. If you want some feedback, you’ll be able to upload an informative speech for peer review. Persuasive Speaking BasicsIn this module, we’ll focus one the basics of the persuasive speaking assignment and some strategies for designing persuasive speeches. Augustine held that eloquence required an ability to teach, delight, and move. We've covered teaching (the informative speech), so we now address delighting and moving.  In examining persuasive speaking, we tackle both solid argument and eloquent writing. The tools we'll use in the persuasive speech are useful in a wide range of contexts: workplace and civic settings. Moreover, we'll get deep into stylistic writing for high oratory. It’s a fun speech. Designing Persuasive SpeechesIn the last module, we started our work on the persuasive speech, ending with a discussion of stock issues. This module will move you from persuasive ideas to a completed argument and draft. Regardless of whether you are uploading a speech or not, I think everyone should spend some time familiarizing themselves with some of the argument strategies and fallacies discussed in this module. Globally, argumentation and reasoning would be better if everyone had a stronger grasp of these concepts.Delivering Persuasive SpeechesThis is a big module since we’ll finish our work on persuasive speaking. I love this content! In this module, we deal with language and style for motivational speaking. When people think about the most famous speeches in history, they tend to be thinking about stylistically rich speeches.   we’ll analyze and practice strategic and stylistic language use. Then we’ll end with some advanced discussion of vocal projection and some exercises for vocal health. If you want some feedback, you’ll be able to upload an persuasive speech for peer review. Course ConclusionCongratulations on making it to the final module. As a way of reflecting on the course as a whole, it will be useful to review the course objectives and your growth as a speaker. This was an entry-level course. My goal was to introduce you to some ideas about public speaking. Now comes the fun/challenging part, plotting your journey from here. I can make some recommendations about next steps in terms of practices and practice groups. \n                                    ",
