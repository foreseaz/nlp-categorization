Until now.\r\n \r\nIf you are new to negotiation, this course can be the foundation on which you will build your knowledge and skills. If you have some experience, this course will revisit for you the basic concepts, fold in some of the most recent thinking, and set up the next course.\r\n \r\nBy the end of this short course you will better understand:\r\n \r\n\r\nYour Current Negotiation Style: you will take the newest scored questionnaire on the 5 basic styles of negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnchoring Tactics: how a first offer works, or sometimes doesn’t work.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcession Patterns: how making concessions operates to best effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging Deception: whether by omission or commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurating Your Information: analyzing the information you do receive and identifying the type of information your counterpart is withholding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealing with Negative Emotion: how to work through the negative feelings that infect many negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture: how different views of the world, of business, and of negotiation will affect outcomes.\r\n\r\nYou will learn directly from an experienced Silicon Valley practitioner and teacher of negotiation. You will work with other students on discussion prompts, questions and exercises. You'll see feedback from your instructor across the course, including responses to questions from students. While key subjects of course receive significant treatment, almost all of the videos come in short (5-7 minute) modules. Complete the course and you will receive a certificate of completion and be given an opportunity to provide feedback on both this course, and our development of the next one.
