In the case of an epidemic, disaster, or armed conflict, how do experts determine what health care interventions to use? Is it possible to eradicate diseases like guinea worm and polio? How can health systems address their challenges?\n\nIn this course, learners will hear from leading experts as they engage with current issues and challenges in global health. The course will examine the global response to diseases, such as the developing Zika outbreak. The backbone of this learning experience is a set of 18 reviews, co-edited by David Hunter and Harvey Fineberg, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The combined reviews constitute an up-to-date survey of global health topics from authoritative leaders in the field, covering disease patterns and predictions, infectious and non-communicable diseases, and health systems and institutional responses.\n\nParticipants will read the reviews, hear from the authors through a series of interviews, and engage with the content and one another through assessments and discussion questions.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.
