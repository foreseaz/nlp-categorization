While responding to the current epidemic is critical, we also have an opportunity to learn lessons to prevent the next global health catastrophe, forge partnerships across borders and disciplines, and demonstrate our commitment to value all human lives.\n\nThis four-week course provides the context in which to understand the Ebola outbreak -- why now, and why did so many people suffer and die? The course lays out the global governance structure -- what was the global response supposed to look like, and where did it fail? \n\nThe course will feature practitioners, experts, and scholars who will focus on cultivating a better understanding of the Ebola epidemic and implications for future health systems to ensure that the world is more effective in preventing the next pandemic.\n\n                                    ",
