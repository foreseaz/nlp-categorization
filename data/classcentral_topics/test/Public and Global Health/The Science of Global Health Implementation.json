Develop problem-solving and analytical skills reflecting the trans-disciplinary nature of global health.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 0: WelcomeStudents will discover the MOOC, its organisation and its main objectives.They will be introduced to the notion of implementation science, its definition and how it can be a powerful tools for their research projects. They will discover practical examples of why we need implementation science.\r\nChapter 1: Preparing for changeStudents will discover how to prepare their organisation for change.Explanations will be given about the Lewin Stage Model, the theory of organisational readiness for change. Students will dive deeper into the topic with a case study.\r\nChapter 2: Designing changeStudents will discover design thinking, a systematic way of introducing innovation into an organisation.Many videos will present practical tools and methods (brainswarming, thinking hats, etc.). Design thinking will be illustrated with case presentation in the field of social innovation.\r\nChapter 3 : Implementing changeStudents will explore tools and methods to implement their innovative solution (Implementation drivers and stages as well as the Hexagon Tools).Students will dive deeper into the topic with a case study.\r\nChapter 4 : Sustaining changeStudents will explore how to ensure that implementation continues over time.They will discover key concepts such as the Run Charts, the wastes in Lean as well as the PDSA cycle and the Impact effort Matrix. A last cast study will be presented.\r\nChapter 5 : Final assessmentThe last chapter will be dedicated to the final assessment.\n                                    ",
