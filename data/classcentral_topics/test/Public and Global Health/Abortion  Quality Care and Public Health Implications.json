(Finer 2013) Around the world,\n43.8 million abortions were done in 2008 representing one fifth of all\npregnancies. (Sedgh 2012)  Abortion is\nsafe and has lower morbidity and mortality than childbirth when carried out by\ntrained practitioners in sanitary conditions (Raymond 2012), but nearly half of\nthe abortions done in the world are unsafe, according to the WHO definition.\n\nDespite\nits universality, abortion remains controversial and inaccessible for many\nwomen. Both the clinical and public health contexts of abortion are often\nexcluded from curricula in medicine, nursing, and other health professions. Restrictions\nat the hospital or clinic level, and conscientious objection at the provider\nlevel compounded with legal restrictions further reduce women’s access to\nservices. \n\nIn this six-week\ncourse, over twenty faculty from various institutions and multiple disciplines will place abortion within the context of\npublic health and fill in the gaps left by its exclusion from mainstream\ncurricula in health professions. Each week’s lectures will incorporate the\nstories of women who seek abortion in order to better portray abortion significance and rationale.  Other topics will include a brief\nhistory of abortion, the clinical aspects of medication and procedural\nabortions in and after the first trimester, an overview of patient-centered\nabortion-care, the basics of abortion counseling, the professional obligations\nof health care practitioners to ensure that women have access to safe abortion\ncare, and the maze of restrictions that make safe abortion care inaccessible to\nmany women.  \n\nIn addition to video lectures, there will be\nweekly quizzes, peer assessments, and optional additional content and reading\nfor learners who want to explore the topic further.  \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        WEEK 1: Abortion in the U.S. And Around the World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the public-health framework\nof this courseWho has abortions, why, and how do they\naccess careHistory of abortion and abortion stigma\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK 2: Abortion, Professionalism, and Patient-Centered Counseling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of pregnancy options counseling, abortion counseling,\nand informed consentAbortion in the United States after legalizationProfessional responsibilities around abortion careValues clarification about abortion careConscientious provision and refusal in abortion care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK 3: Abortion in the First Trimester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical aspects of medication abortion, aspiration abortion,\npost-abortion contraception, and pain management for abortionLegislative and policy obstacles to abortion access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK 4: Abortion after the First Trimester: Obstacles to Accessing Safe Abortion in the U.S. And Worldwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has abortions after the first trimester and how do they\naccess careClinical aspects of abortion after the first trimesterRole of patient preference in appropriate careGuidelines for safe abortion care and the principles of high-quality abortion care across settingsComplications and myths about abortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK 5: Overcoming Obstacles to Abortion\nAccess\n\nSociology of abortion especially related to health and\nhealth-care disparitiesImpact of obstacles on clinical careImportance of abortion training for health professionals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK 6: Early Pregnancy Loss and Course\nConclusions\n\nPatient-centered care for early pregnancy\nlossCounseling and decision making for early\npregnancy lossRelationship between early pregnancy loss\ncare and abortion careCourse conclusions\n                                    ",
