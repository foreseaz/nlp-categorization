We will examine contemporary and historic artists through lectures and interactive quizzes. With the use of a cell phone (you may also use a dslr or point-and-shoot), students learn to create, edit and critique images.\r\nMost of us now capture images using our cellphones. Cellphone technology has reached a point where the creativity has been put back in the hands of the photographer and is no longer a simple point-and-shoot process. In this course students will learn the fundamentals of composition, lighting, black and white, color, and more. We’ll look at the camera phone as a photographic tool and you’ll create a photo-based website to showcase your images and engage in peer critiques.\r\nCourse Objectives\r\n\r\nLearn or practice ability to shoot high quality digital still images\r\nLearn to use raster cell phone photo apps to edit, caption and retouch images\r\nLearn the basic vocabulary of contemporary photography and use it to discuss and critique work\r\nLearn to effectively communicate ideas emphasizing content, composition, and technique with digital photography\r\n\r\nTechnical Skills\r\nStudents are expected to find and operate the camera on their phone and download and open photo apps\n\n                                    ",
