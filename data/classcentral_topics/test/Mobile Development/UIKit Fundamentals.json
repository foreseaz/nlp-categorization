This framework constitutes the building blocks of the user interface for all iOS apps, and is crucial for any iOS Developer to be intimately familiar with.Why Take This Course?You’ve built your first iOS app. It was fun, but you might not be comfortable creating apps from scratch. After completing this course, you’ll have the skills you will need to create the UI elements for almost any app. During this course, you’ll learn everything you need to know about UIKit, from buttons to table views. To become fluent with UIKit requires practice, and this course will provide you with opportunities to create small working apps to build your skill set.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ###Lesson 1: Outlets and Actions\nIn this lesson, you’ll learn to connect outlets and actions using only code and graphically using storyboard. \n\nYou’ll use the following UIKit classes in this lesson:\n\n* UIButton\n* UILabel\n* UISwitch\n\n###Lesson 2: View Presentations and Segues\nIn this lesson, you’ll learn how to present views modally. \n\nWe will introduce you to the following UIKit classes:\n\n* UIImagePickerController\n* UIAlertController\n* UIActivityViewController\n\n###Lesson 3: The Delegate Pattern\nMany of the most common UIKit components make use of the delegate pattern. In this lesson, you’ll learn how delegates make important connections between the model, view, and controller.\n\nWe will introduce you to the following UIKit classes:\n\n* UITextField\n* UITextFieldDelegate\n\n###Lesson 4: Tables\nTable views are one of the most commonly used views in iOS apps. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to implement tables in your own apps. \n\nWe will introduce you to the following UIKit classes: \n\n* UITableView\n* UITableViewDelegate\n* UITableViewDataSource\n* UITableViewCell\n\n###Lesson 5: Navigation\nIn this lesson, you’ll learn how iOS uses navigation stacks to manage multiple views in an app. You’ll take UITableViews a step further and create the navigation structure that enables a user to tap a row of a table, view the details of an item, and return again. \n\nWe will introduce you to the following UIKit classes:\n\n* UINavigationController\n* UIBarButtonItem\n\n###Lesson 6: MemeMe Techniques\nThis lesson will guide you through the process of creating your own version of the meme generating app, MemeMe. You’ll learn about collection views, tab bar controllers, how to adjust the screen to accommodate the keyboard, and how to access the camera.\n\nWe will introduce you to the following UIKit classes:\n\n* UICollectionView\n* UICollectionViewDelegate\n* UICollectionViewDatasource\n* UITabBarController\n\nWe will also feature classes from the Foundation framework:\n\n* NSNotification\n* NSNotificationCenter\n                                    ",
