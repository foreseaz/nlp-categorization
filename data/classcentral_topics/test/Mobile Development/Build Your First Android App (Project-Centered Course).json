We’ll provide you with a set of customizable building blocks that you can assemble to create many different types of apps, and that will help you become familiar with many important specificities of Android development. When you complete the project, in addition to having a personalized app that you can use and share, you’ll have the skills and background you need to move on to more advanced coursework in Android development. \n\n What you’ll need to get started:\n\nThis project-centered course is designed for learners who have some prior experience programming in Java, such as an introductory college course or Coursera’s Java Programming Specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).\n\nYou will need a computer with a stable Internet connection, but you will not need an Android phone - we’ll use free software that you can use to emulate a phone on your computer. We'll use Android Studio as IDE; it is compatible with most computer and operating systems. You can find detailed system requirements here: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Requirements.\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share. \n\nTime: 10 hours of study, 10 hours of active project work\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        IntroductionThis module presents our pedagogic approach and demonstrates the kind of applications you will be able to build at the end of the course. We will truly jump into the course next week and you will start working on your project. So our advice is to get a head start and start looking at next week contents and peer-reviewed assignment as soon as you've reviewed this introductory module.Create the Storyboard for Your ApplicationIn this module you will design your personalized app from a user's perspective. We will show you elements you can combine in your design, and how to  document it to get feedback from prospective users or to organize your thoughts.If you get stuck on the quiz or peer-reviewed assignment, you should post on the Discussion Forum to ask for help. And if you finish early, we hope you'll go there to help your fellow classmates as well. To get started, please jump into the first lesson below!Install Tools, Create HelloWorld AppThis module guides you in the development of an Android application using the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). First it points you to the right place to install the Android Studio IDE and the Android Software Development Kit (SDK). Next it walks you through the steps of using them to create a basic \"Hello World\" application and it describes how to transfer the application for execution on a physical Android device and on an emulator. At the end of the module you will be familiar with Android tools.Build Your First Interactive ApplicationIn this module you associate for the first time a graphical user interface with an activity controlling it, resulting in a first interactive application. We will re-use this same schema next week when developing the 9 apps presented in week 2 (and so will your personalized app). Toward Your Application, Step-By-StepThis module spans 2 weeks. This week, we walk you step by step in the development of 5 of the basic building blocks.Transform Your Storyboard Into Actual ApplicationIn this second part of the module, we develop the remaining 4 basic building blocks. All you have to do after that is to combine them to transform your idea of application into executable code!\n                                    ",
