We will consider important software vulnerabilities and attacks that exploit them -- such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and session hijacking -- and we will consider defenses that prevent or mitigate these attacks, including advanced testing and program analysis techniques. Importantly, we take a \"build security in\" mentality, considering techniques at each phase of the development cycle that can be used to strengthen the security of software systems.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        OVERVIEWOverview and expectations of the courseLOW-LEVEL SECURITYLow-level security: Attacks and exploits\nDEFENDING AGAINST LOW-LEVEL EXPLOITSDefending against low-level exploitsWEB SECURITYWeb security: Attacks and defensesSECURE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTDesigning and Building Secure SoftwarePROGRAM ANALYSISStatic Program AnalysisPEN TESTINGPenetration and Fuzz Testing\n                                    ",
