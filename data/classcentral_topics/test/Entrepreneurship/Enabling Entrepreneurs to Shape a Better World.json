Tackling society’s big issues also requires new ways of thinking and above all an entrepreneurial approach.\r\n“Enabling Entrepreneurs to Shape a Better World” is all about developing a new mindset and learning to use field-tested tools and techniques for designing viable, impactful solutions for a better world - solutions that are – crucially – also based on self-sustaining business models.\r\nThis free, interactive course offers the chance to learn from some of the world’s top entrepreneurs and catalysts for social change. Featured speakers include Muhammad Yunus, Hedda Pahlson-Moller, Alexander Osterwalder, Cliff Prior, and Bill Liao. (You can read their biographies opposite).\r\nThe course is illustrated by a series of problem-based case studies on migration in China, Mexico, and Germany/Europe. These cases demonstrate how social action and business leadership can exert positive impact on some of the unique challenges posed by mass migration.\r\nIf you would like to dive deeper into the practice of impact-driven entrepreneurship, you will also have the option of joining an intensive special coaching track, where you will develop your ideas and work closely with an international team. On this optional special track, you will have the opportunity to participate in a competition, with a prize being awarded to the concept or project that shows the most potential for sustainable impact.\r\nAnd if you’re a student, you can obtain a certificate with credit points.\r\nSounds exciting?
