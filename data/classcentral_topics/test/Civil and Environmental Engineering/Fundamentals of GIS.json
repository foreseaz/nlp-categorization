In this class you will learn the basics of the industryâ€™s leading software tool, ArcGIS, during four week-long modules: \n\nWeek 1: Learn how GIS grew from paper maps to the globally integrated electronic software packages of today. You will install ArcGIS on your computer and learn how to use online help to answer technical questions.\n\nWeek 2: Open up ArcGIS and explore data using ArcMap. Learn the foundational concepts of GIS, how to analyze data, and make your first map.\n\nWeek 3: Make your own maps! Symbolize data and create an eye-catching final product. \n\nWeek 4: Share your data and maps and learn to store and organize your data.\n\nTake Fundamentals of GIS as a standalone course or as part of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialization. By completing the first class in the Specialization you will gain the skills needed to succeed in the full program.\n\nStudents who need an ArcGIS license will receive a non-commercial, 1 year student license for participation in this course and specialization.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course Introduction and Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS)In this module, we will cover cover course expectations, give you a quick overview of GIS and what's great about it, take a first look at ArcGIS and identify key elements in the interface, and define core geospatial concepts and terminology. In Section 2, we will discuss options for desktop GIS, the history of GIS and how it's used today, discuss resources and help that you can use, and lay out core skills that are relevant to you as a GIS analyst. We'll close out by showing you how to get a copy of ArcGIS for this course, and with a tutorial on getting started in ArcGIS.ArcGIS BasicsIn this module, we will explore GIS data using ArcMap and will explore and change properties of GIS layers to change map displays. We will subset data using selections, and explore feature attributes.  Finally, we will learn about projections and use that knowledge as we run geoprocessing tools.Making Maps With Common DatasetsIn this module we will identify common datasets in both the US and Internationally. We will use a new mode in ArcGIS to create complete maps that include proper symbology, legends, titles, north arrows, and data sources. We will further use more advanced mapping techniques to output map books and label items on the map.Retrieving and Sharing DataIn this module, we will view and edit metadata in order to create higher quality data. We will retrieve data from the web and share data, discuss workspaces and file formats, and create layer and map packages. We will also use multiple file formats for GIS data and be able to appropriately choose between them based upon project requirements.\n                                    ",
