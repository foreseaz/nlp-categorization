How many times have you heard of net profit, operating profit, operating margin, cash, earning and so on? But are they referring to the same concepts or are they different things?\r\nThe first part of this course will introduce the basic accounting principles and accounting terminology to understand how a company keeps control of financial events and provides information on how it is performing. These basic concepts will support the analysis of financial reports companies prepare. We will go through balance sheet, income statement, financial statement, learning how to read and analyze them.\r\nThe course will also provide the basis of management accounting introducing some techniques (e.g. break- even analysis or NPV) to support managers in making short-term and long-term decisions, such as \"Is it convenient to dispose a production machine and buy a new one?\" or \"How many products should the company sell in order to break-even?\"\r\nThe course will bring examples and case studies that will help students better understand the practical applications of the basic accounting principles and techniques. At the end of the course, students will be able to read, understand and analyze financial documents and to apply simple techniques to analyse costs and evaluate capital investment decisions.\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nNo prerequisite knowledge is required. It is particularly recommended for students with little background in financial and managerial accounting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n                                    ",
