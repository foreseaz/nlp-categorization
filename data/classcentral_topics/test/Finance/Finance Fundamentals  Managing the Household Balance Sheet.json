We get to grips with the factors that drive interest levels. We look at the differences between ‘good’ debts and ‘bad’ debts and at the way lenders credit score those seeking to borrow money.\n\nWe then move on to examine the array of investments that people can hold – including savings accounts, bonds, shares and holdings in funds. We look at the determinants of investment returns and at the historical evidence about which are the best investments. We also look at how investments are taxed.\n\nHousing is the next topic. We look at the costs of buying and selling property and at the rationale for owning property and the risks involved. This involves understanding the mortgage products that are used to buy property.\n\nThe course finishes at examining one very crucial investment: the investment in our pension fund to support use in retirement. We examine how occupational or personal pensions are needed to top up the pension provided by the state and at how to determine how much income you will need in retirement. We also look at the impact of the recent reforms to pensions in the UK.\n\nThe facilitated 4-week course is up-to-date and uses an array of audio-visual assets to help you through the subject matter.\n\nDevelop fundamental business and finance skills\n\nThis course has been developed by The Open University Business School – a pioneering institution that is triple accredited by AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB.\n\nIt is one of eight from The Open University, designed to help you gain fundamental business and financial skills, including communication, networking, relationship building, project management, personal financial planning and management, investment and financial services.\n\nYou can complete this course as part of one of these two programs:\n\nFinance Fundamentals: four courses, which will give you valuable skills to manage finances at home and at work, and enable you to earn a FutureLearn Award.\n\nBusiness and Finance Fundamentals: eight courses; holders of FutureLearn Certificates of Achievement for all eight courses can earn 30 UK credits towards The Open University Business School’s BA in Business Management by passing a linked Open University assessment module (requiring separate OU registration and fee).\n\nFor further information about registration, the final assessment course and the BA in Business Management, visit the Open University website.\n\nThe True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance (True Potential PUFin)\n\nThis course has been adapted from original material created by The Open University’s True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance, and was made possible thanks to the generous support of True Potential LLP.\n\n\n                                    ",
