Learners will be exposed to a number of important theoretical frameworks to analyze how financial policies can create value for a firm in a world with “frictions” such as bankruptcy costs, taxation policy, information problems, and conflict of interests between different stakeholders. Specifically, the course covers topics such as debt and equity management, their relative attractiveness under different tax rules, and how these instruments can be used to alleviate the effects of informational and agency frictions. The course relates all concepts to real world examples such as capital structure choices, bankruptcy decisions, and leveraged buyouts. Learners are presented with a number of opportunities to think critically about real-world financial decisions in the context of the framework they are exposed to.\n\nThis course is targeted to managers working in corporations or institutions and individuals planning to pursue a graduate degree in business (MBA).\n\nThis course is a natural follow-up to “Financial Markets and Institutions” and part of the Corporate Financial Analysis X-Series.\n\n                                    ",
