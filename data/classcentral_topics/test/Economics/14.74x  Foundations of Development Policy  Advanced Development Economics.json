While studying each of these topics, we will delve into the following questions:\n\nWhat determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries?\n\tWhat constraints are poor households subject to?\n\tWhat is the scope for policy interventions (implemented by the government, international organizations, or NGOs)?\n\tWhat policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?\nAt the same time, you will discover modern empirical methods in economics, in particular Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Throughout the course, we will expose you to all facets of empirical projects, from experimental design and ethical issues, to data collection and data analysis.You will have the chance to gain experience working with real data using software for statistical analysis during weekly assignments.\n\n                                    ",
