Students will explore game theory, the structure of the Internet, social contagion, the spread of social power and popularity, and information cascades.\n\nThis MOOC is based on an interdisciplinary Cornell University course entitled Networks, taught by professors David Easley, Jon Kleinberg, and Ã‰va Tardos. That course was also the basis for the book, Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. This course is designed at the introductory undergraduate level without formal prerequisites.\n\n                                    ",
