In 6 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies, that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. The course often uses US and European examples, but does not focus on policies from any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries of the world.\nIt touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n\nClimate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\nTechnology as the engine of economic growth;\nTaxing the Rich. How to Mitigate the Growing Inequality Problem? Should we   impose a Global Tax on Capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from Chicago and NYU. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\nWhat is the Goal of the State?; Why do we need a State to achieve this Goal?\nWeek 2:\nThe engine of Economic Growth; The relationship between Efficiency and Equality.\nWeek 3:\nChoosing the laws that would maximize Social Welfare (Happiness).   \nWeek 4:\nMeasuring and Defining Inequality, Poverty and Social Efficiency.\nWeek 5:\nWho Bears the Economic Burden of Tax; Understanding Progressivity.\nWeek 6:\nDesigning the Optimal Tax and Transfer System. \n \n                                    ",
