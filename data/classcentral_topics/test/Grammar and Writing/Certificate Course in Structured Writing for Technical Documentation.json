Documents are no longer written and published as individual entities within a documentation set but rather written as data segments for reuse on systems that automate processes for controlling and managing the segments. Information is no longer published as a document solely for paper ouput, but for electronic access on PCs, cell phones, and other handheld devices. This means that the technical writer today must be familiar with the solutions that employ the features of structured writing for reuse, and the latest standard approaches for segmenting and storing information for output to multiple types of formats and access on different devices.\r\nThe course is designed to further your technical writing skills with use of XMetaL, XML, and the DITA standard. It also introduces you to other writing standards, output options, and content management systems. Basic knowledge of writing standards, output options, and content management systems is helpful.\n\n                                    ",
