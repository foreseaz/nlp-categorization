Stat2x is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics, the science of drawing conclusions from data.\n\nThe course is the online equivalent of Statistics 2, a 15-week introductory course taken in Berkeley by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2x is divided into three 5-week components. Stat2.1x is the first of the three.\n\nThe focus of Stat2.1x is on descriptive statistics. The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities.\n\nThere will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout Stat2.1x, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the format of the class?\n\tInstruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.\n\t\n\tHow much does it cost to take the course?\n\tNothing! The course is free.\n\t\n\tWill the text of the lectures be available?\n\tYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\n\t\n\tDo I need to watch the lectures live?\n\tNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.\n\t\n\tCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\n\tYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.\n\t\n\tDo I need any other materials to take the course?\n\tIf you have any questions about edX generally, please see the edXÂ FAQ.\n\t\n\n\n                                    ",
