This course will help coaches, players, and enthusiasts to make educated decisions about strategy, training, and execution. We will discuss topics such as the myth of the Hot Hand and the curse of the Sports Illustrated cover; how understanding data can improve athletic performance; and how best to pick your Fantasy Football team. We will also see how elementary Calculus provides insight into the biomechanics of sports and how game theory can help improve an athlete’s strategy on the field.\n \nIn this course you will learn:\n\nHow a basic understanding of probability and statistics can be used to analyze sports and other real life situations.\n\tHow to model physical systems, such as a golf swing or a high jump, using basic equations of motion.\n\tHow to best pick your Fantasy Football, March Madness, and World Cup winners by using ranking theory to help you determine athletic and team performance. \nBy the end of the course, you will have a better understanding of math, how math is used in the sports we love, and in our everyday lives. \n\n                                    ",
