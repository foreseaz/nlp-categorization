Specific topics include:\r\n1. Describing data (types of data, data visualization, descriptive statistics)2. Statistical inference (probability, probability distributions, sampling theory, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, pitfalls of p-values)3. Specific statistical tests (ttest, ANOVA, linear correlation, non-parametric tests, relative risks, Chi-square test, exact tests, linear regression, logistic regression, survival analysis; how to choose the right statistical test)\r\nThe course focuses on real examples from the medical literature and popular press. Each week starts with \"teasers,\" such as: Should I be worried about lead in lipstick? Should I play the lottery when the jackpot reaches half-a-billion dollars? Does eating red meat increase my risk of being in a traffic accident? We will work our way back from the news coverage to the original study and then to the underlying data. In the process, participants will learn how to read, interpret, and critically evaluate the statistics in medical studies.\r\nThe course also prepares participants to be able to analyze their own data, guiding them on how to choose the correct statistical test and how to avoid common statistical pitfalls. Optional modules cover advanced math topics and basic data analysis in R.\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\r\nParticipants will need to be familiar with a few basic math tools: summation sign, factorial, natural log, exponential, and the equation of a line; a brief tutorial is available on the course website for participants who need a refresher on these topics.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nWeek 1 - Descriptive statistics and looking at dataWeek 2 - Review of study designs; measures of disease risk and associationWeek 3 - Probability, Bayes' Rule, Diagnostic TestingWeek 4 - Probability distributionsWeek 5 - Statistical inference (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing)Week 6 - P-value pitfalls; types I and type II error; statistical power; overview of statistical testsWeek 7 - Tests for comparing groups (unadjusted); introduction to survival analysisWeek 8 - Regression analysis; linear correlation and regressionWeek 9 - Logistic regression and Cox regression\r\n \r\n\n                                    ",
