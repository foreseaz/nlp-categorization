To cope effectively, every informed citizen must be statistically literate.  This course will provide an intuitive introduction to applied statistical reasoning,  introducing fundamental statistical skills and acquainting students with the full process of inquiry and evaluation used in investigations in a wide range of fields.  In particular, the course will cover methods of data collection, constructing effective graphical and numerical displays to understand the data, how to estimate and describe the error in estimates of some important quantities, and the key ideas in how statistical tests can be used to separate significant differences from those that are only a reflection of the natural variability in data.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        A first look at data\nWeeks 1-2: Summary statistics and graphical displays for a single categorical or quantitative variable and for relationships between two variables.\nCollecting data\nWeek 2:  Sampling.  Observational studies and experiments.  The effect of confounding and concluding causation.\nProbability\nWeek 3:  Probability models, the normal distribution, the Law of Large Numbers, the Central Limit Theorem, sampling distributions.\nConfidence Intervals Week 4: Confidence intervals and sample size estimation for proportions and means.\nTests of significance Week 5: Tests of significance, power and sample size estimation for proportions and meansTwo samplesWeek 6: Tests of significance and confidence intervals for proportions and means in the two sample case.\nSimple linear regression\nWeek 7: Method of least squares, evaluating model fit, the effects of outliers and influential observations.\nThe process of statistical inquiry\nWeek 8: Capstone case study.\n                                    ",
