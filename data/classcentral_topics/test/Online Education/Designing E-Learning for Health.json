We all have a stake in it, so it is vital that both professionals and patients not only have access to accurate information, but also to the stories and experiences of real people.\n\nTranslate real-life experiences into effective e-learning\n\nAs educators, we know that bringing these voices to life in e-learning will make it more effective, but this also poses challenges:\n\n\n  How do we translate real-life experiences into e-learning?\n  How can our e-learning tell powerful stories?\n  What methods can we use to design high quality and reusable e-learning resources?\n  And how can we best get our concepts and ideas across to multiple audiences?\n\n\nDiscover a methodology for designing e-learning objects\n\nIn this free online course, we will explore these questions and introduce a methodology that you can use yourself, to design your own e-learning objects in all sorts of contexts, not just health. We will take you through the process – from deciding on a learning aim to getting ready to develop your resource.\n\nBy the end of the five weeks, you will have created your own storyboard and specification for a high quality piece of e-learning, which you can then develop further after the course.\n\nLearn with the Health E-Learning and Media (HELM) team\n\nThe course is led by The University of Nottingham’s Health E-Learning and Media team (HELM). We will deliver our course as a team, and encourage collaboration and discussion, so that we can all learn from each other.\n\nHELM has developed over 200 standalone and free-to-use Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) over the last 15 years, which have been used by an estimated one million people from 50 countries for teaching or self-directed learning.\n\nWe will be sharing our flexible and practical methodology, which works for us and many others.\n\nSo, whatever your background – whether you are working in, or are a user of, education, health or training; have an interest in e-learning and online pedagogies; or simply want to learn more about how to get ideas out there – we look forward to meeting you.\n\n\n                                    ",
