These virtual spaces are not all equal and constantly evolving design and functionality, one of the key aspects is the quality of the dialogue being promoted to facilitate learning. That is why, currently there are countless ways to develop them taking into account dynamic interrelationships between the content, the role of educators and students, learning and interaction that favor the educational process.\n\n                                    ",
