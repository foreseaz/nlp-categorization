Driving the implementation of social media policy is a great way for Human Resources (HR) and business leaders to demonstrate value with executive leadership.\r\n\r\nThis course addresses the first part of policy development: what is the policy need? It begins by identifying uses of social media in the workplace. Then it addresses four areas that present risk to an organization. By the time you are done, you will have an idea where your biggest gaps are that require further exploration and policy development. You will be able to answer these questions: How does my organization use or desire to use social media? What risks exist that require social media policy?\n\n                                    ",
