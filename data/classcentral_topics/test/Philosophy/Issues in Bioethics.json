To understand and appreciate them we need to adopt an interdisciplinary approach where biological, medical, philosophical and sociological aspects have to be considered. In actual contexts practitioners often have to negotiate with a number of issues which have cultural and religious implications and they may have to communicate these implications to patients who belong to different social backgrounds. This course addresses some of such issues and explores the ways in tackling them\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1st week: Introduction to bioethics and its importance &amp; an Historical evolution of bioethics\r\n2nd week: Important theoretical frameworks\r\n3rd week: Global and Local Challenges to Bioethics\r\n4th week: Issues Related to Individual and Social Justice\n                                    ",
