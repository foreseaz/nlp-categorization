Use this result to prove Gödel’s famous Incompleteness Theorem.\nBonus: If you sign up to pursue a Verified Certificate for this class, you will be assigned problems that are graded by teaching assistants, and given professional written feedback. This will bring your learning experience one level closer to that of residential students at MIT. If you pass the class, you will receive an MITx certificate, in addition to edX's Verified Certificate of Achievement.\n\n                                    ",
