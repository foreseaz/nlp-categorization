The demands of the new workplace and the ready access to information afforded by new technologies have radically changed the way we define a scientifically literate society. More than ever teachers need professional development that provides them with the resources they need and empowers them to take the action required to build classrooms where the next generation of scientifically literate students will flourish. Inquiry Science Learning: Perspectives and Practices consists of four courses, each designed to address a different strand in the development of skills teachers need to meet the demands of their career, including the following.Science LeadershipTechniques for SuccessScience ContentStudent-Centered InquiryIn this third course we will focus on helping teachers explore their own and their students misconceptions over a broad array of topics within science and engineering.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        The specific content explored by each participant will be determined by the needs and interests of that participant.
