However, many writing instructors at other educational institutions have not had significant training in teaching students with learning disabilities.\r\nThis short program of study will explore strategies to help students with learning disabilities become more comfortable with the writing process in the classroom environment. While the course is aimed to help instructors of writing better accommodate their students, parents of students with learning disabilities, as well as the students themselves, may find this course useful.\r\nTogether, we will explore:\r\n\r\nTypes of learning disabilities that make writing difficult\r\nEffective classroom practices\r\nIndividual student conferencing strategies\r\nAssistive technology\r\n\r\nJoin us for a rich and much-needed discussion on how to help our students with learning disabilities succeed in writing.\r\nIntended Audience: Educators\r\nTime to complete the course: About two hours a week\r\nCertificate or digital badge for completing the course: Certificate of Completion\r\nFormat: Instructor-led\r\nAsynchronous (independent) activities: Yes\r\nSynchronous (class) activities: No\r\nInstructor feedback: Via responses in discussion forum\r\nPeer feedback: Via responses in discussion forum\r\nGroup work: No\r\nPrerequisites: None\n\n                                    ",
