The course will cover:\r\n\r\nThe basics of flipped/hybrid/MOOC methods\r\nWhat is known and not known in the literature\r\nWhere these learning methods are heading\r\nHow to develop content for online (video) and for active, in-class learning\r\nWays to think about and organize your course\r\nHow to assess both students and your teaching\r\n\r\nThe course is taught flipped/MOOC-style by veteran flippers and MOOCers to give you experience with the tools and learning methods that can help your students succeed in this type of learning environment. Plan to watch/read about an hour of material each week and then try out and share what you have found. By the end of the course you should have a good idea of how to flip your own course, and have the tools to do it well.\n\n                                    ",
