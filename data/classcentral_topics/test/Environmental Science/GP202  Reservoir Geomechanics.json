The first part of the course establishes the basic principles involved in a way that allows readers from different disciplinary backgrounds to understand the key concepts.\r\nThe course is intended for geoscientists and engineers in the petroleum and geothermal industries, and for research scientists interested in stress measurements and their application to problems of faulting and fluid flow in the crust.\r\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND:\r\nIntroductory Geology and GeophysicsFamiliarity with principles of drilling and petroleum production\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n20, 90 minute lectures (in ~20 minute segments). 2 lectures will be made available each week, starting April 1, 2014.\r\nLecture 1 is a course overview to introduce students to the topics covered in the course. Lectures 2-17 follow 12 chapters of Dr. Zobackâ€™s textbook, Reservoir Geomechanics (Cambridge University Press, 2007) with updated examples and applications. Lectures 18 and 19 are on topics related to geomechanical issues affecting shale gas and tight oil recovery. Lecture 20 is on the topic of managing the risk of triggered and induced seismicity.\r\n8 Homework assignments (and associated video modules) are intended to give students hands-on experience with a number of the topics addressed in the course.\r\nThe course grade will be based solely on homework assignments. There will be no quizzes or exams.\r\nHomework assignments will be graded electronically and will consist of multiple choice and numerical entry responses.\r\nThere will be an online discussion forum where students can discuss the content of the course and ask questions of each other and the instructors.\r\n\n                                    ",
