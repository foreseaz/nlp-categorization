We will answer the questions -what are organisations and policy makers doing to secure our water future? How is society working together towards climate resilience?\r\nWe’ll look at examples from around the world, learn about a vast range of technologies like desalination, and you’ll understand what’s involved in sustainable thinking and decision making. We’ll also explore the world of wastewater, and how its treatment is vital to the protection of health and the environment; and how wastewater can be recycled into pure drinking water\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nYou will learn about climate change and urbanisation and its impact on the water cycle\r\nWhat climate change means for people and the environment in terms of water, and what the world is doing about it\r\nWhat Renewable Energy means for the Water Cycle as a solution to Climate Change\r\nHow water and wastewater is piped and treated; and how to manage treated wastewater\r\nHow to be climate resilient by using seawater and wastewater as new water sources\r\nWhat can be done to save drying dams\r\nYou will learn the following using the successes and failures of case studies from North America, Australia, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East:\r\n\r\nHow to plan for water and wastewater infrastructure\r\nWhat’s involved in sustainable thinking and decision making\r\nThe World Water Agenda, and how countries are meeting or falling short on their targets\r\nWhy Stakeholder and Community Engagement is so vital to water goals\r\nThe importance of sustainable Catchment Management, and what can happen if we cannot diversify the water supply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nPlanning engineer\r\nScientist\r\nPolicy advisor\r\nProject manager\r\nSafety coordinator\r\nEcologist\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 1: SHOULD WE GO WITH THE FLOW ON THIS ONE?\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 2: CLEVER FOREVER: WATER PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE THINKING\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 3: MULTIPLY THE SUPPLY: DEVELOPING NEW WATER SOURCES\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE 4: MANAGE WATER LIKE A BOSS: GLOBAL APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ",
