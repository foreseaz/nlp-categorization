However, in the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists concluding humans are causing global warming.\n\nWhy the gap between the public and scientists?\n\tWhat are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the scientific consensus?\n\tHow has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change?\nThis course examines the science of climate science denial.\n\nWe will look at the most common climate myths from “global warming stopped in 1998” to “global warming is caused by the sun” to “climate impacts are nothing to worry about.”\n\nWe’ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You’ll learn both the science of climate change and the techniques used to distort the science.\n\nWith every myth we debunk, you’ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge, you’ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.\n\nThis isn’t just a climate MOOC; it’s a MOOC about how people think about climate change.\n\n                                    ",
