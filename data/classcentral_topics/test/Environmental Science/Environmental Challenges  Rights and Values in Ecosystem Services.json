A discussion explores ecosystem services.\n\nThis course will help you to understand these basic principles so that you are equipped to help deal with some of the difficult environmental decisions we are facing.\n\nHumans are very innovative, but we’ve also created many ecological problems. We’ve changed the face of the planet by agriculture and forestry. We’ve fished the oceans, and we’re causing climate change through greenhouse gases released from fossil fuels.\n\nDesigning institutional arrangements that recognise ecosystem services in the values we place upon natural systems will be an important way to help governing the planet, for both present and future generations.\n\nIntrigued?

When you complete all five courses in the program and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will be eligible to join a final assessment course that leads to the award of 10 credits from the University of Leeds.\n\nGain a key environmental management skill\n\nEach course in the program includes an exercise and revision material to help you develop a skill that is key to working in environmental management – this course explores how to write a press release.\n\nChoose how you would like to learn\n\n\n  \n    If you have a general interest in this topic, you can work through the activities in around three hours each week. You will have the opportunity to check your understanding and spend some time joining the discussions.\n  \n  \n    If you would like to know more about the topic, you can spend up to an extra two hours a week reading the additional materials and watching the videos provided in the ‘Downloads’ and ‘See also’ sections within some course steps. By doing this, you will have the required knowledge to attempt the end of course test.\n  \n  \n    If you have more time to study, you can also complete the optional revision activity and join a live Q&amp;A session in the second week of the course – this will help you when you attempt the end of course test. You will need to allow a further two hours a week to cover the revision tasks.\n  \n\n\n\n                                    ",
