The course features Vancouver, one of the world's leading cities for green design.\n\nEach week, you’ll watch lectures plus a compelling documentary-style video featuring architects, planners, artists, engineers, and academics that have created real-world innovations which link water and sustainability in the built environment. You’ll meet the inspiring founder of the Center for Interactive Research on Sustainability (one of the greenest buildings in North America); visit North America’s largest urban wastewater-to-energy plant; learn from architects designing urban waterscapes as ‘landscape infrastructure’ along Vancouver’s revitalized waterfront; travel along one of North America’s largest revitalized urban streams, which has become a hub for community engagement; and explore the creation of a ‘watershed mind’ with an award-winning poet and artist. \n\n                                    ",
