You will also learn how scientists from countries around the North are working together to understand how these changes will affect the People of the North and the global community. You will experience a range of scientific topics, up-to-date-methods for understanding our environment, and the current consensus views on the future of the Arctic environment.\n\nDo I need prior knowledge?\nNo prior knowledge is needed for this course; participants should only come equipped with natural curiosity and a willingness to invest time in understanding an environmental issue of global concern. The terms and concepts are targeted at an educated public, not specialists, but resources will be provided so those who are motivated can explore some issues in more depth.  \n\nDo I get a certificate?\nStudents showing evidence of participating in this course can earn an official Statement of Participation which will be a “Certificate of Knowledge on Changing Arctic Landscapes” jointly awarded by TSU, INTERACT and the University of the Arctic. \nRequirements for receiving this Certificate are to show evidence of participating in the quizzes and in the final exam.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to the СourseThis module represents the course content and its author as well as contains the additional materials to the courseWhat is the Arctic, where is it and why should we be interested in it?This module will introduce the INTERACT basis of the course and brief description as well as give different definitions of the Arctic, characteristics of the Arctic, peoples of the Arctic, Ecosystem Services and global connections.Changing landforms: the legacy of glaciers and permafrostIn this module we will talk about glacial erosion, moraines, ice dams and tsunamis.Permafrost and its effects In this module you will learn about permafrost characteristics, changes and effects on landscapes, hydrology and infrastructure.Snow and ice This module will introduce changing snow conditions, snow as an insulator, pollutants in snow, life in snow, melting ice, glacier dynamics and effects.Land-atmosphere linkages This module represents examples of biogeochemical and biogeophysical feedbacks to climate and what a feedback is. In this module we discuss carbon dioxide, methane, volatile organic compounds, albedo, energy exchange.Life on cold lands This module is dedicated to the arctic life zone, arctic plants and animals, population cycles, species interactions, the “greening” of the Arctic.Life in cold waters In this module we will talk about high latitude lakes as indicators of environmental change past and present, changes in lake ice; the importance of water colour; wet surfaces and microbes, water plants and animals.The People of the ArcticIn this module you will learn about  what changes in the Arctic mean do for the People of the Arctic and how they can work with scientists.The global Community affected by the changing ArcticThis module is dedicated to challenges and opportunities of Arctic change; winners and losers; widening inequalities. What can we do to understand the changes and their consequences?In this module you will learn about INTERACT’s role in arctic collaboration, global and region initiatives, public involvement. \n                                    ",
