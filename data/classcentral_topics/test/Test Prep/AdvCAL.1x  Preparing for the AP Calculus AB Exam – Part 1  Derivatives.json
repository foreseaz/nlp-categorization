This course is Part 1 of our XSeries: AP Calculus AB and it is designed to prepare you for the AP exam.\n\nIn Part 1, you will be learning about limits and derivatives. Limits are an integral part of calculus and many important ideas, definitions, formulas and theorems in calculus are derived from a limit. Derivatives are used to describe the rate of change of one variable with respect to another variable, allowing you to understand change in a variety of contexts. You will be learning to apply derivatives to real-world applications such as related rates, optimization, and growth/decay models.\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP calculus teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems. By the end of the course, you should be ready to take on the AP exam!\n\n                                    ",
