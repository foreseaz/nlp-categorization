At the completion of this course, you will be able to identify tradeoffs and make decisions for designing public and hybrid cloud solutions.\n\nThis course will help you prepare for the Microsoft Certification Exam 70-534: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions.\n\nNote: To complete the final assignment in this course, you will need an Azure subscription. You can use your existing Azure account, or sign up for a free Azure trial subscription (a valid credit card is required for verification, but you will not be charged for Azure services). Note that the free trial is not available in all regions. It is possible to complete the course and earn a certificate without completing the final assignment.\n\n                                    ",
