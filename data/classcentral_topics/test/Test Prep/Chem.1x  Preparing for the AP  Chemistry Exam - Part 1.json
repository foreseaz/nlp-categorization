It includes modern atomic theory, periodic table and trends, stoichiometry, bonding, molecular structure, kinetics, thermodynamics, equilibrium, acids and bases, gases, liquids and solids, electrochemistry and solubility. The material which includes video lectures, practice questions and review exams may be used for self-study by students and teachers. This is a self-paced, asynchronous course. The course material will be released on a weekly basis. It is meant to be a great resource without heavy staff support or involvement. This means that students can proceed through the material at a pace that suits their personal schedule. While students are welcome to interact with fellow students on the discussion boards, there are no opportunities to interact with the course staff directly.\n\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\nThis course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.\n\n* Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\n                                    ",
