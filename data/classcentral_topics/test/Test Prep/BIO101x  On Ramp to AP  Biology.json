This is the course for you!\n\nThis short course will briefly review basic concepts covered in AP Biology, and will include advanced challenge questions. Starting with a review of genetics and related content, the course will prepare you to tackle Investigation 2 and 3 of the AP Biology curriculum. You will learn how to create a mathematical model of populations and be able to compare DNA and Protein sequences using BLAST. The students who complete this mini-course will be better prepared to tackle more advanced course material in the future.\n\nFAQ\n\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\n\nGenerally, no. Having access to an introductory-level biology textbook would be useful; However, the course will refer you to various free online resources if you need more review of a particular concept.\n\nWill this course prepare me for the AP Biology Exam?\n\nNo. The purpose of the course is to help you achieve success in the AP Biology course that you will be taking subsequently.\n\nDoes it cost anything to take this course?\n\nNo. The course is completely free.
