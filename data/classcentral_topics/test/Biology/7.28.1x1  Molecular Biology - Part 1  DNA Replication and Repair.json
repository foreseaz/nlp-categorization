How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?\n \nAre you ready to go beyond the “what\" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?\n \nTake a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them? We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.\n \nLet’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the replication machinery and pathways that protect the fidelity of DNA synthesis. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28x Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair.\n \nFollow the latest news from MITx Biology @MITxBio on Twitter.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho can register for this course?\n\n\tUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. \n\t\tWhile edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. \n\t\tSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. \n\t\tWe are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\t\n\n\n                                    ",
