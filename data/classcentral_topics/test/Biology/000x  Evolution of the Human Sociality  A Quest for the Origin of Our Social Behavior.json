How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments.\n\nIn primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable.\n\nThis course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan. Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates.\n\nWe will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes.\n\nOur goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives.\n\nNo previous academic knowledge is required. Join us and evolve together with “Evolution of the Human Sociality.”\n\n                                    ",
