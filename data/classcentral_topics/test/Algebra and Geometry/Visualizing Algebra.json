Have you ever wondered how many songs can fit onto your flash drive? By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have stronger skills for modeling problems, analyzing patterns, and using algebra to arrive at conclusions.Why Take This Course?Understand and develop the language, models, and tools for math reasoning.\n\n\nReason with numbers and units to solve problems.\n\n\nIdentify, analyze, extend, and create patterns and functions.\n\n\nMake connections about relations and functions through multiple representations: graphs, charts, tables, equations.\n\n\nApply mathematical reasoning and logic to solve equations and write equivalent forms.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1 - Review of Foundations \n\nUnit 2 - Equations and Inequalities \n\nUnit 3 - Graphs of Linear Equations \n\nUnit 4 - Systems of Equations \n\nUnit 5 - Exponents and Polynomials \n\nUnit 6 - Factoring \n\nUnit 7 - Rational Expressions \n\nUnit 8 - Rational Exponents and Radicals \n\nUnit 9 - Solving Quadratic Equations \n\nUnit 10 - Quadratic Equations and Applications \n\nUnit 11 - Conic Sections \n\nUnit 12 - Inverses, Exponentials, and Logarithms\n                                    ",
