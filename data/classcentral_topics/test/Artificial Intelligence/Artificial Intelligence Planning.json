Pick one from below:\n                                                                    aiplan-001\n                                                                    aiplan-002\n                                                                    aiplan-003\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    The January to March 2015 session was the final version of the \ncourse, but it remains open until March 2016 so that those interested \ncan register and access all the materials. All assignments are available\n to try but will not score or be eligible for a statement of \naccomplishment. Soon after that date Coursera will no longer support the\n platform on which this course is built, but the course materials and videos will continue to be available via:    http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/plan/ooc/ (AI Planning Course Home Page)    http://bit.ly/aiplanmooc (Videos on YouTube)The course aims to provide a foundation in artificial intelligence techniques for planning, with an overview of the wide spectrum of different problems and approaches, including their underlying theory and their applications. It will allow you to:\n\nUnderstand different planning problems\nHave the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems\nKnow how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains\nHave the ability to make use of AI planning literature\n\nPlanning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction and Planning in Context\nWeek 2: State-Space Search: Heuristic Search and STRIPSWeek 3: Plan-Space Search and HTN Planning\nOne week catch up break\nWeek 4: Graphplan and Advanced Heuristics\nWeek 5: Plan Execution and Applications\nExam week\n                                    ",
