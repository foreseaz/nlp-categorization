If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Welcome! The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on \nCoursera, while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the \ntechnical illustrations. We \nhope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more students in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides \nwill not require advanced English ability to understand, though. If you \ncan understand the following descriptions of this course, you can \nprobably follow the slides. [歡迎大家！這門課將採用英文投影片配合華文的教學講解，我們希望能藉這次華文教學的機會，將機器學習介紹給更多華人世界的同學們。課程中使用的英文投影片不會使用到艱深的英文，如果你能了解以下兩段的課程簡介，你應該也可以了解課程所使用的英文投影片。]In the prequel of this course, Machine Learning Foundations, we have illustrated the necessary fundamentals that give any student of machine learning a \nsolid foundation to explore further techniques. While many new techniques are being designed every day, some techniques stood the test of time and became popular tools nowadays. The course roughly corresponds to the second \nhalf-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine \nLearning.\" Based \non five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including \nwinning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan \nUniversity) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the \ninstructor chooses to focus on three of those popular tools, namely embedding numerous features (kernel models, such as support vector machine), combining predictive features (aggregation models, such as adaptive boosting), and distilling hidden features (extraction models, such as deep learning). \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Each of the following items correspond to approximately one hour of video lecture.
