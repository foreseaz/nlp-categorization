You will see what this disciplined way of working with colleagues can look and feel like in a school setting. You will also have the opportunity to share insights and experiences about school improvement with educators from around the world.\n \nIn this course, you will:\n\nUnderstand what the Data Wise Improvement Process is and how it can help you improve teaching and learning.\n\tBuild skills in looking at a wide range of data sources, including test scores, student work, and teaching practice.\n\tIdentify next steps in supporting a culture of collaborative data inquiry in your setting.\nIntroduction to Data Wise is open to all, but is especially valuable for teachers and school and district leaders, as well as policymakers, and educational entrepreneurs who are dedicated to improving outcomes for students. There are several ways you could take this course-\n\nParticipate on your own.\n\tEnroll with a few colleagues as part of a study group.\n\tFormally integrate it into professional development in your workplace.\nIt is a self-paced course. You can go through the essential materials in a day or take several weeks to allow for reflection. There will be one month of active course facilitation, which will include discussion board moderation, office hours, and other live events.\n \nThis course provides an introduction to a rich portfolio of books, resources, training, and support developed by the Data Wise Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The Data Wise Project works in partnership with teachers and school and system leaders to develop and field-test resources that support collaborative school improvement. We encourage you to explore these resources as you chart a course for using data to improve learning and teaching for all students.\n \n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.
