This education and teacher training course explores the 5E instructional model and its uses in the classroom. You will have the opportunity to learn from videos of classroom teachers modeling a 5E lesson and access teacher commentary as they use inquiry-based strategies with their students. As a result, you will develop the skills and strategies needed to implement inquiry-based instruction in your own classroom.\n\nAn inquiry-based approach honors the complex work of learning. It prioritizes the knowledge and experience that students bring to the classroom and it promotes active problem solving, communication, and the shared construction of new ideas. Inquiry-based instruction is the foundation for the UTeach model. This education course serves as a useful introduction to this approach.\n\nYou will have from June 1 through August 17 to complete the five-week course in a way that fits your schedule. You may also want to consider the self-paced version of Classroom Strategies for Inquiry-Based Learning that launches August 18th and runs through May 31, 2017.\n\n                                    ",
