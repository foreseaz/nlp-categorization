We will specifically focus on topics of interaction of the simulation models with the real world using Arduino Microcontrollers and Simulink®'s corresponding Arduino Support Package.First, we will explain modelling and simulation concepts in general and introduce Simulink®. As a first application, we show how a simplified model of a Water Treatment Plant is implemented using Simulink®. We will then use an Arduino microcontroller to access hardware in the real world. We will go on to introduce control engineering techniques using Simulink® and apply these techniques to drive an example system of a ball floating in an airstream.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 1: My first Simulink® modelChapter 2: Advanced Simulink® modellingChapter 3: Modelling a Water Treatment PlantChapter 4: The Arduino microcontroller and the corresponding Simulink® support packageChapter 5: Control Engineering using Simulink®Chapter 6: Control Engineering using the Arduino\n                                    ",
