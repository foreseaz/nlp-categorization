We will trace the development of architecture since the early 90s by discussing the work of some of the most influential architects of our time. The critical reflection on contemporary topics will allow students to better understand the buildings and cities which we live in. When talking about the architectural protagonists of today, we will focus on their most recent work. Some references will be made to their earlier work, but the focus will be on how they adapt their thinking to current design tendencies. We will examine the evolution of their work and at the same time try to understand how they react to current challenges and opportunities in our profession and society.\r\nExercises and Assignments\r\nStudents will do research and critical analysis of architecture. They will analyze and comment on the projects presented in each chapter of the course. They will also explore buildings in the cities where they live and visit, according to the concepts introduced in the course, by taking pictures and making videos. The work will be posted every week on the course forum and discussed with others. A selection of the best projects and posts will be featured in an exhibit after completing the course.\r\nWhat will you learn?\r\nThe course will introduce participants to the contemporary architecture scene and allow them to position themselves into it. Students will acquire the essential skills for looking at, analyzing and understanding architecture. The final goal is to turn use architecture as a way to look at the places that we inhabit, an action for positive change, and a generator of a vision for making possible worlds.\r\nOur basic questions\r\n\r\nWhat are current trends in architecture?\r\nWho are the protagonists that shape our cities?\r\nWhat can architecture do to improve our living conditions?\r\nWhat are the most significant buildings of our time?\r\nHow can we improve the quality of life in our cities?\r\n\r\nWho is this course for and what prior knowledge do you need?\r\nThe course is both for the general public and for people with experience in architecture, so any person can take it. Basic knowledge of architecture is recommended but not necessary. If you are already a student of architecture, this would be a way to expand and further your studies in a global context. If you are already an architect you can learn about the recent developments of the profession and be inspired for your work. if you have general cultural curiosity about architecture, this course will introduce you to some basic concepts that would allow you to understand better the values and importance of architecture.\r\nHow much will you have to work?\r\nLiving in the world of architecture is a full-time job, but you’ll have to spend 2-3 hours per week with your computer and a few more exploring your city. The final assignment will take a few days to complete if you want to qualify for the exposition.\r\nCertification\r\nYou will receive a certificate for the course after you complete all the assignments. If you include it in your CV, remember that the course is offered by \"Open Online Academy, New York.\"\r\nStudy groups and tours\r\nThe course will feature guided virtual tours and study groups.
