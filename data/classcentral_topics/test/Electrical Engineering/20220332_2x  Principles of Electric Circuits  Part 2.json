At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course. \n\nCourse videos are presented in Mandarin with English subtitles.\n\nThe principles of electric circuits are critical for electrical engineering and computer science students. In this course, we will cover linear and nonlinear resistive circuits, and dynamic circuits in time and phasor domains. In addition to learning critical methods for analyzing circuits, the course will discuss modern circuit elements, such as MOSFETs and Op Amps, used in cutting-edge technologies. This course provides a solid introduction to the real-world application of electric circuits. You will gain a deeper understanding of the important role circuits play in our lives.\n\nFor the part 2 of the course, dynamic circuits containing capacitors and/or inductors will be the main actors. Plenty of excellent examples will be discussed.\n\n电路原理课程是电类各专业最重要的一门学科基础课，后续各专业基础课和专业课都建立在这门课程的知识体系之上，因此是电类专业本科生的“看家 课”之一。电路原理课程的主要内容包括：线性电阻电路分析、非线性电阻电路分析、动态电路的时域分析和正弦激励下动态电路的稳态分析4大部分。清华大学电 路原理课程的教学包括电路分析基本方法、当代电路元器件、电路原理的实际工程应用等，为学生提供了扎实的基础和丰富的应用。 作为本课程的第2部分，重点讲授动态电路，其中电容和电感将成为主角。课程中将讨论众多精彩的实例。\n\n                                    ",
