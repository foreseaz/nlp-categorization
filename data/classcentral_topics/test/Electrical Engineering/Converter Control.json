The equivalent circuit models derived in the previous courses are extended to model small-signal ac variations. These models are then solved, to find the important transfer functions of the converter and its regulator system. Finally, the feedback loop is modeled, analyzed, and designed to meet requirements such as output regulation, bandwidth and transient response, and rejection of disturbances.\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to design and analyze the feedback systems of switching regulators.\n\nThis course assumes prior completion of courses Introduction to Power Electronics and Converter Circuits.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Ch 7: AC Equivalent Circuit ModelingHow to extend the converter steady-state equivalent circuits, derived in the previous courses, to obtain small-signal ac equivalent circuits that model the important converter and regulator system dynamics.Ch 8: Converter Transfer Functions - Part 1A review of the construction of Bode plots of the magnitude and phase of first-order, second-order, and higher-order transfer functions, with emphasis on techniques needed for design of regulator systems.
