In this course we aim to persuade you that, to the contrary, play is immensely varied, important and complex across the whole span of our lives.\n\nIn this course we’ll introduce you to a range of play worlds and play lives. We’ll be taking in the history of play at the Museum of Childhood in London; discovering how everyday knowledge informs playfulness and imagination; visiting virtual worlds where the boundaries between fantasy and reality are blurred; exploring outdoor play spaces in towns, cities and parks; looking at how play spaces can be designed to encourage playfulness; and seeing what happens when players bend the rules.\n\nWe’ll also look at play as the subject of serious study by talking to academics across a range of Social Sciences  disciplines here at the University of Sheffield. We’ll discuss definitions of play and current debates about how the nature of play changes - does play help us to learn? Can it prepare young people to be successful in the adult world? How do we learn to subvert the rules? Are all forms of play good for us? We’ll also talk about the regular media panics about the presumed dangers of technology-related play, such as computer games.\n\nThe knowledge that you gain from this course may inspire you to follow a career related to play, or in the creative industries; it may encourage you to be a more playful parent or carer, which is the foundation of bonding from the very first games of peek-a-boo; we may also persuade you that play is a fundamental part of innovation and creativity across a whole range of subjects, careers, disciplines and industries from fashion to engineering, from teaching to business.\n\nThrough this course we hope to help you to think differently about play, and discover why something that is so often taken for granted is actually very important and significant to us all.\n\nRead more about this course on the FutureLearn blog.\n\n\n                                    ",
