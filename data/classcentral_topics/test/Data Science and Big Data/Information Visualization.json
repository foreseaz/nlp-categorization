It teaches the process of producing effective visualizations that take the needs of users into account. This year, the course can be taken for three Indiana University credits as part of the Online Data Science Program just announced by the School of Informatics and Computing. Students interested in applying to the program can find more information here.Among other topics, the course covers:\r\n\r\nData analysis algorithms that enable extraction of patterns and trends in data\r\nMajor temporal, geospatial, topical, and network visualization techniques\r\nDiscussions of systems that drive research and development.\r\n\r\nJust like last year, students will have the opportunity to collaborate on real-world projects for a variety of clients. Click here to see the 2014 list of clients and projects. You can also see the detailed results of the 2013 client projects from the Visual Insights book here.Everyone who registers gains free access to the Scholarly Database(26 million paper, patent, and grant records) and the Sci2 Tool (100+ algorithms and tools).\n\n                                    ",
