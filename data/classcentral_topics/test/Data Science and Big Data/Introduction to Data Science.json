Skills required for data analytics at massive levels – scalable\ndata management on and off the cloud, parallel algorithms, statistical\nmodeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms\n– span a variety of disciplines and are not easy to obtain through conventional\ncurricula. Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL\nand NoSQL solutions for massive data management (e.g., MapReduce and contemporaries),\nalgorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering and association rule mining),\nand basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression).\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 0: Introduction \n\n    Examples, data science articulated, history and context, technology\n        landscape\nPart 1: Data\nManipulation at Scale\n\n    Databases and the relational algebra \n        \n    \n    Parallel databases, parallel query processing, in-database analytics MapReduce, Hadoop, relationship to databases, algorithms, extensions,\n        languages  Key-value stores and NoSQL; tradeoffs of SQL and NoSQL\nPart 2: Analytics\n\n\n    Topics in statistical modeling: basic concepts, experiment design, pitfalls\n    \n    Topics in machine learning: supervised learning (rules, trees, forests, nearest neighbor, regression), optimization (gradient descent and variants), unsupervised learning\nPart 3: Communicating Results \n\n    Visualization, data products, visual data analytics \n        \n    \n    Provenance, privacy, ethics, governance Part 4: Special Topics\n    Graph Analytics: structure, traversals, analytics, PageRank, community detection, recursive queries, semantic webGuest Lectures\n\n                                    ",
