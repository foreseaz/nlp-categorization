This is all.\r\nThe proposed experiments explore the concepts presented in the course 'Classical Mechanics' that is taught in all universities. They introduce participants to a scientific description of motion by doing themselves experiments at home (no lab required).\r\nThe experiments are organised in 5 sessions: the pendulum (S3) and the free fall (S1) with illustrations directly from Galileo and Newton, while the Session 2 (S2) deals with rotation and Session 4 (S4) with oscillations and vibrations.In Session 5 (S5), you do your own experiment: you can study trajectory of a bicycle, of a train. As an example, we show you how to quantitatively study the trajectory, speed and acceleration of a tramway. New ideas welcomed.\r\n \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1 Free fall and 1D motion (start, move an stop)Session 2 Circular motionSession 3 PendulumSession 4 Mechanical oscillationsSession 5 Motion in real life: train, bicycle,...\n                                    ",
