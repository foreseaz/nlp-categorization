Most learners and engineering students may choose to study only the basics. Those who want to learn at the level of a physics major should study the advanced sections of the course as well. However, the final examination will only cover the basic parts.\n\n本电磁学课程主要学习电场和磁场，一般需要28学时 (7周左右)。视频分为基本内容和提高内容（打星或双星），普通学习者和工科学生只需选择基本内容学习，要达到物理专业的学习要求，则需要额外学习提高内容。最后考试只覆盖基本内容。\n\n                                    ",
