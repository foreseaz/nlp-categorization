The experiments’ much anticipated success confirms predictions made decades earlier by Peter Higgs and others, and offers a glimpse into a universe of physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nAs Professor Peter Higgs continues his inspiring role at Edinburgh University’s School of Physics &amp; Astronomy, the experiments at the LHC continue.\n\nThis free online course introduces the theoretical tools needed to appreciate the discovery, and presents the elementary particles that have been discovered at the tiniest scales ever explored. Beginning with basic concepts in classical mechanics, the story unfolds through relativity and quantum mechanics, describing forces, matter and the unification of theories with an understanding driven by the tools of mathematics.\n\nNarrating the journey through experimental results which led to the discovery in 2012, the course invites you to learn from a team of world-class physicists at Edinburgh University. Learners participate in discussion of the consequences of the Higgs boson, to physics and cosmology, and towards a stronger understanding and new description of the universe.\n\nPhoto of Professor Higgs © Peter Tuffy, The University of Edinburgh\n\n\n                                    ",
