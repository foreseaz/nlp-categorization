It will prepare you for degree-level study, by helping you understand and apply thermodynamic fundamentals through real-world, problem-solving exercises.\n\nUnderstand the first and second laws of thermodynamics\nThermodynamics is concerned with heat and work, and the conversion of energy between the two. The course will introduce two important laws of nature that govern this conversion – the first and second laws of thermodynamics – and discuss the usefulness of energy and entropy functions in relation to them.\n\nWe will also explore the influence of several physical variables on the change of energy and entropy functions, and introduce additional functions, such as enthalpy, which are useful in dealing with physical and chemical equilibrium.\n\nDiscover how thermodynamics governs the universe and our everyday lives\nBy the end of the course, you will be comfortable discussing the laws of thermodynamics and how they govern the largest thermodynamic system of all – the Universe.\n\nYou may think that engineering theory is difficult to understand, but this course will help you master it with ease, through examples from our everyday lives.\n\n\n                                    ",
