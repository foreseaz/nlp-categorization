We will look at the ways in which the extraordinary family histories of Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un and Park Geun-hye embody the complex relationship between lips and teeth.\n\nPainting on a broad historical canvas, we will learn why Chinese and Koreans have insisted on remaining as close as “lips and teeth,” and yet how difficult that ideal is to achieve in reality.\n\nThe educator for this course is John Delury, Professor of Chinese history and Sino-Korean relations at Yonsei University, and co-author of the acclaimed book, “Wealth &amp; Power: China’s Long March to the 21st Century.”\n\nYou can find out more in John’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “Lips and teeth: weaving the ‘tangled skein’ of Korea and China’s history.”\n\n\n                                    ",
