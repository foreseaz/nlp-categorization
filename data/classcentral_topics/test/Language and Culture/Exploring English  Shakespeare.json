They will explain and explore the universal themes Shakespeare addressed in his work.\n\nThe plays are: Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing, The Tempest and Macbeth.\n\nOur video tutor will guide you through the course and look at some of the words and expressions that Shakespeare introduced to the English language.\n\nShort quizzes will check your understanding and you’ll be asked to share your ideas and opinions on the topics Shakespeare raises.\n\nThis course is one of three courses from the British Council’s Exploring English course collection.\n\n\n                                    ",
