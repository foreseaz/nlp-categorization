You'll write code in Python to fight forest fires, rescue the Apollo 13 astronauts, stop the spread of epidemics, and resolve other real-world dilemmas.Why Take This Course?By the end of this course, you'll develop an intuition for the use of differential equations in the applied sciences. You'll also learn how to build mathematical models for systems of differential equations using a variety of techniques. Along the way, you'll learn how to translate mathematical expressions into Python code and solve some really cool problems!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Rescuing Apollo 13, Part 1\n\nIntroduction to the Forward Euler Method\n\n### Lesson 2: Rescuing Apollo 13, Part 2\n\nComparing solvers, Heun’s Method, and the Symplectic Euler Method\n\n### Lesson 3: Analyzing the Spread of Diseases\n\nImplicit methods and stiffness\n\n### Lesson 4: There’s Plenty of Fish in the Sea?\n\nStability, sensitivity, and optimization\n\n### Lesson 5: Antilock Brake Systems\n\nFriction, equilibria, and control theory\n\n### Lesson 6: The Path of a Forest Fire\n\nPartial differential equations and heat conduction\n\n### Lesson 7: Advanced Applications of Numerical Methods\n\nChaos, software, and predictive capability\n                                    ",
