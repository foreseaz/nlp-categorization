    "description": "Due to the globalization, the mobility of knowledge and labor has quickened. With the assistance of globalization, Shakespeare studies have reached five continents. Last year, the first Asian Shakespearean Association was founded, whose members are scholars dedicated to Shakespeare studies in Asia, coming from Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Philippines, China, India, Europe and America. Because of frequent intercultural exchanges nowadays, Shakespeare is not an asset which belongs to the English culture alone. His works are adapted, appropriated and rewritten all over the world, springing up like mushrooms after rain, and productions range from stage performances, films, television adaptations, comics, animations, musicals, operas and in other forms of pop culture. This course will begin with an introduction to the rhythm of Shakespeares Sonnets and soliloquies. After being acquainted with the beauty of his verse, we will have selective readings of the Shakespeares plays, especially the ones the most related to the development of Shakespeare in Taiwan. By using manga adaptations to read Shakespeares texts, this course hopes to present diverse Shakespearean interpretations. The course curriculum includes reading Shakespeares texts in a scenario, role-playing, analyzing Shakespeare manga adaptations, staging a Shakespeare scene and other course activities to fulfill various learning and assessments.\n",
