Looking for a smart way visualize your data in order to make sense out of it? We’ve got you covered!\nUsing video lectures and hands-on exercises, we will teach you cutting-edge techniques and best practices that will boost your data analysis and visualization skills.\nWe will take a deep dive into data analysis with spreadsheets: PivotTables, VLOOKUPS, Named ranges, what-if analyses, making great graphs - all those will be covered in the first weeks of the course. After that, we will investigate the quality of the spreadsheet model, and especially how to make sure your spreadsheet remains error-free and robust.\nFinally, once we have mastered spreadsheets, we will demonstrate other ways to store and analyze data. We will also look into how Python, a programming language, can help us with analyzing and manipulating data in spreadsheets.\nEX101x is created using Excel 2013 and Windows. Most assignments can be made using another spreadsheet program and operating system as well, but we cannot offer full support for all configurations.\nThe goal of this course is to help you to overcome data analysis challenges in your work, research or studies. Therefore we encourage you to participate actively and to raise real data analysis problems that you face in our discussion forums. \nThis course is part of the Data Analysis XSeries.\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

Powerful concepts such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are progressively introduced throughout the five weeks. Examples and case studies are provided so that learners can implement simple programs on their own or by collaborating with peers.\nPart 2 will focus on how to write “good” programs and Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures. Part 2 and Part 3 will be scheduled soon.\nProgramming knowledge is not only needed to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones, but it also opens doors to computational thinking, i.e., the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.\nWith new content and enhanced problems, this is an improved version of the course released in April 2015. Previous learners are welcome to enroll for a second time, and continue learning!\nThroughout this course, emphasis is placed on immediate feedback and having fun. Enroll today and start your journey in the field of computer science!\n“This course is Awesome. And professor Carlos, Just WOW! His video lectures are so clear and so full of enthusiasm that I decided to upgrade to a verified track, which I'm doing for the first time in edX. I'm loving Java!” – Past student\n",

    "description": "Think about your favourite wine. Imagine the brilliance of its colour in the glass, the ripe fruit aromas on the nose, a hint of toasty oak and lingering tannins on the back palate. Perhaps you like a specific wine, but can’t pinpoint the reason why. The attributes that make wine so enjoyable are achieved through the expertise of viticulturists and winemakers, whose decision-making in the vineyard and winery is underpinned by science – to be precise, viticulture and oenology.\nThe finer details can take years to learn, but in a matter of weeks this course will give you a broad understanding of the principles and practices used to grow grapes and make wine, and their impact on wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste. You’ll also gain an appreciation for how cutting-edge research is helping to secure the future sustainability of the global wine industry. Whether you’re a wine novice or a seasoned oenophile,, this course is for anyone who loves wine and wine tasting. You’ll even get to make your own wine-- virtually at least!\nConfidently describe wine appearance, aroma, flavour and taste.\n",

Learning algorithms enable a wide range of applications, from everyday tasks such as product recommendations and spam filtering to bleeding edge applications like self-driving cars and personalized medicine. In the age of ‘big data’, with datasets rapidly growing in size and complexity and cloud computing becoming more pervasive, machine learning techniques are fast becoming a core component of large-scale data processing pipelines.\nThis statistics and data analysis course introduces the underlying statistical and algorithmic principles required to develop scalable real-world machine learning pipelines. We present an integrated view of data processing by highlighting the various components of these pipelines, including exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, supervised learning, and model evaluation. You will gain hands-on experience applying these principles using Spark, a cluster computing system well-suited for large-scale machine learning tasks, and its packages spark.ml and spark.mllib. You will implement distributed algorithms for fundamental statistical models (linear regression, logistic regression, principal component analysis) while tackling key problems from domains such as online advertising and cognitive neuroscience.\n",

En 2050 habrá en la región el triple de adultos mayores que ahora, con una mayor esperanza de vida y, por lo tanto mayores necesidades de atención.\nEsos adultos mayores del futuro están hoy en un mercado de trabajo donde sólo 4 de cada 10 trabajadores contribuyen a un sistema de pensiones. Esto significa que en la actualidad 130 millones de personas están trabajando sin ahorrar para su pensión en ALC.\nEn ausencia de reformas, incluso con un crecimiento sostenido en la región, 1 de cada 2 jubilados no tendrá una pensión o esta no será adecuada, dejando entre 66 y 83 millones de adultos mayores dependiendo de las familias o del Estado para su manutención, lo que será económica, fiscal y socialmente insostenible.\nPor otra parte, aquellos sistemas que prometen beneficios más generosos tienen baja cobertura y eventuales problemas de equidad y sustentabilidad. Lo que genera un importante desafío, ya que el aumentar la cobertura bajo el mismo diseño puede mejorar la situación financiera en el corto plazo, pero acrecentar los problemas de sustentabilidad en el largo plazo.\nEn este curso comprenderemos las complejidades que afronta el mercado de trabajo en ALC y, por ende, su sistema de pensiones. Vamos a esclarecer las políticas que se pueden formular en los diferentes contextos de la Región que podrían llevar a un funcionamiento de sistemas de pensiones más eficientes, financieramente sostenibles y equitativos y así ofrecer “mejores pensiones” a todos los adultos mayores, no solo a unos pocos.\nLa preparación de este curso fue financiada por el Programa Especial para el Desarrollo Institucional (SPID) del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

However, bringing technology into the classroom in a productive way is easier said than done. How do educators and others decide what kind and type of educational technology to use in the classroom? Which stakeholders influence that decision? What factors determine the success or failure of educational technology initiatives? How do we determine if these implementations are successful? \nThis course provides a practical overview for selecting, integrating, implementing, and evaluating educational technology initiatives in formal educational settings, primarily in the US. It will include the perspectives of stakeholders that make such initiatives possible, and consider how to evaluate for efficacy. The audience for this course includes current and future teachers, entrepreneurs, developers, practitioners, and leaders in educational technology. \nThrough four units over seven weeks, participants will develop an awareness and understanding of the “ecosystem” surrounding the implementation of educational technology in a formal educational setting. Participants will work towards creating a final project that synthesizes the main ideas from the course. \n",

    "description": "Three things are clear about today’s music industry: The consumption of music is expanding at the greatest rate in history and from the most portals ever imagined, the cost of producing music is decreasing, and the number of artists creating and seeking to expose their work and develop careers through the Internet has increased dramatically. As demand grows and Internet piracy wanes, ad-supported and subscription models will generate unprecedented revenues that will surpass even the best of past earnings. And, many astute “music industry-watchers” predict a steep rise in business activity and trade earnings by the end of the decade.\nWhether you’re a music creator, consumer, or facilitator of this process, you’ll want to understand the history, underpinnings, and basics of the music business. This course has been developed to provide students with the latest instruction on the best way for creators, consumers, and facilitators to navigate the resurgence of one of the world’s most exciting industries: the music business. Course author John Kellogg—administrator, educator, entertainment lawyer, performer, and radio and television personality—offers students the opportunity to learn the fundamental principles of the developing new music business, for now and into the future.\n",

In the first two modules, we will explore the deeper socio-cultural meaning of rural vernacular architecture and look at the urban vernacular and challenges of people migrating from villages to live in cities; in module 3, we will focus on what we call ‘informal settlements’ in Asian cities; and in the final two modules, we will explore answers to a few questions that are very relevant to the current status and future development of vernacular architecture, such as:\n\nHow can we conserve and sustain our vernacular cultural heritage?\nHow can we reconcile tradition with modernity and originality?\n\nWe will also cast our eyes into the future, and discuss how the field of vernacular architecture might evolve and develop in the years to come.\nUltimately, the goal of this 5-week course is to help you establish your own viewpoints about the more complex or even contradictory issues in vernacular architecture, so you can make informed decisions regarding the protection and conservation of your local vernacular environments.\nSpecial note: This course can be taken independently from The Search of Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 1.\n",

In fact, only eleven complete copies of Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887 are known to exist. Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes exist, however, and he continues to fascinate readers as an enigmatic detective.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence.

Video lectures will be in Korean, with English subtitles. Discussions, quizzes, and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall.\nThe course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics.\nThe central content of the course is organized into two modules. First, it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: 史記), Plutarch's Lives, and History of the Three Kingdoms (한국어: 삼국사기; Chinese: 三國史記) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity, conflict and cooperation among political entities, development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity, and leadership selection in an entity.\nThe second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012, the arms race between the two Koreas, the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea, and upcoming political events.\nCourse videos are presented in Korean with English subtitles.\nThe main course image is copyright © 2013 Seoul National University News.\n",

    "description": "Have you wondered about the design strategies behind temperature controllers, quad-copters, or self-balancing scooters? Are you interested in robotics, and have heard of, or tried, “line-following\" or “PID control” and want to understand more?\nFeedback control is a remarkably pervasive engineering principle. Feedback control uses sensor data (e.g. brightness, temperature, or velocity) to adjust or correct actuation (e.g. steering angle, motor acceleration, or heater output), and you use it all the time, like when you steer a bicycle, catch a ball, or stand upright. But even though applications of feedback are very common, the subject is an uncommonly compelling example of mathematical theory guiding practical design. In this engineering course we will introduce you to the theory and practice of feedback control and provide a glimpse into this rich and beautiful subject.\nEach week we will begin with a mathematical description of a fundamental feedback concept, combined with on-line exercises to test your understanding, and will finish with you designing, implementing, measuring, and analyzing a hardware system, that you build, for controlling a propeller-levitated-arm feedback system.\nYou will not need a background in calculus or software engineering to succeed in this class but you should be familiar with algebra and mechanical forces, have some exposure to complex numbers, and be comfortable with modifying mathematical formulas in short computer programs.\nThis is a lab course, and in order to complete the weekly assignments, you will need to purchase/acquire a list of parts. To make sure you receive your parts before the class begins, you should register promptly, so that you can access the lists of parts and international vendors.\n",

This education and teacher training course is intended to give a brief introduction for academic or clinical-based educators who desire to learn the simulation pedagogy unique to healthcare environments.\nUnfortunately, being a great clinical educator does not always translate into being a great simulation educator. In this course, you will learn best practices for simulation in healthcare education and why it’s so important. Faculty experts will show you how developing simulation curricular tools can be used to train and evaluate providers. While many educators use simulation, not all are utilizing it to its full potential. Simulation in healthcare is only growing and experience in this educational tool is beneficial to all that educate or have aspirations to have a positive affect on patient outcomes.\n \nLearner Testimonial \n“I cannot tell you how valuable learning about healthcare simulation was to my professional development, I refer back to it constantly in my role as a nursing educator.”-- Previous Student\n",

    "description": "La finance est omniprésente et les décisions financières nous concernent tous. Tout individu est un jour ou l’autre amené à épargner ou emprunter. La sélection des projets d’investissements et leur financement sont des questions cruciales pour les entrepreneurs ou managers. D’une manière plus large, les décisions prises par le monde politique en matières financières influencent directement ou indirectement le quotidien des citoyens. Les récentes crises financières ont pu nous montrer à quel point il peut être primordial de comprendre les fondamentaux de la finance. Sans un minimum d’éducation financière, il est difficile d’appréhender le fonctionnement du monde dans lequel nous évoluons. Ce cours introductif vous propose un cadre conceptuel et des outils pour vous aider à prendre des décisions financières judicieuses, avec un focus particulier sur les opérations financières courantes.   \r\n \r\nAu terme de ce cours, vous serez capable de :\n\nDécrire les principes fondamentaux du raisonnement financier : absence d’opportunités d’arbitrage dans un marché concurrentiel, intégration de la dimension temporelle et du risque dans la décision financière ;\nCalculer des valeurs actuelles ou futures, de flux ou de séquence de flux ;\nAppliquer les techniques de l’évaluation actuarielle aux opérations financières courantes (de type épargne ou emprunt) et aux principaux actifs financiers (actions et obligations) ;\nUtiliser les différents outils de sélection d’investissement pour des projets en entreprise ;\nAnalyser la problématique de la décision d’investissement, en tenant compte du lien entre rendement attendu et risque ;\nDéterminer le taux de rendement qu’une entreprise doit utiliser lorsqu’elle doit prendre une décision d’investissement et utiliser ce taux pour calculer la valeur générée par un projet ;\nSuivre des cours de finance plus avancés (finance d’entreprise, gestion de portefeuille, marchés financiers, finance internationale, produits dérivés, etc.).\n\n\nFinancial decisions impact all of us. As individuals we earn money, spend it, borrow it and at times save and invest it. At work, for managers or entrepreneurs, financial decisions are crucial. In the public sector , financial decisions made by politicians affect us every day. Without minimal financial literacy, it is very difficult to succeed, especially in light of the recent financial crises. This introductory course provides a framework and tools to help you make sound financial decisions, with a particular focus on common financial operations.\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe the basics of financial reasoning: absence of arbitrage opportunity in a competitive market, decision-making based on both time and risk ;\nCalculate present or future values of cash-flows or sequences of cash-flows ;\nApply the principles of valuation to value common financial operations (savings or loans) and main financial assets (stocks and bonds);\nUse different criteria to select investment projects in firms ; \nAnalyze capital budgeting problems, involving the relationship between expected return and risk ;\nDetermine the return a firm should use when facing an investment decision, and use this return to compute the value generated by a project ; \nTake more advanced courses in finance (corporate finance, portfolio management, financial markets, international finance, derivative securities, etc.). \n\n\n Ce cours est enseigné en français.

    "description": "The Indian healthcare sector is garnering global attention. Be it the evolution of Indian pharmaceutical firms, low-cost hospitals or disruptive start-ups, the sector is a laboratory of myriad market forces impacting innovation, choices and societal welfare. At the same time, India continues to battle with an inadequate healthcare infrastructure and a rising disease burden.\nThis business course applies a strategic lens to the sector’s submarkets including hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and diagnostic equipment providers. You will examine the role of disruptive innovation and the ways in which public policy shapes the evolution of healthcare markets. With this framework, you will be able to evaluate which employer to join, which healthcare stocks to invest in, where the exciting business opportunities lie, and what are the unmet needs in this sector that can be addressed by a startup.\nIf you are a healthcare enthusiast, a part of the industry, a policy maker, an investor or an entrepreneur, this is the course for you. \n",

However, in the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists concluding humans are causing global warming.\n\nWhy the gap between the public and scientists?\nWhat are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the scientific consensus?\nHow has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change?\n\nThis course examines the science of climate science denial.\nWe will look at the most common climate myths from “global warming stopped in 1998” to “global warming is caused by the sun” to “climate impacts are nothing to worry about.”\nWe’ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You’ll learn both the science of climate change and the techniques used to distort the science.\nWith every myth we debunk, you’ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge, you’ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.\nThis isn’t just a climate MOOC; it’s a MOOC about how people think about climate change.\n",

Did you know that scientists have linked their movement into specific genes to the causes of certain diseases? You’ll also learn how these “jumping genes” work and how scientists study them in Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.\nAre you ready to go beyond the “what\" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?\nTake a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in transcription and transposition to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.\nLet’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the transcription machinery and mechanisms of transposition. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28.2x Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.\nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time.

All of the resources are free and designed to be equally accessible and transformative for a wide audience.\n\r\nYou will gain access to a supportive learning community led by Professor Gregory Nagy and his Board of Readers, who model techniques for “reading out” of ancient texts. This approach allows readers with little or even no experience in the subject matter to begin seeing this literature as an exquisite, perfected system of communication.\nNo previous knowledge of Greek history, literature, or language is required. This is a project for students of any age, culture, and geographic location, and its profoundly humanistic message can be easily received without previous acquaintance with Western Classical literature.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

    "description": "Supply Chains are complex systems involving multiple firms and organizations with different goals and objectives.  Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain’s efficiency and effectiveness.  Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional. \nThis course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x.  It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry.  We will divide the course into three sections. \nFirst, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics.  Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements.  The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. \nSecond, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk.  Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain.  Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. \nFinally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships.  Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.\nThis course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC3x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos. \nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.

The ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently affected several countries around the world!\nMore recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more \"globally interconnected.\" Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008.\nIntroduction to Banking and Financial Markets - I helped learners understand the theory and concepts underlying banking and financial markets, the products and instruments offered and the underlying market mechanisms.\nThis next economics and finance course will discuss:\n\nThe complex ecosystem of banking and financial market in a global context\nThe appending risks in that ecosystem\nHow these risks and potential adverse outcomes are addressed and redressed using several risk mitigation techniques and sound regulatory oversight\n\n",

This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures.\nTo help enhance your learning experience, this course offers instructor grading. If you choose to pursue a verified certificate, a professional philosopher will carefully read, grade and comment upon your work. Though all residential philosophy courses at MIT, and other major universities, offer instructor grading, this is an innovation in the world of MOOCs. Students will test their ideas against, and receive individual advice from, professional philosophers. We believe that this is the best way to learn philosophy.\nNOTE: Enrollment for instructor grading will be capped.\n",

    "description": "This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning. \nSince these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not \"computation appreciation\" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat type of computing environment do I need for this course?\n\nYou need to have a computer running one of the following operating systems:\nMicrosoft Windows, version XP or greater (XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7)\nApple OSX, version 10.2 or greater\nLinux - most distributions that have been released within the past two years should work\nIn addition, you will need the ability to download, install, and run software on your computer.\n\n\nWhat browser should I use?\n\nWe strongly recommend that you use the Chrome browser while visiting the edX site. This site is optimized for viewing in Chrome. \nIf you cannot use Chrome, you should use the Firefox browser. Be advised you may have trouble with site functionality if you choose to use an alternate browser.\n\n\nWhat programming language(s) will this course use?\n\n6.00x will be using the Python programming language, version 3.5. \nYou are not expected to have any prior programming knowledge - this course is intended for students who have little to no experience with any programming language.\n\n\nWhat is the format of the class?\n\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these may contain integrated \"check-yourself\" questions. \nThere will also be programming assignments and standalone exams/quizzes, which are not part of the video lectures.\n\n\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\n\nYes, transcripts of the course will be made available.\n\n\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\n\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure - you do not need to watch the lectures at any set time.\n\n\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\n\nNothing: the course is free.\n\n\n\n",

We will illustrate the workings of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies by using a simple Keynesian model of an open economy. In the final module you will design an IMF–supported lending program scenario for our country case.\nFinancial Programming and Policies, Part 2 is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.\n",

    "description": "This MIT and Harvard co-taught course examines Japanese history and uncovers the skills and questions involved in reading history through digital imagery. The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.\nThe course will cover the following topics in four modules:\n\nModule 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?\nModule 1: Black Ships & Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.\nModule 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive \"Hibiya Riot\" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of \"imperial democracy\" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.\nModule 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido & Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.\n\nThe course is based on the MIT \"Visualizing Cultures\" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu).\nNOTES:\nUTokyo001x and UTokyo002x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, Parts 1 & 2 by University of Tokyo, follow in this series.\nFor MIT students: VJx will continue to be part of 21F.027J Visualizing Japan in the Modern World, a residential course taught by Professor Miyagawa in Fall semesters.\nIn addition to MITx and HarvardX, this project is supported by the U.S. Japan Foundation, the University of Tokyo, and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.\nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field.\nToday's global IT infrastructures are distributed systems; from the Internet to the data-centers of cloud computing that fuel the current revolution of global IT services. At the core of these services you find distributed algorithms.\nThese algorithms run on multiple computers and communicate only by sending and receiving messages. It is crucial for the implemented services to continue to work 24/7 even if some of the computers fail or some of the messages are lost in transit. This is the subject of reliable distributed algorithms in computer science.\nID2203.1x covers models of distributed algorithms based on input/output automata; specifications of fault tolerant abstractions and failure detectors; specific distributed abstractions and fault-tolerant algorithms, including reliable broadcast and causal broadcast; key-value stores and consistency models; single-value consensus and the Paxos algorithm.\nTo complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments.\n",

Additional Harvard colleagues will also share with you their thoughts on topics such as disability law as it relates to reproductive technology.\nWhile the law and ethics surrounding these technologies are a central component to this course, we also show you examples of the deeply personal and human side of these issues. Throughout the course, and with the help of law students, we will discuss leading legal cases in this field, which will illuminate the types of questions the law has struggled with – stretching and evolving over time. From the famous Baby M surrogacy case, to cases on the paternity of sperm donors, to a case related to the ownership of human tissue turned into a commercial product, and others. We will show you the ethical, legal, and rhetorical underpinnings, which have served as the basis for various court decisions over the past 20 or 30 years. We will also explore potential future technologies and their implications for society: genetic enhancements to increase our intelligence, let us live a hundred years longer, or make us immune to diseases – and the possibility of creating animal-human hybrids, for example a mouse with a humanized brain.\nThe content within this course is intended to be instructive, and show how legal reasoning has been applied, or could be applied, to questions related to parenthood, reproduction, and other issues surrounding human genetic material. The material organized within this course should be considered an authoritative overview, but is not intended to serve as medical or legal advice.\nThis course is designed for a diverse audience including, but not limited to, law students, prospective law students, medical professionals, as well as members of the general public interested in questions and topics related to surrogacy, parenthood, genetic and reproductive technology, ownership of genetic material, and more. You do not need any background in law, medicine, philosophy, or really any subject to enjoy this course. This course is meant to be an introduction for anyone interested in these topics.\n \n\nHonor Code\r\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

Most traditional methods are of a repetitive, rule-based nature and will be gradually replaced by Artificial Intelligence. In the knowledge era, the most value added job will be to manage knowledge, which includes how knowledge is created, mined, processed, shared and reused in different trades and industry. At the same time, the amount of data and information (prerequisites of knowledge) is exploding exponentially. By 2020, IDC projects that the size of the digital universe will reach 40 zetabytes from all sources including, websites, weblog, sensors, and social media. Big data will transform how we live, work and even think. These trends and more will have a profound effect on how we see the world and create policies. In this course, the following topics are covered:\n\nWhat is knowledge management?\nHow is knowledge captured, elicited, organized and created in business?\nWhat is big data and how can we use data analytics from a laymen perspective?\nWhat is Open Linked Data and how can it support machine reasoning?\nWhat defines the era of Science 2.0?\nHow can new knowledge be mined from big data?\nWhat are the technical and social problems with big data?\nWhat is cloud computing and cloud services?\nWhat are examples of applications and case studies?\n\nThe course is offered by the Knowledge Management and Innovation Research Center (KMIRC) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Most of our research is company and industry based. Capabilities and competencies of the KMIRC are further strengthened by the international alliances it has formed with leading practitioners, many of which are regarded as members of the \"Hall of Fame\" in knowledge management, and renowned worldwide. The course is suitable for participants with a background in humanities, management, social science, physical science or engineering. No prior technical background is needed.\n",

Around the world, people who are fed up with environmental degradation and the breakdown of their communities come together to transform blighted vacant lots, trashed-out stream corridors, polluted estuaries, and other “broken places.” Civic ecology practices—such as community gardening, wetlands restoration, river cleanups, and tree planting—are a means for people to express resilience and rebuild communities marked by disaster and disinvestment.\nCivic ecology draws on psychology, sociology, political science, education, ecology, and social-ecological systems resilience to understand how and why people care for nature and their communities.\nThroughout this course, you will:\n\nExplore the people, places, and practices that restore nature and revitalize neighborhoods, making a difference in ways big and small.\nDiscuss and evaluate contemporary thinking in resilience, social-ecological systems, and the relationship between nature and human/community wellbeing.\nGrasp an understanding of how civic ecology enables those with limited resources to defy and cope with daily struggles, including after disaster and war.\nAcquire the knowledge and skill set to enact change in your own community.\nParticipate in a civic ecology service learning project to turn classroom learning into real-life application.\n\nThis course is ideal for a learner who is intrigued by both social and environmental concerns, or simply has a desire to dive into an emerging 21st century, cross-disciplinary subject area. You will complete this course with a keener awareness of social-ecological issues and concerns, as well as a greater knowledge of the practical steps required to rebuild and maintain community and nature in a world marked by inequality, conflict, and climate change.\n",

    "description": "\"A free eight-week Science of Happiness course that will offer practical, research-backed tips on living a happy and meaningful life.\"  - The Huffington Post\nWe all want to be happy, and there are countless ideas about what happiness is and how we can get some. But not many of those ideas are based on science. That’s where this course comes in.\n“The Science of Happiness” is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.\nWhat’s more, “The Science of Happiness” offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.\nThe course’s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal. They’ll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude—experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Health professionals who register can earn continuing education units for their participation.\nConsider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track. Join the conversation on The Greater Good Science Center Facebook page, or in the BerkeleyX: GG101x The Science of Happiness Facebook group.\n",

This course is the first of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.\nThe 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.\nPart 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.\nPart 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.\nPart 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).\n \n",

This course is Part 1 of a 4-part series on Business Statistics, and is ideal for learners who wish to enroll in business programs. The first two courses cover topics in Descriptive Statistics, whereas the next two courses focus on Inferential Statistics.\nSpreadsheets containing real data from diverse areas such as economics, finance and HR drive much of our discussions.  \nIn Part 1, we shall be exploring multiple ways to describe these datasets, numerically as well as visually. Throughout, we shall embrace a problem-based approach to understanding the material: the primary reason to pick up a tool or a technique will be to solve a problem. Our course makes judicious use of tools.\nIn Part 2, we shall take up a few datasets that have over a million rows, which makes it impossible to analyze using a spreadsheet. This is a natural setting for R, an advanced statistical programming platform. The courses incorporate helpful tutorials to get learners acquainted with both the mechanisms. Parts 3 and 4 are dedicated to Inferential Statistics. In Part 3, we begin by exploring the benefits of random sampling, and apply the Central Limit Theorem to arrive at confidence intervals for important population parameters. We also learn how to formulate hypotheses for business data, and resolve them with the testing framework that we establish. Along the way, we shall compare two or more populations and draw inferences with a set of statistical tests.\nYou will learn all these concepts with the help of various demonstrations, which show real-life application of the concepts related to business situations.\n",

It examines the emergence of an international system of competitive empires and its effect on trade and exchange. We look at the Age of Revolution, and discuss industrialization during the 1800s. The course concludes with a close look at the 20th century and current-day globalization.\nCourse themes include migration and statelessness, economic integration, warfare and conflict, the transformation of the ecological balance, and cultural responses and innovations. To grapple with these themes, we explore first-hand perspectives of historical actors through a collection of texts and images.\n***\nWe are grateful to our partnership with InZone at the University of Geneva for their collaboration, and for the support from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the Norwegian Refugee Council to make this possible.\n***\nCourse material\r\nFor you to engage in this experience, Global History Lab will provide you with historical content and a series of collaborative lab activities. Although the lectures are designed to be self-contained, we recommend (but do not require) that you refer to the book Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of the World: From 1000 CE to the Present (Fourth Edition) (vol. 2), which was written specifically for this course.\n",

What experiences in your childhood or when you were a teenager may have shaped your political identity? Join us, along with Gloria Steinem, Loretta Ross, and others, in a seven-week exploration of these questions and more. In this course, you will analyze some of the psychological theories that help explain what leads people to want to change society.\nThrough rich, interactive case studies you will meet nine prominent women activists who were engaged in efforts and movements in the U.S. from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Civil Rights Movement, the LGBTQ Movement, and the Reproductive Justice Movement. Within our online community you will discuss and debate how psychological theories can explain these activists’ motivations, discover where the theories are and are not applicable, and collaboratively create new understandings and analyses.\nEach week, Gloria Steinem (SC ‘56) will provide her thoughts and insight into how these theories might apply to contemporary issues.\nPhoto Credit: Diana Davies\n",

    "description": "Cities are first and foremost built for people, and in today’s world, people produce large amounts of valuable data, thus contributing to what we call “smart cities.\" As almost every building and every city is a prototype, these communities are in the early stage of development and require specific attention and expertise as we advance.\nSmart cities, such as Zurich and Boston, consist of human-made structures or environments that are, in some capacity, monitored, metered, networked and controlled. With this functionality, combined with stationary sensors and mobile devices, data and information have become the new building materials of future cities. Using this data, citizens are now beginning to influence the design of future cities and the re-design of existing ones.\nIn this architecture course, you will learn the basics of information cities and urban science research, as well as how dynamic behavior and citizen-driven learning differentiate the responsive city from the smart city. The cities we present and develop in this course use the stocks and flows of information as the main drivers of change.\nTo deepen your knowledge of smart cities and give a perspective on the future of these cities, we also introduce the concept of citizen design science, a combination of citizen science, urban design, and cognitive design computing. Participants will furthermore have unique access to a design research platform for citizen design science. The intelligent use of data and information is at the core of this course, and these concepts will be the next generation of participatory design and design computing environments.\nThis course is part of the “Future Cities” XSeries, and builds on the experiences from our first two urban MOOCs: Future Cities and Livability in Future Cities.\n",

Studying the science of GMOs helps us understand biotechnology’s potential role in addressing challenges in agriculture.\nIn this introductory Food and Nutrition course, you will learn the basics of genetic engineering, explore the political debate around the GMO and review the arguments for and against their use.\nWe will study the politics surrounding the GMO and its impact at both an individual level and to society as a whole; including the problems, perceptions, benefits, and risks associated with GMOs. Important to understanding the complexities around this topic we will not only be looking at the science behind how the GMO works, but also to the limitations of this science. We will also discuss the importance of information literacy as a tool for effectively identifying and evaluating issues.\nOur goal is that this MOOC will impact people's understanding of science, what it can and can't do, and how information is transmitted. The intent is not to influence how people feel about GMOs, but to give them the critical thinking and scientific literacy tools necessary to make informed decisions — and to understand the broader impacts of those decisions.\n",

What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?\nEach lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation.

Dans ce cours, vous découvrirez les principales caractéristiques des quatre grands secteurs macroéconomiques (réel, financier, extérieur et monétaire), vous apprendrez comment lire, interpréter et analyser les comptes de chacun d’eux, et vous comprendrez à quel point ils sont interdépendants.\r\n(La deuxième partie du cours de PPF portera sur la formulation de projections de base et l’élaboration d’un programme d’ajustement.)\r\n \r\nAu long de ce cours, les économistes du FMI vous guideront dans les comptes et dans l’analyse d’une économie. En outre du suivi de conférences sous forme de vidéos, vous serez appelés à répondre à des questions sur les concepts expliqués, à résoudre de brefs exercices pratiques, à réfléchir avec les autres participants sur l’évolution économique de votre pays, et à travailler sur les données d’un pays imaginaire. Les dossiers de lecture vous seront fournis.\r\n \r\nQue vous soyez un cadre de la fonction publique chargé de dossiers économiques pour votre pays ou que votre travail repose sur l’exploitation de données économiques, ou tout simplement si vous souhaitez mieux comprendre l’évolution économique d’un pays, ce cours vous apportera une formation pratique en analyse macroéconomique, et nous attendons avec intérêt votre participation à ce fascinant apprentissage!\r\n \r\nLa première partie du cours de Programmation et politiques financières est proposée par le FMI avec le concours financier du gouvernement de Belgique.\n",

    "description": "The increased demand by consumers and businesses for more utility, connectivity and smarter and more efficient electronic technology not only creates a need for more embedded systems but also for engineers in the embedded systems field.\nIn this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required.\nEmbedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner.\nIn this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course, where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity.\nThis course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks.\nTo complete this course, you will need to purchase a lab kit including a microcontroller board, an I/O board, and a Bluetooth module. Instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software are at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/RTOS.html .\n",

We will start with discrete-time, binomial trees models, but most of the course will be in the framework of continuous-time, Brownian Motion driven models. A basic introduction to Stochastic, Ito Calculus will be given. The benchmark model will be the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, but we will also discuss more general models, such as stochastic volatility models. We will discuss both the Partial Differential Equations approach, and the probabilistic, martingale approach. We will also cover an introduction to modeling of interest rates and fixed income derivatives.\nI teach the same class at Caltech, as an advanced undergraduate class. This means that the class may be challenging, and demand serious effort. On the other hand, successful completion of the class will provide you with a full understanding of the standard option pricing models, and will enable you to study the subject further on your own, or otherwise. You should have a working knowledge of basic calculus, statistics, and probability and be interested in the use of mathematical modeling.

How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be \"nasty, brutish and short\"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene?

    "description": "Comment définir et comprendre la notion d’espace? Comment l’urbanisation, la mobilité, Internet et la mondialisation ont-ils influencé notre perception du temps et de l’espace? Ce cours a pour objectif de définir la notion d’espace en apportant des clés de lecture pour comprendre les sociétés qui nous entourent.\nÀ la fois théorique et pratique, ce cours privilégie les compétences sur les « contenus » factuels et valorise une approche par l’intelligence collective. Ce cours propose de saisir la notion d’espace à partir de vos expériences quotidiennes, de vos perceptions et de vos pratiques.\nDans EspaceX, nous explorons ensemble la ville, l’urbanisation, l’urbanité, et l’urbanisme, l’acteur individuel au sein d’un Monde mondialisé, les spatialités numériques, le couple espace-temps et la relation complexe entre les sociétés et les mondes bio-physiques. Une large part sera accordée à la cartographie. À l’issue de ce cours, vous serez capable non seulement de lire, mais aussi de dessiner vos propres cartes. Enfin, les problématiques de l’agir spatial et de la justice spatiale seront abordées. Un(e) specialiste reconnu(e) interviendra à chacune des 9 séances sous la forme d’un entretien filmé mettant en lumière la relation de ce chercheur à l’espace.\n",

This course aims to help you feel comfortable with the notion of space. The simplest way to understand it is to connect your daily life, your perceptions and your practices to the concepts of contact and remoteness. In SpaceX, we will explore together the city, urbanisation, urbanity, and urbanism, the individual actor in a globalising World, the emerging digital spatialities, the space-time couple, and the complex relation between societies and bio-physical worlds. Moreover, we will see that cartography is a powerful tool. By the end of the course, we will enable you to not only read but also draw your own maps. Finally, the issues of action on space through spatial agency and spatial justice will be addressed. In each of the nine sessions, a recognised specialist will be filmed in a particular place—a ‘thinking place’—throughout the World, to help us simultaneously inhabit and understand space.\n",

It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\nLouv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You’ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.\nLouv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video.\n",

Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some \"poison\" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame and MSG. Dietary supplements are often touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on.\nThis course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micronutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the most relevant, up-to-date science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship, the link between diet and cardiovascular disease, food-borne illnesses, food additives and weight control.\n",

We start with a positive approach by giving attention to people’s talents. We recognize that human existence involves constraints and difficulties, which is why this course is based on the idea of “existential” well-being.\nThis course will teach you how to live fully as a human being, in this body, on this planet, while at the same time being conscious that you are just a small part of a vast, incomprehensible, universe.\nOur experiential approach focuses on the innate wisdom of the human organism and our tendency to evolve in a forward-moving direction. You will learn how to become aware of this deeply felt knowledge by giving attention to your body as felt from the inside and to your emotions.\nOur person-centered approach encourages building optimal human relationships through empathy, respect and authenticity. These are complex skills, which we will bring within your reach by means of simple exercises.\nThrough examples, role-play and video-demonstrations we will illustrate how you can apply our existential well-being approach in a variety of helping contexts, including counseling and psychotherapy. You will develop skills to embody the existential well-being approach as a person and as a professional.\nYour learning will be enriched through exchanging thoughts and experiences with a diverse group of international participants. You will learn to notice how people from different cultures have different ideas about what it means to live well and meaningfully. You will engage in discussions where divergent values can be respectfully acknowledged. Your personal view of well-being will expand and deepen to a more universal perspective on what it means to be human.\nThis course is taught by instructors with decades of experience in existential psychotherapy, focusing -oriented and emotion-focused therapy, person-centered counseling and positive psychology.\nThe instructors are also teachers and researchers in the fields of psychotherapy, positive psychology, meaning and spirituality at KU Leuven, a prestigious European University.\nThis course offers you a high degree of flexibility. You can follow the content in sequence or choose to complete sections in order of interest to you. Be aware that it would be realistic to spend 6 to 8 hours on each section. The course will be available from October until the end of June and you can follow your own rhythm in studying and practicing what is offered in each section.\n",

    "description": "Are you an engineer, scientist or technician? Are you dealing with measurements or big data, but are you unsure about how to proceed? This is the course that teaches you how to find the best estimates of the unknown parameters from noisy observations. You will also learn how to assess the quality of your results.\nTU Delft’s approach to observation theory is world leading and based on decades of experience in research and teaching in geodesy and the wider geosciences. The theory, however, can be applied to all the engineering sciences where measurements are used to estimate unknown parameters.\nThe course introduces a standardized approach for parameter estimation, using a functional model (relating the observations to the unknown parameters) and a stochastic model (describing the quality of the observations). Using the concepts of least squares and best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE), parameters are estimated and analyzed in terms of precision and significance.\nThe course ends with the concept of overall model test, to check the validity of the parameter estimation results using hypothesis testing. Emphasis is given to develop a standardized way to deal with estimation problems. Most of the course effort will be on examples and exercises from different engineering disciplines, especially in the domain of Earth Sciences.\nThis course is aimed towards Engineering and Earth Sciences students at Bachelor’s, Master’s and postgraduate level.\n \nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered why ventilation helps to cool down your hot chocolate? Do you know why a surfing suit keeps you warm? Why iron feels cold, while wood feels warm at room temperature? Or how air is transferred into aqueous liquids in a water treatment plant? How can we sterilize milk with the least amount of energy? How does medicine spread in our tissue? Or how do we design a new cooling tower of a power plant? All these are phenomena that involve heat transfer, mass transfer or fluid flow. \nTransport Phenomena investigates such questions and many others, exploring a wide variety of applications ranging from industrial processes to environmental engineering, to transport processes in our own body and even simple daily life problems\r\n \r\nIn this course we will look into the underlying concepts of these processes, that often take place simultaneously, and will teach you how to apply them to a variety of real-life problems. You will learn how to model the processes and make quantitative statements.  \n\nFAQ\nIs there a book required for the course?\nThe course uses materials and software that are freely available online. A useful reference book is: Harry Van den Akker & Robert F. Mudde, Transport Phenomena (Delft Academic Press, 2014, ISBN: 978-90-6562-3584).\nI just want to learn the basics of Transport Phenomena (TP). Do I really need to spend 8 hours per week for 7 weeks?\nWe offer this course for everyone who wants to use TP in their education or professional life and for anyone who just has an interest in it. Each week we will give a short overview of the course elements and indicate how to take a ‘quick route’. You can decide how you want to go through this course, depending on the topic, your background and the time available. \nIf I miss a week, does that affect my performance?\nYou can study at your own pace as long as you finish before the final deadline. However, some assignments and discussions are primarily active and monitored during the scheduled period. \n \nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "We increasingly depend on reliable and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services to improve livability and facilitate economic development. However, today's infrastructure systems are drastically changing. They are becoming more and more web-based, interconnected and transnational, with increasingly fragmented public and private ownership, while new technologies are on their way. The capital need for investment in new infrastructures and upgrading of ageing infrastructures is tremendous.\nDuring this infrastructure course you will learn to examine these challenges from a new, combined engineering and social sciences perspective. Subsequently we will focus on the challenges that complex adaptive infrastructure systems pose for governance, management and decision-making in a world full of uncertainties. In the last part of the course, we will introduce a selection of topics and tools (modeling & simulation, value sensitive design, standards, ICT-architecture) which will help you to improve the adequacy of infrastructure systems and services, while dealing with the risks and vulnerabilities of infrastructure interdependencies.\nIn our case studies, we will focus on topical developments and policies, such as sustainable energy transition (including smart grids), urbanization and its impact on infrastructures, the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, and the phenomenon of inverse infrastructure development (self-organization).  \nIf you are interested or involved in the functioning of today's and tomorrow's infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional. You will be interacting with peers all over the world and we will present a large number of case studies.\nThe course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled 'Next Generation Infrastructures' (NGInfra).\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Did you know your best opportunities for growth may not lie solely in developing new “blockbuster” products or services? They may instead be found by focusing on your existing best customers — and finding new customers with similar behavioral tendencies. Created by Professor Peter Fader, a world-renowned thought leader on marketing analytics and co-founder of Zodiac, a predictive analytics solution built on the breakthrough consumer behavior models developed by Professor Fader, this marketing course is designed to help you identify your most valuable customers and maximize their strategic value.\nYou might have the data and the technology to track your best customers, but how can you meaningfully differentiate them from the rest? How do you align your operations around them? And how do you create and sustain competitive advantages from such practices? In this course, you’ll radically rethink how you develop and implement customer-centric strategies that you can apply to your existing customers today. You’ll also gain valuable insights into how to apply performance metrics and rethink product development processes in order to meet the needs of your most valuable customers.\n",

Tout au long du MOOC, vous aurez l’occasion d’appliquer la théorie à une étude de cas réel qui vous placera dans la peau d’un décideur marketing. Vous bénéficierez aussi d’interviews d’experts et d’échanges privilégiés et interactifs avec les professeurs lors de conférences en direct. \r\n \r\nTous les jours, consommez-vous des biens ou des services ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de saisir la logique du marketing et de devenir un consommateur plus responsable.\nEtes-vous un praticien non encore averti en marketing ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de comprendre le pourquoi des décisions du marketing opérationnel et de les mettre en œuvre dans un cas concret.\nEtes-vous étudiant et curieux ? Ce MOOC vous permettra de vous familiariser avec les pratiques du marketing, dans les secteurs marchands et non marchands.\r\n \r\nEtes-vous un étudiant en gestion ? Ce MOOC vous offrira un complément aux cours de stratégie et de marketing stratégique. Il vous permettra d’opérationnaliser les décisions dans quatre composantes classiques à savoir le produit, la distribution, le prix et la communication (les « 4 P »).\r\n \r\nQue vous soyez consommateur, praticien ou étudiant, ce MOOC vous offrira un regard éclairé sur l’éthique du marketing.\n\r\nAvec le partenariat des éditions Dunod pour l'ouvrage Lambin, J.-J., & de Moerloose, C. (2012). Marketing stratégique et opérationnel. Du marketing à l'orientation-marché (8ème édition).\r\n \n\nThis class will provide you with an overview of the various dimensions of operational marketing (marketing decisions). These decisions concern product development, setting of a price for this product, selecting one or several distribution channels and finally communication tools in order to promote this product. Of course, these decisions rest on conceptual concepts that we will also present. You will have the opportunity to concretely apply course content through weekly case studies for which you will play the role of a manager. This MOOC provides content through videos, quiz, expert interviews, a forum, discussion (hangouts) and additional readings.\r\n \r\nTo consumers, this class will offer you an understanding of the logic behind marketing and it will enable you to become a more aware and responsible consumer.\r\n \r\nTo practitioners with no marketing background, this MOOC will enable you to understand the reasoning behind marketing decisions and to apply this reasoning in real situations.\r\n \r\nTo students with no business background, this MOOC will help you to become familiar with marketing practices both in commercial and non-profit marketing and to understand and analyze important operational decisions in marketing.\r\n \r\nTo business students, this MOOC will be complementary to strategy and marketing strategy classes. It will enable you to operationalize decisions using the 4 ‘P’s’: Price, Product, Place and Promotion.\r\n \r\nTo everybody involved in this MOOC, the ethical issues in Marketing will be highlighted. \r\n \nCe cours est enseigné en français.

    "description": "En un lugar de la UAM, cuyo nombre merece recordar, habita la España de El Quijote. \n\r\nUn espacio en el que su monarquía creó el primer imperio global de la Historia. Un tiempo, entre los siglos XVI y XVII, en el que su sociedad alcanzó la excelencia en las artes y las letras.\n\r\nAunque ese esplendor se dio en plenos aires de cambio. Pues España pasó de la hegemonía a la decadencia, de la expansión a la crisis.\n\r\nEsta asignatura pretende trazar la historia de aquella época. Entre el Renacimiento y el Barroco su cultura marcó la pauta en Occidente. Las obras literarias -La Celestina, El Lazarillo, etc.- se tradujeron enseguida en las imprentas europeas y americanas. Las ropas marcaron la moda cortesana. La tendencia más fashion era “vestir a la española”. Los tratados militares y políticos fueron estudiados por los enemigos.\n\r\nLa acumulación de talentos en la Villa y Corte de Madrid (Cervantes, Lope, Velázquez, etc.), tuvo réplicas en las grandes ciudades de imperio. Pues en Sevilla, Lisboa, Barcelona, Nápoles, México o Lima se multiplicaron academias literarias, estrenos teatrales y fiestas. Una síntesis de pueblos unidos por la lealtad a la Corona y la fe católica.\n\r\nEn nuestro recorrido por esa España de El Quijote pasaremos de la campana al reloj y de la geografía fantástica a la real. La sociedad estuvo - Conocer la Historia de España en el Siglo de Oro a través de El Quijote como hilo conductor.\n\nAdentrarnos en la vida cotidiana de los siglos XVI y XVII a través de la sociedad y la cultura.\nOfrecer al alumnado las fuentes escritas y visuales para que contemple el tiempo de El Quijote como si viviese en él.\nComparar los valores de la España de El Quijote con los actuales para comprender cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo de la Historia polarizada entre los privilegiados -nobleza y clero- y los pobres y los picaros. El Humanismo fue cultivado en las universidades. La familia, la alimentación, la vivienda, los juegos y las fiestas, protagonizaron la vida cotidiana. \n\n\r\nEn el tiempo de El Quijote las luces de los genios literarios y artísticos brillaron sobre las sombras de la Inquisición. Viajemos, pues, a esta excelsa cultura del Siglo de Oro.\n",

We will discuss where these beliefs, theories and practices originated from, how they were passed on over the ages and why some are still so central to large communities of believers across the world today, whether it be amongst Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists or Shintoists.\nWe'll be dealing with everything from gods and spirits, to angels and demons, to afterlife and the netherworld, as well as the great cycles of the universe and the tremendous power of lunar and solar eclipses. The interpretation of dreams and all sorts of magic and miraculous deeds will also be covered during this course.\nStudents will have the opportunity to travel extensively in time and space. The comparative, critical and contextualized approach of this course will allow for a valuable and thought-provoking experience.\nWe are a course team of about twenty-five specialists working at, or in close interaction with, the Department of Greek, Latin and Oriental Studies (GLOR) at the University of Louvain. We are all historians or philologists, all passionate about our respective fields of expertise, and all fully determined to help you as much as we can as we progress through this course. Most of all, we're looking forward to \"meeting\" you and to having lively discussions with you on the forums.\nIf you're curious about the cultures of this world, past and present, this course is definitely for you.

    "description": "Souvent confinée à l’étude des techniques permettant de vendre une encyclopédie en 24 volumes à une octogénaire récalcitrante ou à l’art de marchander son salaire, la négociation est souvent abordée sous un angle exclusivement utilitariste. Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…\r\n \r\nCe cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.\r\n \nCe cours sera enseigné en français.\r\n \r\nOften confined to the study of techniques like selling a 24-volume encyclopedia to a recalcitrant octogenarian or to the art of haggling salary, negotiation is frequently approached from a purely utilitarian perspective. But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.\r\n \r\nThis course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who “look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,” we will explore how “imperfect beings behave in reality (Raïffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.\r\n \nThis course is taught in French.\n",

    "description": "Este curso se imparte en español con subtítulos en inglés, y tanto el material adicional como los ejercicios del curso se ofrecerán en español e inglés. / This course will be taught in Spanish with English subtitles; the required readings as well as the quizzes and other evaluation materials will be provided in both languages.\n\nDesde que en 1954 se realizara el primer trasplante exitoso de un órgano, la cirugía de trasplantes se ha desarrollado espectacularmente brindando esperanza y calidad de vida a muchos enfermos. Mientras esas técnicas y posibilidades terapéuticas avanzan, persisten sin embargo muchos interrogantes sobre el modo en el que los órganos pueden obtenerse lícitamente. Algunos de esos dilemas nos acompañan desde siempre, otros son suscitados por la aparición de fenómenos novedosos como el turismo de trasplantes, las posibilidades que ofrece la donación tras la muerte cardiocirculatoria o los descubrimientos sobre las funciones fisiológicas remanentes en los pacientes diagnosticados en muerte cerebral. En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?\n\r\nEn este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos\r\n \nThe first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs. \n",

Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer.\nThe premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don’t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can’t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on “hard fun.” This idea will be a central tenet of this course.\nThrough six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. For the course project, participants will create their own learning game. This course utilizes Gameblox, a game editor that uses a block based programming language to allow anyone to create games.\n",

Rather than learning about these subjects in the abstract, students will learn by engaging with local problems and issues in their communities. To achieve this, students will learn how to:\n\nDevelop an actionable central research question\nPropose a research project\nConduct primary and secondary research\nDesign an action-oriented research project for web publication\n\nProposing solutions to local problems requires grounding research in the local context and communicating clear solutions and calls for action that are understandable and relevant to local audiences.\nStudents will learn how to conduct research, write about a particular issue, and construct a call to action based upon their research.\nThis is a unique English course because students will directly learn about the power and pleasures of writing. By engaging with local questions and problems, students will have the opportunity to enter into important discussions and possibly create meaningful changes in the lives of those around them. Students will create a digital portfolio that enables them to publish and share their research and writing.\nThis course will interest individuals who want to learn more about how to create change in the world through research and writing. This class will also interest those who want to learn how to compose in a digital environment.\nIf you wish to earn university credit for the course, we will ask you to complete a portfolio in which you demonstrate what you have learned. Specifically, you will address what you have learned in the course and provide evidence that you have acquired the skills and knowledge taught during the course. Credit earned will count as ASU’s First-Year Composition course. However, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.\n",

    "description": "All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the second of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.\nThe 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.\nPart 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.\nPart 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.\nPart 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).\n",

Quel regard et quels types d’analyse l’anthropologie propose-t-elle sur les systèmes de parenté, symboliques, politiques, religieux ?\nL’anthropologie prospective nous aide à comprendre et à anticiper les phénomènes qui transforment nos modes de vie contemporains. Elle pose un regard transversal sur les actions, les pratiques et les dires des personnes avec lesquelles travaillent les chercheurs.\n« Entrer en anthropologie », c’est accepter de changer son regard sur le monde et de se décentrer par rapport à ses habitudes. Si vous désirez comprendre un peu mieux le monde et ses changements contemporains, suivez ces chercheurs sur leur terrain et expérimentez d’autres repères culturels.\nDurant ces quelques heures, vous serez amenés à débattre avec des professeurs et des étudiants autour de questions sur la famille, les migrations, les mondes virtuels ou encore les mondes des invisibles. Vous apprendrez les bases de l'approche anthropologique et ce qu'elle peut vous apporter en termes de réflexion sur votre propre société, sur votre vie et votre quotidienneté. Ce cours vous donne l’opportunité de comparer vos expériences et d’échanger vos points de vue avec des personnes d’autres horizons.\nLes six semaines de cours aborderont une série de thématiques illustrées par des exemples concrets de modes d’existence divers et disséminés sur le globe. Des enseignants plongés au cœur des pratiques sociales et des enjeux politiques et économiques les plus variés partageront avec vous leur expérience après des années d'immersion sur les terrains de recherche qui les passionnent.\nSi vous êtes curieux de tout et que comprendre votre propre société mais aussi des sociétés méconnues vous intéresse, ce cours s'adresse à vous !\n\nHow do human beings organize themselves in societies? What do we call “families” and how do they form? What type of analysis does anthropology propose about parenthood, and symbolic, political and religious systems?\nProspective anthropology helps us to understand and anticipate phenomena that transform our ways of life today. It gives a cross-cutting look at the actions, practices, and words of those people with whom anthropological researchers work.\nTo understand anthropology is to accept changing your view of the world, and to shift your perpsective of your own habits. If you want to understand the world and its contemporary changes more deeply, follow these researchers in their field, and experiment with other cultural references.\nIn this course, you will debate with professors and students about family, migrations, virtual worlds, and the world of « invisibles. » You will learn the basis of the anthropological approach and what it can bring you as a reflection tool about your own society and your everyday life. This course gives you the opportunity to compare your experiences and to exchange points of view with people from all around the world.\nProfessors immersed in the heart of various social practices, political and economic issues will share their experiences with you after years of research in fields that they are passionate about.\nIf you are curious about everything, and if you are interested in understanding your own society but also unknown societies, this course is for you!\n",

    "description": "Múltiples y diversas manifestaciones muestran que se están produciendo unos profundos cambios en el mundo. El modelo de la sociedad industrial está dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, aún difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la información en conocimiento es clave. Es fácil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educación bien distinto al que requería la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo difícilmente se podrá conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente.\nEl curso tiene dos objetivos. El primero es presentar el fenómeno de la transformación de la sociedad que estamos viviendo y los fundamentos para definir el mundo que está emergiendo como el de la sociedad del conocimiento.  La pretensión de la primera parte es disponer de un escenario suficientemente detallado y sólido de lo que está sucediendo y superar así la visión e interpretación triviales que pueda haber sobre un nuevo modelo de sociedad. Sin esta buena base es difícil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educación.\nEl objetivo de tratar la educación en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relación con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnológico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. Así que se tratará la estrecha relación que hay y debe haber entre educación y cultura. De igual modo se verá en el curso la relación entre tecnología y educación, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural.\nLa pretensión del curso es que de esta observación del fenómeno actual de  cambio, y de la interpretación del papel de la educación para la orientación y control de ese cambio, surjan elementos inspiradores de acciones educativas precisas ajustadas a las múltiples realidades concretas desde las que se están sintiendo los desafíos de vivir en el siglo XXI.\nEl planteamiento didáctico del curso seguirá la estructura de un viaje por el tiempo, por lugares y también por conceptos que haga ameno el recorrido durante las siete semanas. En cuanto a la parte textual, habrá la experiencia de lectura de piezas multimedia concebidas y escritas para la lectura en pantalla, y especialmente en smartphones y tabletas.\n",

Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.\nWe will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.\nThis is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.\nThis course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a Supply Chain Analytics Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos. \nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.

It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.\nLouv1.1x (Fundamentals) covers functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You’ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.\nLouv1.2x (Abstraction and Concurrency) covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You’ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You’ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.\nTo learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, watch the introductory video. \n",

Both courses provide a solid foundation in the area of reliable distributed computing, including the main concepts, results, models and algorithms in the field.\nIn order to ensure that IT infrastructures - a key engine of operations for any organization - operate at full capacity and efficiency, it is vital to understand its core: distributed algorithms. To achieve this, the infrastructure itself must be reliable and resilient. This course continues on the foundations of distributed algorithms, introduced in ID2203.1x, and builds on these concepts at a higher level of complexity to develop the skills needed to build and maintain reliable and efficient distributed systems.\nID2203.2x covers specific advanced abstractions and algorithms including sequence consensus and multi-Paxos; atomic broadcast and replicated state machines. It also covers dynamic reconfiguration of services; the use of physical clocks in distributed systems; the CAP theorem, and weaker consistency models, including eventual consistency and conflict-free replicated data-types.\nStudents will experiment and develop a variety of distributed algorithms in an interactive, engaging programming environment using the Scala programming language. They will be guided throughout the programming assignments and provided with intuitive examples to help them get started.\nTo complete the course with a full grade (100%) students are required to answer the graded quizzes provided every week, as well as the programming assignments.\n",

This course is the third of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.\nThe 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.\nPart 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).\n",

    "description": "There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.\nUnfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.\nWe will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.\nWe will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.\nFinally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.\nThis course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a Supply Chain Technology & Systems Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos. \nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations.\n",

We will also look at how businesses make economic decisions such as how many workers to hire and how many machines and buildings to use to produce their products.\nIn the second half of the course, we consider how different policies can potentially enhance or distort market outcomes by offsetting, alleviating, or amplifying these inefficiencies. Our focus will be on five aspects of economic policy:\n\nlabor market policies and unemployment\nR&D and innovation policies\nfiscal policies and taxation\nmonetary policy and inflation \nfree-trade policies\n\nThis course satisfies the Social-Behavioral Sciences (SB) general studies requirement at Arizona State University.

What is the religious and political context into which they emerged? How were they first interpreted? How and why do they make such an enormous impact in Christian communities and in politics today?\nArchaeological materials and ancient writings will help you to enter the ancient Mediterranean world and to think about religious groups, power, poverty, health, and the lives of elites and slaves in the Roman Empire. We’ll explore how immediately controversial these letters were, and how these letters are used today to debate relations between Christians and Jews; issues such as love, law, and grace; and topics such as charismatic Christianity, homosexuality, and women’s religious leadership.\r\n \r\nWhether you’ve been studying Paul’s letters for years or are merely curious about what Christian scriptures are, this course will provide you with information to deepen your understanding of the ancient contexts and present-day controversies about these texts.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

    "description": "Actuary is rated the best job of 2015 by CareerCast.com because it pays well and offers abundant opportunities for advancement. \nYou may have heard of actuarial science, or you might even know an actuary, but do you know what an actuary does? During the course you’ll hear from a wide variety of actuaries about their careers.\nAnd don’t be scared that the course will be “just a whole lot of mathematics”. Together, we will go beyond the math to learn how actuaries approach problems relating to risk, using examples from:\n\nFinance\nInvestments\nBanking\nInsurance\n\nYou will learn how actuarial science applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in these industries and other professions.\nYou’ll experience “hands-on” learning using Excel (or an equivalent spreadsheet tool) to project and investigate the financial condition of a company choosing appropriate strategies for the company through the use of simulations.\nThe course has been carefully designed for students from a wide variety of backgrounds, with secondary/high school level being the only assumption of mathematical background. Even if you don’t have any background in, for example, calculus, the course has been designed so you can skip over these sections without affecting your understanding of the rest of the course. You also do not need to have any Excel or other spreadsheet background to take the course.\nFor those with stronger mathematical backgrounds, extension questions are provided to test you further. You’ll learn a huge amount about actuarial science no matter what your background is!\nJoin us today. To connect with the course community before and during the course, join our Facebook group, and tweet us with #actuarialedX.\n\"Great introduction to this specialized field; every day there are new challenges where as a student you are put in a situation to learn and apply the lessons with practical exercises.

    "description": "This orientation course is meant to introduce learners, teachers, and higher education leaders to the Global Freshman Academy (GFA). We recommend you browse the course to learn about GFA, its mission, how it works, the courses that will be available over the coming months, and the outcomes we hope to provide to our learners. Click \"See more\" to view frequently asked questions.\nFAQ\nIs Financial Aid Available?\r\nWe are pursuing options to make financial aid available, but at this time it is not available to GFA students.\nCan I receive university credit for courses via GFA even if I have not received my high school diploma or passed the high school equivalency exam?\r\nAnyone can take these courses for ASU credit. However, if you’d like to apply them toward a university degree, you will most likely need your high school diploma or proof that you’ve passed the high school equivalency exam. This will also depend on the policies of the particular university to which you are applying.\nIs GFA for Freshman only?\r\nNo. While GFA is perfect for incoming Freshman who want to enjoy a flexible, economically-viable model for taking Freshman-level courses, ambitious high school students who want a jump-start for their college career, or adult-learners returning to Freshman year after a hiatus, these introductory-level courses can be taken by anyone who wants to continue lifelong learning or by educators who want to share resources with students.\nWill GFA be extended to full college degrees?\r\nAt this time, edX and ASU are focused on breaking down the barriers to successfully completing Freshman year.\nWill I get a letter grade on my Verified Certificate? \r\nNo. Your Verified Certificate is provided by edX to any student who completes an ID Verified course with a passing score (which varies, but will be clearly communicated via course materials) and will not feature a letter grade. Additionally, your Verified Certificate does not equal credit earned by ASU and you will still need to complete the steps required for credit conversion after you have earned the Verified Certificate.\nWill I get a letter grade on my Arizona State University transcript?\r\nYes students who pursue the ID Verified track will receive a letter grade from ASU for the course and an official Arizona State University transcript if they pay the credit fee.\nWhy is the estimated effort (18 hours per week) for these courses so high? \r\nAs a tier-1 public research university, ASU courses reflect the rigorous standards faculty members expect of their students. Given this, ASU recommends that for a 7.5 week course, students should be prepared to spend 6 hours a week on coursework for every 1 course credit. So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week.\nTo what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree?\r\nArizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed.\nWill Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities?\r\nUniversity credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted.\nAfter having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU?\r\nYou will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course.\nHow will exam proctoring work?\r\nStudents who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams.\nWill GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams?\r\nedX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video.\nWhat is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy?\r\nTo see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course.\nIf I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript? \r\nIf you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript.\nIf I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost? \r\nWith the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee.\nIf I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit? \r\nAt this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit.\nWill you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc.\r\nThe Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements. The general studies focus areas will include Mathematical Studies, English, Humanities, Arts and Design, Social-Behavioral Sciences and Natural Sciences. To see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the Future GFA Courses section of the Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course.\nHow do I transfer the credits that I might earn through GFA?\r\nOnce you complete your course(s) and are ready to transfer the credit earned, you will simply request your official transcript from ASU and submit to the the university to which you are applying.\nI have previously earned credits from other universities. Can I still take courses through GFA?\r\nWe would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.\n",

Perhaps there are no more salient topics in the information age and the global economy than a comprehensive understanding of how learning takes place and what predicts and determines human behavior. The course is a primer, meant to provide substantive content through which to understand the human condition and to inspire students to continue their learning and growth.\r\n \r\nStudents interested in the study of psychology are interested in why people do, say and think what they do. They have questions about how learning takes place, how genetics dictate certain traits but not others, how memories are formed, where to draw the line between normality and disorder, whether a damaged brain can regain function and the predictors of addiction.\r\n \r\nThrough this introductory course, students will have the opportunity to understand the science of psychology and how psychologists measure mental function and behavior and how the results are reported. They will better understand perception and consciousness and the mysteries of sleep and dreams. Through child development, they will understand how the brain is ready for learning and pre-wired for language. Motivation, cognition and personality will be analyzed through the lens of past and current psychological thought. Students will understand the statistical reality of the normal distribution and how that is relevant to most traits. They will review new research on the plasticity of the brain and consider whether intelligence is fixed or flexible. Lastly, the array of disorders and dysfunction will be analyzed and discussed and the line between normal and abnormal will be considered.\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n",

    "description": "Join Professor Eric Lander and the MITx Biology team in a newly restructured introductory biology learning experience. All original 7.00x course materials are available here for exploration and completion, including video and interactive problem sets and exams. Despite the current lack of a certification option, we strongly encourage you to work through the activities, towards a goal of learning biology, with an eye towards future certification options. In this version of the course, we have kept the course content the same while optimizing the course settings for learning: instant feedback after trying problems and all content available at all times. Starting soon, we will offer a more thorough and robust means of certifying edX learners in their mastery of the MITx introductory biology content, through a new competency exam. This exciting new option is still under development, but as soon as we confirm the timing and technical details of the exam, we will notify you of the option to switch to verified certificate track. In the meantime, we highly recommend preparing for the coming competency exam certification by using the current course materials and MIT OpenCourseWare problems. More details to come – stay tuned!\n7.00x is an introductory level biology course hosted by professor Eric Lander, who was one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project. The course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a learner, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alter their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.\n7.00x – The Secret of Life will let you explore the mysteries of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology and genomics, and rational medicine.

Start by learning R Statistics!\nSkilled professionals who can process and analyze data are in great demand today. In this course you will explore concepts in statistics to make sense out of data. You will learn the practical skills necessary to find, import, analyze and visualize data. We will take a look under the hood of statistics and equip you with broad tools for understanding statistical inference and statistical methods. You will also perform some really complicated calculations and visualizations, following in the footsteps of Karolinska Institute’s researchers.\nStatistical programming is an essential skill in our golden age of data abundance. Health science has become a field of big data, just like so many other fields of study. New techniques make it possible and affordable to generate massive data sets in biology. Researchers and clinicians can measure the activity for each of 30000 genes of a patient. They can read the complete genome sequence of a patient. Thanks to another trend of the decade, open access publishing, the results of such large scale health science are very often published for you to read free of charge. You can even access the raw data from open databases such as the gene expression database of the NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information.\nWe will dive into this data together. Learn how to use R, a powerful open source statistical programming language, and see why it has become the tool of choice in many industries in this introductory R statistics course. \n",

    "description": "EE40LX teaches the fundamentals of engineering electronic interfaces between the physical world and digital devices. Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like!\nUseful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course. The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX.\nAdditionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter.\nCreativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience.\nMyDAQ Information\r\nThose who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. If you are interested, take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page: http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.html\n\nParts Kit Information\r\nThe parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page, which can be found here: http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging\n\r\nA detailed bill of materials with more information can be found here: courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf\nWhat is the format of the class?\r\nThe class consists of eight modules. Every module consists of a combination of theory-based lectures and lab-based discussions where we apply that module’s theory to building a part of a robot. Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class.\nIs this class taught at UC Berkeley?\r\nThis class is part of the laboratory component of \"EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems,\" the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format.\nWhat will the robot do?\r\nThe bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal.\nWhat supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course?\r\nIn order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary.\nThe NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store.\nHow much does the kit cost?\r\nThe parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects.\nWill I need to know how to program?\r\nSample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project.\nWill this course cover microcontroller programming?\r\nNo. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer to UT Austinx’s Embedded Systems course.\nWhat if I already have a microcontroller?\r\nSince analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs.\nIs there a required textbook?\r\nNo textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2nd edition of the book Circuits by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.\n",

    "description": "Do you love printed paper and wonder how much longer it will survive in the age of ebooks? Are you curious about how the mass-produced modern book emerged in the first place?  Come behind the scenes in Harvard’s libraries to explore the look, feel and even smell of nineteenth-century British and American books in this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.\nIn 19th-century Britain and America, schooling expanded, paper cheapened, and new technologies allowed print to reach wider audiences than ever before.  After the rare and beautiful manuscripts and books showcased by earlier modules, the mass-produced, disposable objects that survive from the nineteenth century bear witness to the rise of the reading public.\nThis module investigates what scholars know about nineteenth-century reading, as well as how they know it.\nThis module’s six sections guide you through underlined, inscribed, defaced and repaired books in Harvard’s collections:\n1. Name That Book\r\nFind out what you can tell about a book when you’re blindfolded.\n2. Handheld Books and Mobile Readers\r\nWhat book did one soldier carry to Civil War battlefields in his pocket? (Hint: it’s not what you think.)\n3. The Pen and the Needle\r\nDid 19th-century girls have to choose between sewing and reading?  The holes pricked in one book suggest they did both at once.\n4. Leaving your Mark\r\nLuckily for future historians, these children didn’t listen when people told them not to write in their books.\n5. Detective Work\r\nTry out some tools that build on what you’ve learned about books at Harvard to discover the stories hidden in your local library.\n6. Over to You\r\nYour chance to share what you have found in the books around you.\nJoin us, and discover how people in the first information age read, underlined, and repaired the pages that they treasured. \n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "When we think of liturgy today, we imagine short, formal, congregational events happening periodically within the confines of churches. Medieval liturgy, however, took up many hours of every day, filled the city's largest meeting halls, and even spilled onto the streets. At the center of the medieval liturgy were the books we will study in this course.\nIn this module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space, we’ll explore and explain the beautiful service books of the medieval church. No prior knowledge of liturgy or Latin is required, but there will be a lot of both, along with music.\nThe medieval services consisted of a complex system of cycles, and the liturgical books correspond to the various functions of the people who used them: Laypersons, nuns and monks, readers, singers, priests, and bishops.\nWe will explore and examine these precious objects using materials from Harvard’s collections. Close examination of various types of books will help to explain the complex and collaborative nature of medieval worship. Ultimately, we will learn how these beautifully adorned books  represent the importance of liturgy as an essential function of society in the Middle Ages.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "As books “go digital,” we can appreciate what is gained in terms of convenience, accessibility and interconnectedness. However, we should also consider what is lost as texts transition to a digital sphere.\nThis module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space seeks to re-introduce learners to the codex – a handwritten and hand-constructed book - as a three-dimensional object whose characteristics produce meaning in the experience of the reader.\nThis module is designed to walk you through the process of making a medieval manuscript. Using a wide variety of examples from the collections of Harvard’s Houghton Library, it will familiarize you with basic terms and concepts and give you a “feel” for the shapes, sizes, formats, materials and considerations of craft that went into the making of the book as we know it.\nThroughout the Middle Ages there existed an intimate relationship between making and meaning. Codices were tactile as well as visual objects designed to engage multiple senses. In the illuminated manuscript, it is often impossible to distinguish neatly between text and image; rather, letters assume imagistic forms and images take the form of letters.\nBookmakers were sensitive to the interplay of materials, from the parchment of the pages to the wooden boards, designed to protect the contents. Each of these elements conditioned a reader’s interaction with the book. Bookmaking required a significant material investment. The production process was laborious and lengthy, involving many separate stages and craftsmen.\nBooks participated in a wide range of ritual, liturgical, devotional, educational and practical contexts, each of which in turn conditioned the presentation and reception of both their form and content.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "Medieval Europe has preserved enormous quantities of books and documents—many millions of pages, in fact—written in Latin and other languages. However, only a tiny percentage of these texts have been edited and published. To gain access to the rest, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting,\nThis module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space introduces students to the world of medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting. This particular module focuses on notarial handwriting from the city of Marseille in the 14th and 15th centuries. The module features household inventories, which identify some of the fascinating objects found in people’s houses. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move from letter-group to letter-group. In addition to learning the handwriting, we will take special care to explore some of the many abbreviations and other elements of the secular registers of the later Middle Ages.\nSome knowledge of Latin or another Romance Language will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without these language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore medieval handiwork.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "Thousands upon thousands of manuscripts written in Latin and other languages remain from the 12th century, when Western Europe saw an unprecedented increase in manuscript production. Of these manuscripts from the middle ages, only a small percentage have been identified, much less edited and published. To explore these fascinating texts, you need to learn the art and science of reading medieval handwriting.\nThis module of The Book: Histories Across Space and Time introduces students to medieval paleography, the science of reading old handwriting, with a focus on the era of the 12th century. By studying a representative hand in depth, you will learn to read 12th century Transitional Gothic script and decipher the abbreviations that set the pattern of writing for the following centuries before print. We will work with selected manuscripts from Harvard’s Houghton library and enter into the cultural world of the 12th century monasteries and schools. Assessments and quizzes will allow you to track your progress as you move through letter forms and abbreviations to read whole blocks of text.\nSome knowledge of Latin will be very helpful for understanding the texts you will read, but students without the necessary language skills will still enjoy this chance to explore 12th century hands.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "Printing, or the capacity to reproduce text and image mechanically, has rightly been hailed as a technology with far-reaching impact. But the technology takes more than one form and originated in more than one historical context.\nIn this module of The Book: Histories Across Space and Time, you will learn how early printed books in mid-fifteenth century Europe were first modeled on medieval manuscripts, but soon developed new conventions that remain familiar to us today. This module also explores printing in East Asia, by wood block and movable type, and the late dominance of manuscript production in the Islamic world. \nIn the first units of this module we compare and contrast manuscripts and printed books produced mainly in Europe from 1470-1700, looking at continuities and differences in layout, format, and the methods, materials, and economics of production. We also discuss examples of illustrated books and of handwritten annotations in books, including marginal annotations by readers and the marks of censors.\nTwo shorter units in this module focus on printing in East Asia, especially China, to highlight the features of woodblock printing which was common there, and on the Middle East, especially the Ottoman context, where a vibrant manuscript culture remained dominant until 1800. Taken together, this module gives an overview of three different contexts and technologies of book production before 1800.\nEach unit features rare manuscripts and printed books in the Harvard Libraries, which viewers can investigate in more depth within the courseware and on their own.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the making and use of scrolls in the European Middle Ages. The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which \naccount for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.\nThis module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making:\n\nScrolls of indeterminate length\nScrolls in long format\nCeremonial and archaizing scrolls\nPortable scrolls\n\nScrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University’s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard’s special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard’s Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art web application developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.\nThis is a module in the series The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "This module of The Book: Histories Across Time and Space focuses on the physical qualities of books, the role of books in 17th and 18th century France, and the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture.\nWe will focus on the importance of books as physical objects and the raw material of literature--namely, paper.  By considering the nature of paper and how it was made during the early modern period--from Gutenberg's time to the early nineteenth century--we can begin to understand the character of books and the way they worked.\nThis module also examines how books fit into the legal and political system of France under the Old Regime during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the French set standards imitated throughout Europe.  Before modern copyright, legal books had privileges, granted by the king, which provided a guarantee of quality as well as certification of   orthodoxy.  To qualify for a privilege, books had to be approved by censors.  Uncensored books, including most of the works of the Enlightenment, were usually produced outside France and circulated in the kingdom through a vast underground distribution system. \nIn addition, this module addresses the emergence of literature as a modern form of culture, which can be studied best in eighteenth-century England.  The first copyright law (1710), a high rate of literacy, a booming consumer market, a precocious periodical industry, and entrepreneurial publishing concentrated in London led to the development of a new kind of author--the independent writer. Samuel Johnson epitomized this new phenomenon. This module will allow you to get a close look at him and everything he represented by providing access to the Hyde Collection of Johnson's books and papers in Houghton Library at Harvard.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "This mini-course seeks to answer the following question: How did a school system, once the envy of the world, stumble so that the performance in math, science, and reading of U.S. students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world’s industrialized nations?\nExploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces—the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy. We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.\nIn the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches. These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2016.\nEach mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos.

Should we blame the schools or hold the students themselves accountable? Who determines the standards for accountability – the federal government or the individual states?\nThe demand for accountability in U.S. education resulted in No Child Left Behind and has shaped the Common Core debate. Throughout this mini-course, we will trace the origins of the accountability movement, the increased role of the federal government, the design of accountability interventions, and the impact of accountability programs on student performance.\nThis mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos.

    "description": "This mini-course focuses on alternatives to public schools in the United States.\nThere has been a rapid expansion of school choice in U.S. education. Charter schools now serve over five percent of the public school population, voucher programs have been introduced in many states, and digital education has captured the attention of educators across the country. What is the theoretical basis for these innovations? How effective are the early initiatives? How do parents decide what is best for their children? And how do all of these options affect the students who remain in traditional public schools?\nWith the help of several scholars and participants in these new ventures, we will discuss the ways in which these school choice initiatives are re-shaping U. S. education.\nThis mini-course contains five lectures, with most lectures divided into three videos. The mini-courses also includes assigned readings, discussion forums, and assessments.\nThis is the fourth mini-course in a four-course sequence.\n\nMini-Course 1: History and Politics of U.S. Education\nMini-Course 2: Teacher Policies\nMini-Course 3: Accountability and National Standards\nMini-Course 4: School Choice\n\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

The monumental symphony’s size and complexity stretches traditional instrumental forms to the breaking point, and its famous choral finale changed our view of orchestral music forever.\nHarvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through all four movements of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting aspects of symphonic form, describing Beethoven’s composition process, the rehearsals and premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today.\nYou will learn the basics of musical form and analysis, the genres and styles used and the circumstances of this symphony’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.\nAdditional First Nights Modules:\nFirst Nights: Handel’s Messiah and Baroque Oratorio\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations. Enrollees who are taking HarvardX courses as part of another program will also be governed by the academic policies of those programs.\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach people from all walks of life how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical – students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on a global level.\r\n\r\nThis course equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to produce solution-based journalism – stories that give equal weight to problems and solutions. Throughout the course, students will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this course provides students with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel their own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises or poverty. Early on, students will share their interest areas with their classmates and start to share information and ideas. Students will then produce Final Stories on their topics of interest.\r\n\r\nStudent work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face.\r\n\r\nWith that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.",

What do these icons represent in a global context?\nRights and Liberties – from the Declaration of Independence to the Greensboro Lunch Counter, how have Americans defined, and continue to define, their rights and governance?\nAmerica the Beautiful – From evidence of the continent’s first inhabitants to the conservation efforts of the Smithsonian’s scientists, how have the American people – both native and settler – envisioned, explored, worked and protected the land and its resources?\nSpirit of Invention – from the Model T to the space program, how have America’s pioneering inventions changed the world?\n\nIn this course you will gain a unique perspective on American history and culture by learning the stories behind objects that were, and continue to be, an essential part of U.S. history. Most importantly, you will reflect on what objects have personal meaning to you, and the role that symbolic objects play in your own histories.\nThis course is adapted from the video lecture series produced by Smithsonian and The Great Courses, Experiencing America: A Smithsonian Tour Through History.\n",

In this course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with virtual patient interactions will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self¬-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your own life.\nTo help people who need to improve their health by changing their behaviors, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following sections will focus on coping with stress, improving sleep, increasing physical activity and everyday behaviors like hand washing, safer sex and minimizing risky alcohol use.\nTo complete this course, you will need to spend a total of about 30-40 hours. This time covers course videos, follow-up questions to help you remember what you have learned, course reading (mostly open access scientific articles) and homework tasks. Part of the work is for you to do on your own, and part will be together with other participants in the course community.\n",

    "description": "The idea behind topological systems is simple: if there exists a quantity, which cannot change in an insulating system where all the particles are localized, then the system must become conducting and obtain propagating particles when the quantity (called a \"topological invariant\") finally changes.\nThe practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before.\nWhat will you gain from this course?\n\nLearn about the variety of subtopics in topological materials, their relation to each other and to the general principles.\nLearn to follow active research on topology, and critically understand it on your own.\nAcquire skills required to engage in research on your own, and to minimize confusion that often arises even among experienced researchers.\n\nWhat is the focus of this course?\n\nApplications of topology in condensed matter based on bulk-edge correspondence.\nSpecial attention to the most active research topics in topological condensed matter: theory of topological insulators and Majorana fermions, topological classification of \"grand ten” symmetry classes, and topological quantum computation\nExtensions of topology to further areas of condensed matter, such as photonic and mechanical systems, topological quantum walks, topology in fractionalized systems, driven or dissipative systems.\n\nWhat tools does this course use?\n\nSimple thought experiments that rely on considerations of symmetry or continuity under adiabatic deformations\nComputer simulations similar to those used in actual research will give a more detailed and visual understanding of the involved concepts\nDissecting research papers that teaches you to simply understand the idea even in the rather involved ones.\n\nThis course is a joint effort of Delft University of Technology, QuTech, NanoFront, University of Maryland, and Joint Quantum Institute.\nFAQs\nAre there any books that are required for the course?\nNo, the course will only rely on materials and software freely available online.\nIs it possible to get credit for this course at my university?\nNot by default, but we invite anyone to use the course materials as a basis for a graduate course, with course materials studied as preparation and followed by a classroom discussion. Such courses are planned at universities of Copenhagen, Delft, Leiden, and University of Maryland. Following such a course will obviously give you credit points.\nWould it not be better to take a more formal approach, and to describe the math in a more rigorous and systematic way?\nWhile advanced math is certainly relevant for some researchers, in our experience it is the simple things that are the most confusing. We aim for the course to stay accessible and relevant to advanced undergraduate/beginner graduate students, both the theorists and experimentalists.\nI do not know enough about condensed matter physics, but I have attended an exciting talk/read a cool article, and I'd like to learn more. Would the course be useful for me?\nWe are not sure. On the one hand, we will aim the course at people familiar with basic condensed matter physics and the necessary math, hence we will always assume that we don't need to explain e.g. band structures from scratch. However, a good share of the course materials are just discussions which would give you some sort of overview and understanding what this is all about.\nWhy didn't you discuss my favorite topic, which is certainly relevant and exciting?\nHey, that's a great idea! We aim to start from covering the basic questions, and then let the course evolve together with the field. So if you want, please help us by preparing the materials that would be helpful for the course, and they will become a bonus topic. By the way, same holds if you spot an error, or know how to improve the course: everything about this course is open, so don't hesitate to contribute.\nLICENSE\r\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Is a good, solid argument enough to make an impact? How would you disprove the stance that man-made global warming is just an “opinion”? How would you explain your opinion on school tests, budget cuts, crime, immigration, safety and security issues?  No doubt that your persuasiveness relies on your arguments. But your ability to influence and convince critically depends on the way you frame your message.\nIn today’s world, you often need to reduce a complex reality to a concise and convincing message. Framing is an approach that deals with the way we convey our message: our words, images, and metaphors. To take one basic characteristic, a good frame engages the listeners’ values and emotions – it is easy to remember and it is something that people will usually agree with intuitively.\nWhen you enter into a debate, you might be faced with frames of your opponents – and you will have to reframe the debate. This game of framing and reframing makes the debate to look like a chessboard made out of words. Of course, politicians play this game, trying to pull the debate towards their own words and metaphors in order to win their audience. But the game can be found everywhere: in the world of business, science, media – even at home.\nWe invite you to join our journey of learning the game of framing and reframing. You will discover how this game is played, and how you can play it yourself. \nThis course suits people who are engaged with and interested in public and political debates. Not only people from the public sector will find it useful, but also engineers, consultants, managers and anyone who wants to make an impact in discussions and debates.\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nCredits banner\nPhoto Obama by NASA CC BY-NC\nPhoto Thatcher by British Wallpaper CC BY-NC-SA\n",

Nous allons aborder tout d'abord les propriétés physiques des fluides : les états de la matière et la notion de viscosité. Un chapitre sera dédié à la tension de surface et à la capillarité. Nous introduirons ensuite le concept de similitude et l’utilisation des nombres adimensionnels. Nous allons alors considérer la statique des fluides à travers la loi de l'hydrostatique. La dynamique des fluides sera abordée en premier lieu par la cinématique. Ensuite, nous traiterons des équations de bilan avec notamment une application du théorème de conservation de l’énergie cinétique : le théorème de Bernoulli. Dans le dernier, nous montrerons que ce théorème relativement simple permet d’expliquer et de calculer des écoulements tels que ceux observés dans les rivières. Les vidéos du cours seront enrichies de vidéos d’expériences qui illustreront les concepts clés et par des quiz pour tester votre intuition et vos connaissances. Le dernier module vous permettra de piloter à distance une expérience d'hydraulique qui a lieu dans les laboratoires de l'EPFL.\nThis course is presented in French. \n",

    "description": "For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.\nAs the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.\nIn this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!\nAfter we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.\n",

    "description": "A flow is called hypersonic if the Mach number is greater than 5. This means that the flow speed is more than five times the speed of sound. In air at room temperature, the speed of sound is around 340 m/s, so a Mach 5 flow would have a flow speed of 1.7 km/s or just over 6,000 km/h. When a rocket launches a satellite into earth orbit, when a probe enters the atmosphere of another planet or when an aircraft is propelled by a supersonic combustion ramjet engine (a scramjet), hypersonic flows are encountered. Hypersonics – from Shock Waves to Scramjets introduces the basic concepts associated with flight at speeds greater than Mach 5 and takes students to the stage where they can analyse the performance of a scramjet engine that might be used in a future access-to-space system.\n",

    "description": "The discovery of exoplanets is one of the greatest revolutions in modern astrophysics. Twenty years ago, we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not.\nToday, things are totally different. Over 1,000 planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars, cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star, planets made of diamond, planets with rain made of glass, super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course, we’ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets, and how this research has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own.\nThis course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level mathematics and physics to get the most out of this course.\nThis is the second of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program. It follows on from the introductory course on the Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe, and is followed by courses on the violent universe and on cosmology.

The function of the brain is to govern behavior, and the aim of this course is to causally link biophysical mechanisms with simple behaviors studied in mice. The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks. The first goal of the course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain, its synapses and neurons. The second goal is to understand neuronal networks, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The third goal is to place neuronal network function in the context of sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioral decisions and motor output.\n",

    "description": "The origin of dogs is shrouded in mystery. In this course, you will learn how to interpret the often contradictory ideas about how, why, where and when dogs arose.\nGeneticists, archaeologists, anthropologists and behavioral scientists offer a variety of often opposing ideas about how dogs—the first domesticated species—arose. Some place the origin of dogs over 100,000 years ago; others place the start of dogs just 12,000 years ago. Claims for the location of the origin of dogs range from China to Europe and many places in between. Diverse scholars have suggested dogs arose as trash scavengers or as hunters’ helpers.\nThis course will provide you with the tools you need to find your own way through the confusing claims about the origin of dogs.\nThis course is part of the Dog Behavior and Cognition XSeries. \nNo previous knowledge of any of the sciences contributing to the origins of dogs is assumed.

This practical approach will help you channel your creativity so that you can program well in any language.\nSPD1 presents the core design method with a focus on simple data. You will learn techniques that help you develop your program requirements; how to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later; and how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive program. The final project is an interactive game.\nThis course is part of the How to Code - Systematic Program Design XSeries Program: \n\nHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 2\nHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 3\n\n",

Then we focus on the two main measurement technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. We then move on to describing how raw data and experimental information are imported into R and how we use Bioconductor classes to organize these data, whether generated locally, or harvested from public repositories or institutional archives. Genomic features are generally identified using intervals in genomic coordinates, and highly efficient algorithms for computing with genomic intervals will be examined in detail. Statistical methods for testing gene-centric or pathway-centric hypotheses with genome-scale data are found in packages such as limma, some of these techniques will be illustrated in lectures and labs.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

With R, it is very easy to obtain faster turnaround times for analyses by distributing tasks among the cores for concurrent execution. We will discuss how to use Bioconductor to simplify parallel computing for efficient, fault-tolerant, and reproducible high-performance analyses. This will be illustrated with common multicore architectures and Amazon’s EC2 infrastructure.  \nEnhanced interactivity: New approaches to programming with R and Bioconductor allow researchers to use the web browser as a highly dynamic interface for data interrogation and visualization. We will discuss how to create interactive reports that enable us to move beyond static tables and one-off graphics so that our analysis outputs can be transformed and explored in real time.\nEnhanced reproducibility: New methods of virtualization of software environments, exemplified by the Docker ecosystem, are useful for achieving reproducible distributed analyses. The Docker Hub includes a considerable number of container images useful for important Bioconductor-based workflows, and we will illustrate how to use and extend these for sharable and reproducible analysis.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level: inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples.

    "description": "Learn about contracts from Harvard Law Professor Charles Fried, one of the world’s leading authorities on contract law. Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal?\n\r\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life — agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.\n\r\nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties. \n\r\nThe course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

If you are not familiar with the C# programming language, it is recommended that you visit this Programming with C# course to learn the fundamentals of the language before proceeding through this course.\nXamarin.Forms takes code sharing to the next level by allowing you to share not just your application logic in a cross-platform fashion, but also the UI definition. Unlike other technologies, applications that rely on the Xamarin.Forms framework are 100% completely native applications that look and feel natural on each platform.\nWith Xamarin.Forms, you can write your application code once, and then build a native application that utilizes that code to run on almost any iOS, Android or Windows device including Windows 10. Your business logic can be written in C# (or any other .NET capable language) and your UI can either be defined in code, or in the XAML markup language.\n",

    "description": "Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.\nThe only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.\n",

    "description": "How can we get people to save more money, eat healthy foods, engage in healthy behaviors, and make better choices in general? There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice.\nIn three modules, learners will be able to a). explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b). learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c). design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.\nUnderstanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioral economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral research. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.\nYou will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “what strategy is better for improving welfare – nudging or education?” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioral economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.\nSeveral leading scholars, policy makers, business people, authors and commentators will briefly join our debate and discussion sections. These guest lecturers include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University), Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado), Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group), Owain Service (Behavioural Insights Team, UK Cabinet Office), Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author – The Hidden Brain), Professors Andrew Ching, Avi Goldfarb, Nina Mazar, and Claire Tsai, Min Zhao (University of Toronto) and many others!\n",

But the history of rocket development actually can be traced back more than 2,000 years to the experiments of Archytas, an ancient Greek Philosopher.\nThis aerospace history course will take you back in time and trace the many developments in technology that transformed rockets from celebratory accouterments to weapons and finally to launchpads for human space travel. It is a story of technology, but ultimately the emphasis on this course is about people. Some are very well-known, but others not so.\nYou will learn how the Chinese introduced rockets as weapons, how early experimenters succeeded through trial and error, how scientific advancement provided the foundation for rocket development and space travel, and how rocket use spread throughout the world prior to the modern era. Finally, you will be introduced to the contributions of rocket pioneers such as Tsiolkovsky, Oberth and Goddard who dreamed of and paved the way for space travel. The course culminates with an introduction of German rocket development in the early 1930s and the emergence the genius rocket engineer Wehner von Braun.  \nVerified students are eligible to earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and Professional Development Hours (PDHs), valid toward continuing education requirements for many professional certifications.\n",

    "description": "Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.\nAccording to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today’s world.\nThis course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.\nAt the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.\nThanks to the wonderful feedback of last year’s students, the course has been further improved.\r\nFollow us on Twitter @CRMooc for updates and hints about the course.\nFAQs\nWhat is the estimated effort for course?\nThe total effort is 48 hours. You can decide for yourself when you will work on the course.\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\nNothing! The course is free.\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\nYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.\nIs this course related to campus courses of Delft University of Technology?\nYes, this course can be seen as an evolution of the WI3421TU Risk Management course, a compulsory course of the Minor Finance at TU Delft.\n",

    "description": "Knowing the geometrical structure of the molecules around us is one of the most important and fundamental issues in the field of chemistry. This course introduces the two primary methods used to determine the geometrical structure of molecules: molecular spectroscopy and gas electron diffraction.\nIn molecular spectroscopy, molecules are irradiated with light or electric waves to reveal rich information, including:\n\nMotions of electrons within a molecule (Week 1),\nVibrational motions of the nuclei within a molecule (Week 2), and\nRotational motions of a molecule (Week 3).\n\nIn the gas electron diffraction method, molecules are irradiated with an accelerated electron beam. As the beam is scattered by the nuclei within the molecule, the scattered waves interfere with each other to generate a diffraction pattern. In week 4, we study the fundamental mechanism of electron scattering and how the resulting diffraction images reveal the geometrical structure of molecules.\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to understand molecular vibration plays an important role in determining the geometrical structure of molecules and gain a fuller understanding of molecular structure from the information obtained by the two methodologies.\n \nFAQ\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\nNo, you can learn the contents without any textbooks. However, if you hope to learn more on the subjects treated in this course, you are recommended to read the textbook introduced below:\nKaoru Yamanouchi, “Quantum Mechanics of Molecular Structures,” Springer-Verlag, 2012.\n",

    "description": "Educators have an ever-increasing stream of data at their fingertips, but knowing how to use this data to improve learning and teaching — how to make it less overwhelming, more useful, and part of an effective collaborative process — can be challenging.\r\n \r\nBased on the book Data Wise: A Step-by-Step Guide to Using Assessment Results to Improve Teaching and Learning, this course describes a clear, 8-step process for using a wide range of data sources to improve instruction. You will see what this disciplined way of working with colleagues can look and feel like in a school setting. You will also have the opportunity to share insights and experiences about school improvement with educators from around the world.\r\n \r\nIn this course, you will:\n\nUnderstand what the Data Wise Improvement Process is and how it can help you improve teaching and learning.\nBuild skills in looking at a wide range of data sources, including test scores, student work, and teaching practice.\nIdentify next steps in supporting a culture of collaborative data inquiry in your setting.\n\n\nIntroduction to Data Wise is open to all, but is especially valuable for teachers and school and district leaders, as well as policymakers, and educational entrepreneurs who are dedicated to improving outcomes for students. There are several ways you could take this course:\n\nParticipate on your own.\nEnroll with a few colleagues as part of a study group.\nFormally integrate it into professional development in your workplace.\n\nIt is a self-paced course. You can go through the essential materials in a day or take several weeks to allow for reflection. There will be one month of active course facilitation, which will include discussion board moderation, office hours, and other live events.\r\n \r\nThis course provides an introduction to a rich portfolio of books, resources, training, and support developed by the Data Wise Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The Data Wise Project works in partnership with teachers and school and system leaders to develop and field-test resources that support collaborative school improvement.

With L’Orfeo, Monteverdi helped to establish the techniques and traditions that continue to inform the genre of opera to this day.\nHarvard’s Thomas Forrest Kelly (Morton B. Knafel Professor of Music) guides learners through the first half of L’Orfeo, highlighting aspects of operatic form and dramatic technique, the rehearsals and cultural context for the premiere performance, and the work’s continued relevance today. There will also be a focus on Monteverdi’s life and work as a Renaissance court musician.\nIn this music course, you will learn the basics of operatic form and analysis, the genres and styles used, and the circumstances of this opera’s first performance and subsequent history. Learners in this course need not have any prior musical experience.\n",

    "description": "Today, computer graphics is a central part of our lives, in movies, games, computer-aided design, virtual simulators, visualization and even imaging products and cameras.  This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.\n\r\nStudents will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing.  We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement.  Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes.  Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. \nThis course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:\n\nOverview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)\nTransformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)\nOpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)\nRaytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)\n\nThis term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.\n\nFAQ\nWhat is the format of the class?\nThe class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. \nYour score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.\nProgramming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\nYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\nNothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.\nWhat computer system do I need for the course?\nThe course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.\nWill I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?\nThis is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.\nCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\nYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.\nI have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?\nIn most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.\nI have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?\nThe course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.\n \n",

While this makes the writing difficult to understand at first, it also gives us a window into the language of the time.\n\r\nThe story is noted for its colorful descriptions of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in the American South after the Civil War, this book features a society that has ceased to exist about twenty years prior. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often described as a satire on deep-rooted attitudes, particularly racism, in the South.\r\n \r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches.

In particular, we will discuss parametric distributions, including binomial, exponential, and gamma, and describe maximum likelihood estimation. We provide several examples of how these concepts are applied in next generation sequencing and microarray data.

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the batch effect: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.\nFinally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

    "description": "Tokyo emerged out of the ruins of war to become a large city of 10 million people in only a quarter of a century. During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation and Americanism; 2) imperial gaze and royal wedding; 3) The Olympic city; and 4) economic-cultural clash in Shinjuku. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.\n",

    "description": "The history of postwar Tokyo reveals an essential feature of the modern city, i.e. the city as a place of visualities. In postwar Tokyo, countless gazes fell upon others; gazes from and upon Americans and the Emperor, gazes going up skyscrapers or rushing aggressively through the cityscape, and gazes twining and wriggling among classes, genders, and ethnic groups in downtown Tokyo. In Part 2, we will focus on the geopolitics of these gazes in modern Tokyo. What kinds of gazes fell upon the war orphans, the poor, and the marginalized groups in Tokyo? How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes? Moreover, how did cinema or television shows, as media for these gazes, implicate the whole city? In answering these questions, we will identify the geopolitics historically involved in the practice of “visualizing postwar Tokyo.”\n \n",

    "description": "Supply chains, especially global supply chains, are complex structures that involve several businesses crossing multiple time zones and continents. The design of a supply chain is critical to its overall success, and ultimately, the firm’s success. This business and management course will cover all aspects of supply chain design.\nWe will start with learning how to design for the flow of physical products or goods. Variously referred to as Network Design, Facility Location, or Flow Optimization, the physical design is a core requirement for any supply chain planner.\nFollowing this, we will dive into the design of the financial flows involved with supply chains. Specifically, you will learn how to translate supply chain terms and metrics into financial terms used in the C-suite.\nWe will then proceed into the design and management of the information flow of a supply chain by examining three critical phases: procurement, production, and demand planning. Our primary objective here is to understand how a business works with different partners in these three basic supply chain activities.\nThe procurement lessons will cover basic approaches as well as more advanced techniques such as combinatorial auctions and supply contracts. The production lessons will concentrate on material resource planning (MRP) and fixed horizon planning. The demand management lessons will examine collaboration as well as sales and operations planning (S&OP). After covering the design of the three flows (physical, financial, and information), we will turn to the design of the supply chain organization itself as well as the metrics. Real cases and examples from practice will be used throughout the entire course.\nThis course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC2x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos. \nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations.\n",

    "description": "Banking and financial markets encompass the ‘ecosystem’ that (a) channelizes money from those who have it (i.e., savers/investors) to those who need it (i.e., borrowers) and (b) facilitate cross-border flow of funds through exchange of currencies. That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years. However, in recent times they have also been the subject of abuse, failures and economic distress in several countries resulting in a ‘contagion’ that has concurrently impacted several countries around the World! \nMore recently, and perhaps more importantly, thanks to the liberalization of most economies, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries. Banking institutions and financial markets, being the predominant conduit for such free flow of capital across countries, have therefore become even more ‘globally interconnected’. Such a globally interconnected financial system, combined with regulatory systems that are country-specific and hence varying considerably in rigor and implementation, has further compounded the risks and the consequent contagion, as witnessed in the global financial meltdown that was triggered in 2008.\nThis course titled “Introduction to Banking and Financial Markets” will be delivered in two parts. The first part will help you demystify the role of banking and financial markets in any country, the products and services they offer and the underlying market mechanisms.\nThe second part of the course will examine the risks embedded in banking and financial markets, how these risks have been heightened because of a globally interconnected world and the regulatory and governance mechanisms to minimize adverse outcomes in such a complex system.\n",

    "description": "This is an interactive course about the basic concepts of Systems, Control and their impact in all the human activities. First, the basic concepts of systems, dynamics, structure and control are introduced. Then, looking at many examples in Nature and human made devices, we will realize that the dynamic behavior of most systems can be modified by adding a control system. Later we will see how knowing how to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a system and measure its performance will provide the tools to design new controlled systems fulfilling some requirements.\n\r\nBy considering which are the benefits of control and the challenges for the future we will open the mind to tackle new applications and develop new scenarios from the micro-systems level to the common systems and the whole universe. An overview of the techniques available for a deeper introduction to the subject will be presented at the end.\n\r\nControl technology is said to be a hidden technology. We do not notice it under normal operation, but it appears if a failure happens. Looking around in Nature and at human made devices, we realize that their behavior presents analogies and that we can manipulate their temporal evolution.\n\r\nCharacterizing the dynamic behavior of systems and the possibility to change it by introducing control devices is the main aim of the course. You will learn to analyze the dynamic properties of a system and the options to change its behavior according to some requirements.You will learn the basic concepts to undertake further studies in control engineering and its use in a variety of disciplines, from human and social sciences to any engineering field. \n",

Ethical leaders, therefore, are leaders whose characters have been shaped by the wisdom, habits and practices of particular traditions, often more than one, yet they tend be identified with a particular cultural ethos and narrative. Finally, ethical leadership asks the question of values in reference to ultimate concern.\nCourse participants will engage with the course in a number of ways including the development of an Ethical Leadership Toolkit (ELT). The ELT is an instrument for leaders who engage the complex ethical questions in public space and includes the following: Ethical Leadership Model; Ethical Decision-Making Model; Ways of Doing Ethics; Remembering, Retelling and Reliving Stories; and Looking, Listening and Learning. Participants will be invited to develop their own Ethical Leadership Toolkit through video exercises led by Professor Fluker, survey questions, discussion forums, journaling and assessments.\nStudents who pass this course are eligible to take a 6 week online addendum course and receive graduate credits as a non-matriculating student from Boston University. The addendum course will go deeper into the MOOC material with discussion, readings and written assignments. Enroll Now to find more details within the courseware.\n",

    "description": "The cell is a powerful case study to help us explore the functional logic of living systems. All organisms, from single-celled algae to complex multicellular organisms like us, are made up of cells. In this course, you will learn the how and why of biology by exploring the function of the molecular components of cells, and how these cellular components are organized in a complex hierarchy.\nThis course is designed to explore the fundamentals of cell biology. The overarching goal is for learners to understand, from a human-centered perspective, that cells are evolving ensembles of macromolecules that in turn form complex communities in tissues, organs, and multicellular organisms.\nWe will focus, in particular, on the mitochondrion, the organelle that powers the cell. In this context, we will look at the processes of cell metabolism. Finally, we will examine the F1F0 ATP synthase, the molecular machine that is responsible for the synthesis of most of the ATP that your cells require to do work. To underscore the importance of cell biology to our lives, we will address questions of development and disease and implications of science in society.\nBy the end of four weeks, we hope learners will have a deep intuition for the functional logic of a cell. Together we will ask how do things work within a cell, why do they work the way they do, and how are we impacted?\nJoin us as we explore the extraordinary and wonderfully dynamic world of the cell.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "Le christianisme s’oppose-t-il à la raison philosophique ? Ce questionnement d’ordre général peut trouver une première réponse dans l’étude historique de la confrontation entre christianisme et philosophie dans l’Antiquité. Cette confrontation a joué un rôle très important dans la constitution de la doctrine chrétienne. Elle prend la forme d’une polémique entre les chrétiens et les philosophes, mais également d’un rapprochement, les chrétiens reprenant à la philosophie un grand nombre de concepts et de modes de raisonnement pour penser, exprimer et défendre leur foi. On verra ce qui oppose le christianisme et la philosophie comme deux voies d’accès concurrentes à la vérité, avant d’envisager différents aspects de la dette du christianisme à l’égard de la philosophie antique. On se demandera pour finir quel a été le rôle du christianisme dans l’histoire de la philosophie en tant que telle.\nCe cours constitue une introduction au christianisme des origines ainsi qu’au monde intellectuel de l’Empire romain. Il permettra de comprendre comment se sont constitués les aspects centraux de la doctrine chrétienne. On évoquera aussi dans ce cadre les modalités pratiques de la production et de la transmission des idées dans l’Antiquité (papyrus, manuscrits) avec l’intervention de plusieurs spécialistes.  \n",

As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables, arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated development environment.\nThis course is comprised of two 5-week parts.\nPart 1 introduces programming fundamentals.\n\nProblem solving\nPrimitive data types and arithmetic expressions\nObject-oriented programming basics\nBranching and Loops\nArrays\n\nPart 2 covers the following topics.\n\nString manipulation\nFile I/O\nSimple event-driven programming\nRecursion\nAbstract data types\n\n\nFAQ\nWhat software will be required for this course?\nWe will use Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) to give the computer the capability to run java programs and use BlueJ as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Java programs.\nWhich version of Java will be used in this course?\nThe course is based on Java Version 7. It is fine that if you would like to use Java Version 8, but the new features introduced in Version 8 will not be covered by this course.\nWhat are the system requirements for MS Windows users?\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by MS Windows XP or above (except Windows RT). Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Internet Explorer 8+ or Firefox 3.6+ or Google Chrome to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\nWhat are the system requirements for Mac users?\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or above. Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Safari 5.1.3+ or Firefox 3.6+ (64-bit) to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Google Chrome is not supported. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\nWhat are the system requirements for Linux users?\nJava Version 7 and BlueJ are supported by Ubuntu/Debian Linux. OpenJDK, an implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK), will need to be installed on the system. You will also need Firefox 3.6+ to access the demonstration programs on the course web site. Documentation on the setup details can be found in the course handout to be given in week 1.\nCan I use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) other than BlueJ?\nIn this course, we would recommend BlueJ to beginning programmers as it is compact and provides just enough features for learning programming. Most of the programming examples in this course assume using BlueJ. However, you may use other professional IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans according to your own preference.\nWill I be required to view Java Applets for learning the course materials?\nThere will be some demonstration programs shown as Java Applets in this course. However, these applets will only act as supplementary materials. Inaccessible to the applets would not affect the learning of the course materials. To access the applets, you will have to enable or activate Java plug-in on the browser. The plug-in requires 32-bit version of Java Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) on MS Windows, 64-bit version of JRE on Mac OS X or 32/64-bit version of OpenJDK on Linux depending on the architecture of the system.\n",

Alrededor del 80% de estos teléfonos llevaban en su interior el sistema operativo Android. No cabe duda, por lo tanto, de que formarse en Android es una de las mejores inversiones que puede hacer un programador en la actualidad.\nComo cabría esperar, escribir aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles no es lo mismo que hacerlo para ordenadores de sobremesa. Las aplicaciones móviles deben ser capaces de ejecutarse en un rango enorme de dispositivos, no solo teléfonos, sino también relojes, pulseras, coches y televisores. Android da una respuesta satisfactoria a estos desafíos en código abierto y recientemente ha añadido plataformas como Android Wear, Android TV y Android Auto, que abren una nueva frontera de desarrollo.\nEl objetivo de este curso es que los estudiantes aprendan los fundamentos de la programación en Android mediante el desarrollo paso a paso de una aplicación. Al finalizar el curso cada estudiante habrá completado un pequeño juego casi sin darse cuenta, adquiriendo los conocimientos necesarios para utilizar los principales elementos de Android como son las actividades, los ficheros de diseño, las intenciones, los fragmentos, los menús, los diálogos, las preferencias, etc.\nEsperamos que disfrutes del curso.\n",

He will not only walk the student through the basics of medical knowledge training and practice in the Jewish Middle Ages and beyond, but he will also show how clues gleaned from the particular elements of a manuscript (such as marginal notes, mistakes, and handwriting) allow us to learn a great deal that we could not have gleaned from a pristine printed version. The course is made up of eight short video lectures (5-7 minutes each) that explore the fascinating highlights of an extraordinary manuscript.\nWhile no previous knowledge is required, this course will be of most interest to advanced students of Jewish and medieval medicine studies in that it introduces a rare and fascinating medical text from the University of Pennsylvania’s manuscript collections.\n",

How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?\r\n \r\nAre you ready to go beyond the “what\" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?\r\n \r\nTake a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing.

    "description": "Humanity faces an immense challenge: providing abundant energy to everyone without wrecking the planet. If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic—particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed?\nEnergy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices.\nThis course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.\nThis course:\n\nCovers engineering, environmental science, and economics to enable critical, quantitative thinking about our energy system\nFocuses on a working understanding of energy technologies, rich in details of real devices and light on theory; you won’t find any electrodynamics here but will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location\nCovers environmental impacts of the energy system, focusing on air pollution, climate change, and land use\nEmphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses\nEmphasizes quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent?  Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency?  And how do we include considerations other than cost?\n\nPlease note that this is an abridged course, equivalent to roughly half of a full semester-long undergraduate course.

    "description": "This history course delves into the medieval history of the city of Burgos, from its inception in 884 c.e. as the homeland of the Spanish Kingdom of Castile and Leon, until the completion of the Spanish Reconquista in 1492. We will study complicated legendary heroes like Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, “The Cid”, both a champion of the Christian Reconquista and a friend of Islamic rulers, who lays buried in the Cathedral of Burgos. Like the Cid, medieval Burgos presented two competing views for Spain’s future – one centered on overt Castilian supremacy and another more nuanced one that incorporated religious minorities, especially Jews and Jewish converts to Christianity (conversos), into every element of political, economic, and even religious life.\nThis course will investigate the disastrous impact of the Plague and how it led to the death of King Alfonso XI and the ruinous civil war between the half-brothers, Pedro “The Cruel” and Enrique II of Trastamára. We will also appraise the collapse of the kingdom’s “Old Christian” nobility and the generation of new elite clans, some of whom hailed from Jewish ancestries. It was also the era of anti-Jewish pogroms, Christian fixations on “blood purity” and unsuccessful pleas for Christian harmony, and the last gasps of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim coexistence.\nWe will virtually-tour the Cathedral of Burgos, the Museum of Burgos, and what remains of the city’s medieval neighborhoods and structures. We will also study and transcribe intriguing vellum and paper manuscripts from the cathedral and municipal archives so that we discover new facets of this history.\nNo knowledge of Spanish is needed to participate in the course or in our transcription efforts.\n",

    "description": "We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.  Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law – in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward – to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor – a natural dào.\nWe will look at two rival directions this natural dào model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the dào of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance – Medieval Chinese Buddhism.\nAlthough Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.\n",

    "description": "Since the introduction of mass production, the concept of “quality” has evolved from simple assembly line inspections to a broad approach to production and management involving an entire corporation. Quality has become a critical driver for long-term success through continuous process improvement and customer satisfaction. Quality Management today concerns the entire value chain, encompassing multi-tiered supplier networks and customer service and returns.\nThis business and management course balances the quantitative elements of quality engineering with a managerial approach to using quality in an organization to effect change. We cover the statistical basics needed for a Six-Sigma Green Belt certification, following the well-known process-improvement cycle: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The most important quality methods and techniques are taught, including sampling, statistical process control, process capability, regression analysis, and design of experiments. Quality management is examined, from the viewpoint of quality incorporated into product design, measuring and controlling quality in production and improving quality, using interactive, guided projects and case studies. The course closes with the presentation of a full Six-Sigma project.\nThe contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding TUM class (Quality Engineering and Management) and will enable you to immediately understand and apply quality concepts in your work and research.\nWHY TAKE THIS COURSE? \n\nQuality issues appear everywhere and affect the entire organisation.\nYou'll quickly master quality concepts so that you can apply quality tools and drive quality programs within your own organisation.\nYou'll gain the fundamentals for a Six-Sigma Green Belt in a manageable and positive learning environment, along with the chance to discuss with staff and fellow learners worldwide.\n\n",

This environmental studies course will examine the principles of production ecology and the ‘availability pillar’ of global food security that lie at the heart of food production, which can be applied to both crops and animal production. This course will discuss why yields in some parts of the world are lagging behind and identify the agro-ecological drivers that shape the wide diversity of production systems.\nFurthermore, key issues relating to the closing of yield gaps and the difference in visions of sustainability will be explored.\nThis online course will be of great interest to international students and those with varied educational backgrounds, both professionally and culturally, to enrich their views and action perspectives related to global food security and food systems. Professor Ken E. Giller will introduce learners to crop production and underlying bio-physical principles in order to identify constraining factors in yield formation. He will explain how to assess yield gaps at the level of fields and production systems around the world, contributing to efficient resource management. Wageningen University and Research, through its unique systems-based approach to food systems, adds the phase of primary production to the broad context of global food security.\n",

    "description": "Whether you are an EU citizen or not, this course concerns you! The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a silver thread in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.\nThis EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions:\n\nWhat factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?\nWhich actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations.\nIn key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.\n\nAll of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules:\n\nThe EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence\nPromoting Human Rights inside the EU\nPromoting Human Rights in EU External Action\nCapitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws\n\nThis course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights. The course also comprises a wealth of bibliographical resources, and frequent exercises to test what you have learned.\nThis MOOC is based on the FRAME project (www.fp7-frame.eu), which has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration.

The course begins by presenting measurable criteria for the assessment of livability, and how to positively influence the design of cities towards greater livability. We will focus on this basic topic of the human habitat in a holistic way, and introduce possibilities of participatory urban design by citizens, leading towards the development of a citizen design science.\nYou will be able to share your experiences with the other participants in the course and also with the experts from the teaching team. In completing this course, you will better understand how to make a city more livable by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different properties and impact factors of the urban system.\nLivability in Future Cities is the second course in a series of MOOCs under the title “Future Cities.” This series aims to bring the latest research on planning, managing and transforming cities to places where this knowledge has the highest benefit for its citizens. “Future Cities” provided an overview, and this course will focus on livability in existing and new cities. \n",

    "description": "One of the key components when you plan and deploy Microsoft Windows Server is storage. Most organizations require lots of storage because users and applications are constantly working with and creating data.\nAs a Microsoft Windows Server System Administrator you must be able to:  \n\nIdentify and decide on the type of storage your organization needs\nManage disks, volumes, and file systems\nUse BitLocker to secure volumes\nEncrypt data with Encrypted File System (EFS)\n\nFurthermore, optimizing Microsoft Windows Server storage is key to keeping pace with your organization’s ever increasing data needs. Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication.\niSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure.\nStorage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage.\nData Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space.\nGo beyond simple storage strategies and take control of your organization’s storage needs!\nThis self-paced interactive computer science course is the second in a series of courses where you’ll have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Windows Server 2012 operating system administrative tasks.

    "description": "A successful manager makes good decisions. To make good decisions, you need to understand the market forces that impact your business and personal life. This is true for managers in large multinationals or small businesses, in non-profit organizations or in the government. Individuals and households also make decisions. They decide on what to learn, where to work, how much to save, where to invest, and what goods to buy, among others. Most modern societies depend on markets to organize economic activity: they are market economies. A large number of decisions you make as individuals or as managers relate to markets. So it is important for you to know how markets work and how to make good decisions as a manager or as an individual operating in a market environment. This is what this course will teach you.\nMost business schools have a course on Managerial Economics as part of the MBA curriculum. Exposure to Economics is essential for all students of management. This course will provide a simple introduction to Managerial Economics and use minimum mathematics.\n",

    "description": "This literature course will examine James Joyce’s collection of fifteen short stories called simply Dubliners. This volume was first published in 1914, but not without a struggle. Joyce first submitted these stories to a publisher in 1905, and had it rejected 17 times before it was finally published in 1914. It has become one of the classics of English language literature, despite its rocky beginnings.\n\nDubliners depicts middle class Irish life in the early part of the 20th century. The first stories are narrated by protagonists who are children. As the stories continue, they examine the lives of characters in increasingly older stages of life. Interestingly, many of the characters who appear in these short stories appear later in minor roles in Joyce’s famous novel Ulysses.\r\n \r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\r\n \r\nThis is the fifth part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.\n",

You might keep track of stock prices, but how can you figure out how much money you've made (or lost) in the market? And you may already know how to tell time, but can you calculate at what times a clock's hour and minute hands are exactly aligned? With algebra, you can answer all of these questions, using the numbers you already know to solve for the unknown. Algebra is an essential tool for all of high school and college-level math, science, and engineering. So if you're starting out in one of these fields and you haven't yet mastered algebra, then this is the course for you!\r\n \r\nIn this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material.

    "description": "More than 2000 years ago, long before rockets were launched into orbit or explorers sailed around the globe, a Greek mathematician measured the size of the Earth using nothing more than a few facts about lines, angles, and circles. This course will start at the very beginnings of geometry, answering questions like \"How big is an angle?\" and \"What are parallel lines?\" and proceed up through advanced theorems and proofs about 2D and 3D shapes. Along the way, you'll learn a few different ways to find the area of a triangle, you'll discover a shortcut for counting the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza, and you'll even come up with your own estimate for the size of the Earth.\r\n \r\nIn this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material. GeometryX covers a standard curriculum in high school geometry, and CCSS (common core) alignment is indicated where applicable.\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\nThis course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.\n",

Administrators want to explore how all of their students and faculty are doing and to anticipate emerging changes. The public wants to know what happens in college and why.\nEveryone has questions. We have the chance to help them find answers.\nPractical Learning Analytics has a specific goal: to help us collectively ponder learning analytics in a concrete way.

More often than not, innovation is about ordinary people solving problems that matter to them personally. This could be you.\nFirst, think about what you need. Next, find out whether others want the same thing. If they do, you can start a venture – for profit or non-profit - to supply others with the novel product or service you first developed for yourself.\nThe examples of user innovation are infinite. A surfer created the GoPro to take “selfies” while surfing. A student came up with Dropbox after forgetting his flash drive. Two broke entrepreneurs rented out their living room to help pay rent, and Airbnb was born. They’ll share their paths to startup success.\nTaught by Eric von Hippel, the founding scholar of user innovation, this course will help you think about what problems you should choose to solve and how to share your innovations with others.\nYou can innovate.\n",

    "description": "Have you created an outline and now feel prepared to start writing your novel? Or have you started a novel draft only to find your interest or confidence waning? In this course, the international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s renowned MFA program introduce the essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts. \nWhile ideas and inspiration are often enough to ignite interest in writing a novel, writers can quickly lose confidence, especially when their best efforts have inadvertently produced flat characters, waning conflicts, tangled plots and weak dialogue. Reaching your goal of writing (and perhaps, publishing) a novel requires an understanding of fiction’s deeper mechanics and a familiarity with the specific craft elements that will help translate your creativity and imagination into compelling paragraphs, scenes and chapters.\nThrough writing exercises aimed at developing new skills, concrete examples from published novels, feedback and discussion with fellow writers and opportunities to identify and strengthen weaknesses in their own projects, learners will broaden their knowledge of fiction craft as they explore creating memorable characters, the art of scene design, tactics for managing unwieldy plots and steps for writing layered and meaningful dialogue.\nWhether you’re beginning your novel draft or nearing the end, this course is a unique opportunity to learn the essentials of strong fiction writing from award-winning authors sharing their proven methods and approaches.\nThe course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, those participating in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has a novel in progress.\nFAQ\nDo I need to complete Part 1: Planning and Outlining to take this course?\nNo. As long as you are in the process of writing a novel, this course will be valuable to you. Of course, we strongly recommend starting with an outline, as your novel writing process will be much more efficient, but it’s not required.\nIs this course related to an existing UBC writing class? \nThis is an entirely new course, created by instructors with years of experience teaching the art of fiction writing to undergraduate and graduate university students as well as members of the community.\nWhat are the other courses in the series?\nHow to Write a Novel – Part 1: Plan and Outline explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline: a blueprint for a successful draft of your novel. How to Write a Novel – Part 3: Edit and Revise, is in the early stages of development. When it is launched, it will be suitable for students who have completed a full draft of their novel.\n",

    "description": "New week 6 content has been added in the fourth iteration of this popular course!\nJoin the Smithsonian, and comic book industry legend Stan Lee, to explore the history of the comic book and the rise of superheroes.\nThe ancient gods of Egyptian, Greek and Roman myths still exist, but today, they have superpowers, human foibles and secret identities. They come from comic books and graphic novels, and have taken over pop culture on the stage, screen, video games, and animation.\r\n \r\nFrom Superman® and Spider-Man®, to The Avengers® and The Hulk® and beyond, who are these heroes? And, how have they evolved from folklore and myth, across all cultures and religions?\r\n \r\nLearn from Smithsonian and industry experts including:\n\nStan Lee, who was one of the creators of the modern superhero template. His early comics featuring Spider-Man, Iron Man®, The Hulk, Thor®, and The Avengers led Marvel to success. He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nMichael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including The Dark Knight series, Lego® Movie, the animated Batman films and Batman® VS Superman. \n\nIn this course, we explore the following questions:\n\nWhy did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their “Golden Age” during World War II?\nWhy did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades?\nHow have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930’s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices? \nWhy was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950’s? \nHow did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20th Century? \nWhen and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools? \nWhen and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz? \nFinally, when and how did comic books become “cool” and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe?\n\nFor the first time ever, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today’s world.\nAs you learn about how cultural myths, world events, and personal experiences shaped the first superheroes, you will apply these frameworks to create your own superhero– or you can choose to do a deeper analysis on existing comic book heroes. This original project is required for certification and anything created by you as part of the course is the intellectual property of you and you alone.  At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to take your final project work and participate with other current and alumni students in a two week “team track add-on\" to the course. \nAt last, fans, students and seekers of knowledge have the opportunity to enroll in the ultimate comic book course.\n",

In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions.\nFinancial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy.\nIn Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF's Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.)\nDuring the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you.\nWhether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey!\nFinancial Programming and Policies, Part 1 is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.\n",

    "description": "Examine how architecture reflects Japan’s history, starting with its emergence as a new nation in the 19th century and the building of the Western-style capital city of Tokyo on the foundations of Edo. New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in architecture throughout Japan.\nAfter exploring the intense Westernization Japan experienced to rival the world’s developed countries, we will turn to look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame.\nLastly, we will mount an interview-based case study titled “Exploring Tokyo Tech’s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.” Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of architects and a campus consisting of their buildings. We will learn about Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech.\nThis course aims to illustrate the present state of Japanese Modernist and postmodern building, as well as the distance covered over the past 150 years, including the 130-year history of Tokyo Tech itself. Join us on this journey through time as we examine and admire Japan’s architecture to better understand Japanese history. \n",

While the course is centered around the why, how, and when of randomized evaluations, it will also impart insights on the importance of a needs assessment, measuring outcomes effectively, quality control, and monitoring methods that are useful for all kinds of evaluations. \nThis social impact course is designed for people from a variety of backgrounds: managers and researchers from international development organizations, foundations, governments, and non-governmental organizations from around the world, as well as trained economists looking to retool.\n",

As citizens, we want a fair trial before being punished for a crime; but as citizens, we want to stop terrorists before they attack us. As decision-makers, we value the advice we get from data-driven algorithms; but as decision-makers, we also worry about unintended bias. Many data scientists learn the tools of the trade and get down to work right away, without appreciating the possible consequences of their work.\nThis course focused on ethics specifically related to data science will provide you with the framework to analyze these concerns. This framework is based on ethics, which are shared values that help differentiate right from wrong. Ethics are not law, but they are usually the basis for laws.\nEveryone, including data scientists, will benefit from this course. No previous knowledge is needed.\n",

How do designers create an experience for the player? What about prototyping and iterating?\nThis course explores these questions and others through six content units over seven weeks. Participants will be introduced to game design and game design concepts, emphasizing the basic tools of game design: paper and digital prototyping, design iteration, and user testing. The audience for this course includes current and aspiring game designers and those interested in delving deeply into the game creation process.\nFor the course project, participants will create either a digital game or a board game.

This is used to understand the spectrum of central potentials and to introduce hidden symmetries. Lastly, you will learn about the addition of angular momentum and an algebraic approach to the hydrogen atom spectrum.\nThis is the last of three courses offering a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation.\n\nPart 1: Wave Mechanics\nPart 2: Quantum Dynamics\nPart 3: Entanglement and Angular Momentum\n\nTo follow this course you should have taken Part 1: Wave Mechanics, and Part 2: Quantum Dynamics.\nCompleting the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics\nThe series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors. \nLearner Testimonials\n“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”\n “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”\nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n",

    "description": "Marketing excellence is a prerequisite for success in any business, from startups to the world’s most established enterprises, yet the art and science of marketing is constantly evolving. Arm yourself with the essential principles and practices of marketing in the digital economy by making this course, taught by Internet consumer shopping expert and Wharton professor David Bell, an indispensable part of your knowledge base.\nIn this business and management course, you will gain an understanding of how the digital economy works and develop the critical insights necessary to succeed in e-commerce and digital and social media marketing.\nThe fixed and mobile Internet and related technologies exert a profound influence on how business and social institutions evolve, how they are challenged—and sometimes, even displaced. Companies that were non-existent a few short years ago, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Uber, have dramatically changed how we interact, communicate and get from point A to B. Even Amazon and Google are relatively “young” by any measure. If you’re an entrepreneur, investor, manager, or student, you need thoughtful approaches to navigate and win in this new environment.\nThis course is organized around four broad themes and we will use relevant theory and analysis, as well as numerous practical examples to develop our key learning points.\nThe themes are:\n\nBehavioral foundations for understanding and navigating the new online-offline landscape\nNew forms of interaction, including formation of networks and reputation building\nTools and principles of digital marketing action including online advertising on fixed and mobile devices\nNew media platforms and emergence of “organic” celebrities and communities\n\nThis course is beneficial to marketing professionals, analysts, entrepreneurs, small business owners, investors, and consumers This course evolved from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School’s very first course on digital marketing and e-commerce.\n",

This course will teach you the basic concepts of systems biology, including engineering principles and tools developed for dynamic systems (e.g., robots) to better model and understand biological dynamics.\nYou will learn how simple math operations, addition and multiplication, can be used to model and simulate dynamic biological behaviors. Different types of “gene circuits” will be modeled and simulated using Octave Online, a web-based programming tool.\nThis course is geared towards secondary/ high school STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) educators and students. Basic programming skills will be taught in a step-wise manner so no prior programming experience or knowledge is necessary.\n",

When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement — and should we care?

Get behind the headlines — and polarized debates — and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations.\nDesigned to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

    "description": "In the last decade, the amount of data available to organizations has reached unprecedented levels. Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications. \nThe class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a “quick question” to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we’ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). In the middle of the class, we will run an analytics competition, and at the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.\n \nFAQ\nWhat do I need to know about the topic prior to enrolling in the course?\nYou only need to know basic mathematics. For most people, this is equivalent to basic high school mathematics. You should know concepts like mean, standard deviation, and histograms. This course is also useful for those who already have experience in the subject.  In each lecture, recitation, and homework assignment, we use a different dataset and case to illustrate the method. Even if you are familiar with all of the methods taught, you can still learn a lot from the different examples.\nWhat software will be used in the course?\nWe’ll be using two software programs in this class: R and LibreOffice. Both are free online, and you don’t need to be familiar with either of them to take the course. R is a free statistical and computing software environment and LibreOffice is similar to MS Office but a free open source program. Specifically we’ll use the LibreOffice module, Calc in this course. Don’t worry though - we’ll teach everything from scratch!\n",

    "description": "There is no doubt that technological innovation is one of the key elements driving human progress. However, new technologies raise ethical questions, have serious implications for society and the environment and pose new risks, often unknown and unknowable before the new technologies reach maturity.\nFor example, how can we make sure that “smart cities” and other data-based services strike a balance between the benefits the service provides and the risks it poses to the security of citizens? What are the ethical questions surrounding self-driving vehicles or autonomous weapons? What are the health risks of nanotechnologies? All these create new risks and raise serious ethical questions. The challenge is to innovate in a way that benefits both companies and society – to innovate responsibly.\nThis course provides both a theoretical and practical framework for assessing and designing responsible innovations, combined with real-world examples. The first part (weeks 1 and 2) of the course focuses on ethical questions and concerns, such as: a fair distribution of costs and benefits, moral obligations and individual and collective responsibilities. The second part (weeks 3 and 4) deals with (unknown) risks and safety of new technologies including a number of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods. The last part of the course (weeks 5, 6 and 7) is about the management of responsible innovations and evolving a new, value driven, design process.\nCase studies during the course include nanotechnology, self-driving vehicles, smart meters for electricity, autonomous weapons, nuclear energy and CO2capture and storage together with their related ethical and safety concerns.  Affordable innovations for low-income groups and emerging markets are also covered in the course.\nThe course includes a free e-book.\nThe course will be of benefit to innovation and risk managers, entrepreneurs, policy analysts, engineers, designers and strategic advisors who are looking for a methodical approach with which to judge responsible innovations.\n \n",

    "description": "This literature course, the sixth module in the Poetry in America series, explores a diverse array of American Modernist poets and poems.  While “Modernism” is notoriously difficult to define, the movement spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and the poetry of this period marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms.  \nThroughout this module, we will encounter such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We will study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American Modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's THE WASTE LAND, we will see the sites that witnessed—and cultivated—the rise of American Modernism.  \nLed by Harvard Professor Elisa New, the Poetry in America series surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America takes learners on a journey through the literature of a nation. Along the way, distinguished guests including Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American poetry.\n",

    "description": "1865-1890: The Unfinished Revolution, examines the pivotal but misunderstood era of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, the first effort in American history to construct an interracial democracy. Beginning with a discussion of the dramatic change in historians’ interpretations of the period in the last two generations, the course goes on to discuss how Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today. Among these are: who is an American citizen and what are citizens’ rights; what is the relationship between political and economic freedom; which has the primary responsibility for protecting Americans’ rights – the federal or state governments; and how should public authorities respond to episodes of terrorism? The course explores the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to incorporate the principle of equality regardless of race; the accomplishments and failings of Reconstruction governments in the South; the reasons for violent opposition in the South and for the northern retreat from Reconstruction; and the consolidation at the end of the nineteenth century of a new system of white supremacy.\nThis course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. The XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the XSeries is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.\n",

    "description": "This short course teaches students and industry professionals how to design integrated optical devices and circuits, using a hands-on approach with commercial tools. We will fabricate your designs using a state-of-the-art ($5M) silicon photonic rapid-prototyping 100 keV electron-beam lithography facility. We will measure your designs using an automated optical probe station and provide you the data. You will then analyze your experimental data.\nWhy take this course?\n\nTo get hands on design experience with integrated optics\nTo learn how to use advanced optical design tools\nTo get your design fabricated, and obtain experimental data\n\nThe focus of this course is a design project, guided by lectures, tutorials and activities. As a first-time designer, you will design an interferometer, which is a widely used device in many applications such as communications (modulation, switching) and sensing. Specifically, it is Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, consisting of fibre grating couplers, two splitters, and optical waveguides. For advanced designers, this course is an opportunity to design many other devices, such as directional couplers, ring, racetrack and disk resonators, Bragg gratings including grating assisted contra-directional couplers, photonic crystals, multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers, polarization diversity components, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) components and circuits, novel waveguides such as sub-wavelength grating (SWG) and metamaterial waveguides, slot waveguides, etc.\nCommercial software tool licenses are provided in this course (Lumerical Solutions, Mentor Graphics, and MATLAB). Open-source alternatives are provided. Mentor Graphics tools are accessed remotely via a cloud service; the others can be run on your own computer.\nYou will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.\n\nFAQ\nHow much effort is required?\nSince this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required.\nWhat are the prerequisites for taking this course?\nPhot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python).\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\nThe notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book \"Silicon Photonics Design\", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459.\nWhat are the fabrication details? \nYour devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 µm x 605 µm of space, enough for &gt;10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants. \nWho will be doing the fabrication and measurements?\nThe fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia.\nWill I be getting a physical chip in the mail?\nNo. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants.\nAre there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail?\nYes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out. We typically do fabrication runs every two months. Additional options for  obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course.\nDo you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x?\nYes. We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging. All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries. More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca. Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.\n",

    "description": "This course will examine Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. This novel was first published as a serial novel in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray was immediately controversial, and was censored by the magazine’s editors. Even with the censorship, reviewers still thought that Wilde ought to have been prosecuted for violating laws concerning public morality. This story has two important themes: the idea of selling one’s soul, and the theme of living a double life. Wilde takes these themes to their extreme.\r\n \r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\r\n \r\nThis is the fourth part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.\n",

    "description": "Global Health is a new field within public health sciences that integrates the knowledge from fields such as epidemiology, medicine, economy and the behavioral sciences. The main aim of the course, An Introduction to Global Health, is to describe and analyze variation in health between and within countries. This will provide an understanding of causes of the variation. The course will include measurements and determinants of health. Further, the course offers a public health perspective of the global burden of diseases. The course will specifically address: Maternal and Child Health; Sexual reproductive health and rights; Major infectious disease - malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia; Non communicable disease; Mental health; Disasters; Injuries; Health systems and financing; and Health policy. Analysis will be done from a gender and equity perspective.\nThe course combines different teaching methods: lectures, self-study, and exercises using gapminder tools (Gapminder.org) to analyze indicators. An added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates an intercultural learning and teaching environment.\nBy the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how these key global health challenges are approached by different stakeholders. You will have developed an understanding of what kind of solutions exist today and hopefully you will be curious as to how to make positive difference in the world.\n",

We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.\nHow does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.\n\nChanging Perspectives\r\n\t\nParametric Equations\nPolar Coordinates\n\n\nSeries and Polynomial Approximations\r\n\t\nSeries and Convergence\nTaylor Series and Power Series\n\n\n\nThis course, in combination with Parts 1 and 2, covers the AP* Calculus BC curriculum.\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\nCalculus 1A: Differentiation\nCalculus 1B: Integration\nThis course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.\n*Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n",

The Computational Geometry taught in this course is derived from classical discrete/combinatorial geometry and modern computer science.\nComputational Geometry first appeared on the horizon when M.

Since then, this phrase has been used to refer to algorithmic study on discrete and combinatorial geometric structures and can also be regarded as the geometric version of Algorithm Design and Analysis. Computational Geometry is now considered the basis of robotics, computer aided design and manufacturing (CAM and CID), and geographic information systems (GIS).\n",

Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give students exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years, the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more students from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages students to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses.\nWe expect that students from 7.00x Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. Participants with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience, while those with a biology background should find the week on genetics easier. We recommend that students try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.\nWorkshop Content Creators and Residential Leaders\nGregory Hale, Michael Goard, Ph.D., Ben Stinson, Kunle Demuren, Sara Gosline, Ph.D., Glenna Foight, Leyla Isik, Samir El-Boustani, Ph.D., Gerald Pho, and Rajeev Rikhye\nResidential Outreach Workshop Organizer and Creator\nMandana Sassanfar, Ph.D.\nThis workshop includes activities on the following biological topics: population biology, biochemical equilibrium and kinetics, molecular modeling of enzymes, visual neuroscience, genetics, gene expression and development, and genomics. The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, StarGenetics, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.\n \n",

    "description": "Poetry lives in any reader, not necessarily in performance by the poet or a trained actor. The pleasure of actually saying a poem, or even saying it in your imagination—your mind’s ear—is essential. That is a central idea of “The Art of Poetry,” well demonstrated by the videos at favoritepoem.org: the photographer saying Sylvia Plath’s “Nick and the Candlestick,” the high school student saying Langston Hughes’ “Minstrel Man.” Those readers base what they say about each poem upon their experience of saying it.\nThe course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense reading, requiring prolonged, thorough— in fact, repeated—attention to specific poems.\nThe focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry’s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry and difficulty; kidding and tribute—with only incidental attention to “schools,” jargons, categories, and coteries.\nLearners are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one’s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to Singing School: “this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.” In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.\n",

    "description": "The goal of this course is to explore and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow’s workforce. At this time, there aren’t enough good jobs or educational opportunities in the U.S. or globally to meet the aspirations and needs of all who want and need to work or to deliver on the expectation that every generation should achieve a higher standard of living for themselves and their families than their parent’s generation. This is a fundamental ideal that drives people all over the world. In the U.S. we call it the American Dream.\nIf we take the right actions we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so we first have to understand how the world of work is changing, how firms can compete and prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies and practices governing the world of work.\nIn this business and management course, we’ll start by tracing the history of work and employment that has made the economy work so well in the past. And we’ll uncover what’s gone wrong, in order to figure out new solutions that fit today’s workforce, economy, and society. We’ll also take you on a personal journey. You’ll learn what employers expect in today’s world of work – the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We’ll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and regulators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century. We’ll make this all come alive by highlighting the experiences, contributions, and aspirations of real people who are working right now to address these challenges.\nSo join us, and let’s get started on shaping the future of work.\n",

Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”\n",

Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.\nIn this second of a two part statistics course, we will cover basic Inferential Statistics – integrating ideas of Part 1. If you have a basic knowledge of Descriptive Statistics, this course is for you. We will learn how to sample data, examine both quantitative and categorical data with statistical techniques such as t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA, and Regression.\nBoth parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).\nThis course will consist of:\n\nInstructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics.\nGuided questions to help your understanding of the topic.\nWeekly tutorial videos for using R. Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets. Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge.\n\nJoin us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them?

Workers expect consistent access to corporate tools and data regardless of the type of device they’re using. They also want their corporate-issued technology and resources to look and behave like their personal technology—always on and always available from any device, from virtually anywhere.\nAn enterprise model that supports the use of consumer devices in the workplace and the ability to work from virtually anywhere and anytime must move from a device-focused view of IT management to one that’s people centric. In reality it is not the device that is mobile, it is the users.\nIt is important that the IT challenges of BYOD, Mobile device management, cloud computing, and hybrid identities be understood before one can understand how Windows 10 helps address those issues.\n",

    "description": "Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of the 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, “who am I?” Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer, struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.\nAs a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the \"MyDante\" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante's interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.\nYou, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey towards your understanding of your personal freedom and identity.\n",

How do they say it? How does it all stitch together?\nIn this architecture course you will learn how to “read” Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome’s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city’s image of itself to its citizens (urbi) and the world (orbi).\nPopes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city’s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today.\nThe Meaning of Rome: The Renaissance and Baroque City is organized around three themes—the city and memory, the city as reliquary, and the city as theater. In uncovering some of the meaning of Rome, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to consider how our own cities and communities are, or could be, meaningful. You will come away from this course not only better informed about the cities of the past, but also better equipped to think about the cities of the present and the future.\nStudents who successfully complete all of the required course assignments will have the opportunity to compile a Digication ePortfolio and earn a digital badge. \n",

How can open government data be made available to improve public policy making? Which technologies are available to make governments more open and  use open government data?\nGovernments all over the world aim to become more open and transparent in order to establish closer ties with their constituents. However, releasing government data involves complex challenges and poses two major concerns. First, many different participants are involved and there are various dependencies between them, and second, the technologies that support open government are fragmented. In addition, it is unclear how different contexts should alter the best practices for open government.\nThis course explores the foundations and objectives of Open Government and examines current developments, including the opening and reuse of governmental data such as the release of data by governments in America and Europe.\nThis course will empower you by helping you grasp the key principles surrounding open government.\nThe topics of the course are applied to concrete cases, which you will be asked to analyze and discuss with your peers.\nThis course may be of interest to the following:\n\nStudents interested in the basics of open government, in data-driven governance and data-driven research\nProfessionals or researchers working on open government research and interested in strategies and challenges for opening governments\nProfessionals or researchers working on open data research or open data initiatives\nProfessionals and researchers working on topics related to public values, including transparency and privacy, in a governmental context\nSenior administrators, policy advisors, government officials or agency members, who are interested in how ICTs change governments and how ICTs can be used in public administrations\n\n \nLICENSE\r\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Our lives are full of combinations. Combinatorial mathematics is just the science to deal with combinations of discrete items. As an ancient field, the history of combinatorial mathematics can be traced back over 4000 years to the age of the Great Yu in ancient China. Today, combinatorial mathematics is regarded as the basis of computer science since the algorithms in programming heavily rely on the analysis of the discrete elements.\n\nInstead of relying on the traditional mathematical \"theorem - proof\" format, this course demonstrates various principles in an intuitive manner with ancient stories, the scenes of movies and even a magic show. What you’ll learn:\n\nThe counting principles based on the basic operations “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”; \nGenerating functions\nRecurrent number serials such as Fibonacci number, Catalan number, and more\nPigeon hole principles\nInclusion and exclusion principles\nPolya counting based on group theory\n\nThis course is based on a highly regarded on-campus Tsinghua class called Combinatorics, and is ideal for students who are interested in mathematics or computer science. Enroll today and learn the mathematical theory needed to solve the real-world problems!\n \n我们生活的方方面面都充满着组合，而组合数学正是研究离散事物的学科。作为一个具有悠久历史的学科，组合数学的发展可以追溯到4000年前的大禹时代。而如今组合数学随着计算机学科的发展开启了新的篇章，由于程序算法的分析和实现正是基于对离散对象的分析，因此组合数学已经发展成为计算机学科的基础理论。\n而本课程一改以往数学教学的“定理-证明”模式，引领大家由浅入深地逐步探索知识的源泉，这里有古代故事，有电影片段，甚至用魔术来演绎数学概念。而这些形式就是为了引领大家去感受数学的美。具体的教学内容包括：\n\n基于四则运算的计数法则；\n母函数；\n递推序列，如斐波那契数，卡特兰数等；\n鸽巢原理；\n容斥原理；\n基于群论的波利亚定理。\n\n本课程的内容和大纲主要基于清华大学精品课《组合数学》，通过本课程的学习，学习者可以深入了解计数的抽象理论和具体方法，从而深入理解组合数学对计算机理论发展的推动作用。。\n \n\nFAQ\nI don’t speak Chinese, can I learn the course?\nAll the materials are in English. Though the original video was recorded in Chinese, the course team record the corresponding dubbing in English. All the audio and subtitles are processed to fit the English dubbing as much as possible, so that you can enjoy this wonderful course in English.\nWhat are the textbook and the reference books for this course?\nThere is no textbook requirement for this course. The handouts distributed every week are critical. The following books are references\n\nRichard A. Brualdi; Introductory Combinatorics (5th edition), Pearson, 2009\nJ.H.van Lint and R.M. Wilson; A course in Combinatorics, Cambridge University Press, 2001\n卢开澄,《组合数学》第四版,清华大学出版社\n\nWhat is the grading breakdown?\n\n70% quizzes and exercises\n30% final exam\n\nHow can I get the certificate?\nIf your final score is no less than 60.\nDo I need to know how to program to learn this class?\nNot necessary. This course is a math course which is based on fundamental theory. But to help the students to have the intuitive feel of the effects of the theory, we also provide a code lib that you can compare different implementations by running different programs.    \n",

    "description": "This course is designed to give students a thorough introduction to early (pre-221 BCE) Chinese thought, its contemporary implications, and the role of religion in human well-being. Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.\nThis period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.\nThis course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last five weeks with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.\nPart 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi—who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision—and his former student Hanfeizi, a “Legalist” thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China’s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.\nSee also:\nChinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1\n",

    "description": "The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.\nThis course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n",

Es el tema más digno de ser meditado en esta vida y la reflexión más valiosa que puede asumir un ser humano para dar dignidad a su vida.\nSer feliz y vivir feliz, son los dos  asuntos en los que nos jugamos nuestra existencia. Las reflexiones sobre estos temas las encontramos mejor planteadas y desarrolladas en los filósofos, porque ellos han concebido su actividad filosófica como una forma de vida válida para todos los seres humanos. Esta actividad se opone a las opiniones inciertas, engañosas y desconocedoras de la naturaleza humana que abundan en nuestro medio cultural y con las cuales se quiere cubrir la felicidad con un manto oscuro e inalcanzable para las personas. Tener una conciencia feliz, permite al ser humano realizar acciones éticas o morales igualmente felices. Este camino ético de la felicidad es el que andaremos en el desarrollo de nuestro curso y en el que cada uno de los participantes encontrará buenos argumentos para ser y vivir feliz cada día.\n",

Estas preguntas están en el centro de la programación financiera. En nuestro curso PPF usted aprenderá los conceptos fundamentales para responder a estas preguntas.\nLa programación financiera es un marco que permite analizar el estado de la economía, prever el curso de su evolución y determinar las políticas económicas que pueden cambiarlo.\nLa primera parte del curso PPF, presentada por el Instituto de Capacitación del FMI, le permitirá adquirir conocimientos básicos para realizar la programación financiera. En el curso se presentan las características principales de los cuatro grandes sectores que comprenden la macroeconomía (real, fiscal, externo y monetario), enseña cómo analizar e interpretar las cuentas de estos sectores y cómo estos sectores están relacionados entre sí.\nDurante el curso, los economistas del FMI lo guiarán a través de las cuentas y el análisis de una economía. Además de las clases, usted responderá a las preguntas sobre los conceptos explicados, hará breves ejercicios numéricos, discutirá con los otros participantes sobre la evolución económica de su país y trabajará con los datos de un país imaginario. Tendrá acceso a los materiales de lectura.\nTanto si es funcionario y trabaja en cuestiones económicas para su país, como si es un profesional que maneja datos económicos o sencillamente le interesa entender mejor la evolución de una economía, este curso le entregará las herramientas para el análisis macroeconómico. ¡Esperamos con interés su participación!\nEl curso de programación y políticas financieras, Parte 1 es ofrecido por el FMI con el apoyo financiero del gobierno de Bélgica.\n",

    "description": "The Call of the Wild is a 1903 novel written by Jack London. The story is set in the Yukon, the far northern territory of Canada/Alaska, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. During this period, good sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's main character is a dog named Buck, who lives on a California ranch.\n\r\nLondon himself lived nearly a year in the Yukon, collecting material for the novel. Like many older popular novels, The Call of the Wild was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903. A month later, it was released as a  book. The novel’s great popularity and success made London famous. The appeal of this story comes from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1908, the story was adapted to film. Since then, there have been other adaptations.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\n",

The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment.\nOn the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging. With the analytic approach, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and medical doctors are pursuing an understanding of the mechanism of the mind and its biological basis, with the help of engineering and philosophy.\nThis program will help students make a basis for interdisciplinary research by providing opportunities to understand what is undertaken in other disciplines and how to collaborate and exchange ideas with people from other disciplines. We expect many motivated students to apply.\n",

This environmental context molds the country’s objectives, defines the country’s strategy, programs and policies for achieving objectives, and significantly impacts companies.\nThe context is affected by historical events, and by the country’s leadership. Many stakeholders shape the environment and the institutions, or “rules of the game”, that affect business. Labor, students, farmers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the military play a crucial role, making the analysis of country environments complex and fascinating.\nWe will study Japan in some depth, and catch brief glimpses of South Korea, Singapore, Chile, Turkey, India, South Africa and the former Soviet Union, to appreciate the forces that influence diverse country environments, and companies’ strategies.\nThe course will review aspects of global institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which set global rules that profoundly affect business strategy and human welfare. It will also explore opportunities and challenges at the bottom of the pyramid, the last frontier for value creation by companies and NGOs.\n",

    "description": "Le théâtre classique du 17e siècle passe pour le sommet de l’art du théâtre en France. Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde.\nPour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du « théâtre moderne » depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du «siècle de Louis XIV» (2e moitié du 17e siècle).\nNous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression «théâtre classique», les fondements du système qui a vu naître les « règles classiques », les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur « l’alexandrin classique ». Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période.\nEnfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français.\nPièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine.\nCes textes sont tous disponibles en éditions de poche (choisir de préférence «Folio classique” et «Folio Théâtre» ou «Le Livre de poche Classique». On peut les lire aussi en ligne sur le site: http://www.theatre-classique.fr/pages/programmes/PageEdition.php\nNous vous invitons à découvrir avec nous d’où viennent ces trois auteurs, comment ils se sont construits, comment ils se sont distingués des plus brillants dramaturges de leur temps. Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des «règles» et l’usage du vers dit «alexandrin», en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.\n",

Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform.\nThis course builds an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy.\nIn the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies.\nWhether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies.\nYou are welcome to join us in this exciting course!\nEnergy Subsidy Reform is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.\n",

    "description": "This introductory global health course aims to frame global health's collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways.\nThe course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:\nA global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.\nA foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.\nAn ethical engagement. Throughout the course, learners will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Learners will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities.\nA sense of inspiration and possibility. While the overwhelming challenges of global health could all too easily engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, learners will observe that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world’s poorest and suffering people.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.

    "description": "Do you want to become an expert at structural analysis?\nFinite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool. FEM is an effective numerical technique for partial differential equations (PDEs) in engineering. The fact that modern engineers can obtain detailed information for structural, thermal, electromagnetic problems with virtual experiments largely gives credit to FEM. The finite element method provides infinite possibilities for engineering, and this course provides a detailed introduction of FEM and its applications in engineering and beyond.\nThis course is divided into 15 lessons, which introduce basic equations of mechanics, mathematical principles of FEM, realizations in both discrete and continuum structures, various applications in engineering and skills at modeling with FEM software. Examples are demonstrated with MATLAB and ANSYS.\n",

    "description": "Principles of Electric Circuits (20220214x) is one of the kernel courses in the broad EECS subjects. Almost all the required courses in EECS are based on the concepts learned in this course, so it’s the gateway to a qualified EECS engineer.\nThe main content of this course contains linear and nonlinear resistive circuits, time domain analysis of the dynamic circuits, and the steady state analysis of the dynamic circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Important concepts, e.g. filters, resonance, quiescent point, etc., cutting-edge elements, e.g. MOSFETs and Op Amps, etc., systematic analyzing tools, e.g. node method and phasor method, etc., and real-world engineering applications, e.g. square wave generator and pulse power supply for railgun, etc., will be discussed in depth.\nIn order to facilitate the learning for students with middle school level, we prepare the necessary knowledge for calculus and linear algebra in week 0. With your effort, we can show you the fantastic view of electricity.\n\nFAQs\nI don’t speak Chinese, can I take the course?\nEven though the instructors are from China, this course provides all English teaching materials, including dubbed videos, quizzes, exercises, discussions, and Wiki terms. According to the questionnaire concerning the quality of these materials in the fall term of 2014, more than 90% students thought them \"very helpful\" or \"helpful.\" So technically, it's a English course on electric circuits.\nWhat are the textbook and the reference books for this course?\nThere is no textbook requirement for this course. The handouts distributed every week are critical. The following books are references ranked in the order of our lecturers’ preference:\n\n\nAgarwal and Lang, Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits, Morgan Kaufmann, 2005\n\n\nUlaby and Maharbiz, Circuits, 2009, NTS Press\n\n\nNilsson and Riedel, Electric Circuits 9th, Prentice Hall, 2010\n\n\nAlexander and Sadiku, Fundamentals of Electric Circuits 5th, McGraw-Hill, 2012\n\n\nHayt, Kemmerly, and Durbin, Engineering Circuit Analysis 8th, McGraw-Hill, 2011\n\n\nWhat is the grading breakdown?\n\n   20% quizzes\n   30% exercises\n   50% final exam\n\nHow can I get the certificate?\nIf your final score is no less than 50.\nWhat is the content arrange for the course?\n\nWeek 0 is for the pre-study or review of the knowledge in calculus and linear algebra, which will be used in this course.\nWeek 1-7 are on resistive circuit analysis.\nWeek 8-10 are on time domain analysis of the dynamic circuits.\nWeek 11-14 are on steady state analysis of the dynamic circuits with sinusoidal excitations.\nWeek 15 is for self-review and group discussion.\nWeek 16 is for exam.\n\nDoes the course contain the simulation?\nSure. The simulation is frequently used in the teaching videos and the exercises. The company National Instruments is so kind as to distribute free licenses for student version of the simulation software Multisim with six weeks of valid period, which is enough for your study. After you register the course, the downloading page will be provided in the course webpage in week 1.\nI’ve learned the course of circuits. I’m only interested in some parts of the course. How can you help me?\nWe provide a very helpful tool in the syllabus of the course. While listing the concepts, tools, and applications of circuits with the procedure of the course, we provide a Flash embedded in the webpage. You can click the interesting knowledge point. It will automatically generate a learning path accordingly. You are encouraged to learn through this path, which is quick and sufficient.\n",

    "description": "This physics course offers a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation. In this first module of three you will review the basics of wave mechanics and be introduced to the variational principle. You will learn about the technology of spin one-half states and spin operators and get an in-depth look into linear algebra to establish the mathematical foundation necessary to do quantum mechanics. This course concludes by developing the bra-ket notation of Dirac.\nTo follow this course you will need some basic familiarity with quantum mechanics. You must have seen the Schrödinger equation and studied its solutions for the square well potential, the harmonic oscillator, and the hydrogen atom. You must be proficient in calculus and have some knowledge of linear algebra.\nCompleting the 3-part Mastering Quantum Mechanics series will give you the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics.\nPart 1: Wave Mechanics,\nPart 2: Quantum Dynamics\nPart 3: Entanglement, and Angular Momentum.\nThe series will follow MIT’s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors. \n \nLearner Testimonial\n“I’ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I’ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can’t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.”\n “Being an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.”\n",

As Asian economies expand and become more involved in the global economy, a lingua franca – a language used to communicate among groups of people who do not share a mother tongue – is needed to exchange information. This course has two goals. The first is to introduce non-native speakers of English to methods for developing spoken English language and communication skills for doing business in Asia. The second is to examine the impact of interculturality and globalization on English communications. By exploring and participating in a business simulation set in Asia, you will develop the principal skills for effective communication in English when conducting business in China and other Asian countries.\n",

    "description": "Albert Einstein has become the icon of modern science. Following his scientific, cultural, philosophical, and political trajectory, this course aims to track the changing role of physics in the 20th and 21st centuries. This history course addresses Einstein's engagement with relativity, quantum mechanics, Nazism, nuclear weapons, philosophy, the arts, and technology, and raises basic questions about what it means to understand physics in its broader history.\r\n \r\nParticipants in the course will follow seventeen lessons, each of which will present a mix of science (no prerequisites!) and the broader, relevant cultural surround.  Some weeks will examine the physics concepts, while others will see excerpts of films or discuss modernist poetry that took off from relativity. Or we might be looking at the philosophical roots and philosophical consequences of Einstein’s works.  At other times we will be fully engaged with historical and political questions: the building, dropping, and proliferation of nuclear weapons, for example. \r\n \r\nTypically, in a lesson (about an hour of streamed material), there will be opportunities for individual mini-essay writing, some multiple choice questions to bolster your understanding of the science, and a group activity which might one week be a debate and another a collective commentary on elements of an artwork from 1920s Weimar Germany.   \n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

Companies need supply chain experts to create and maintain a strategic competitive advantage. This course is the first course offered as part of MIT's MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management.\nThis supply chain management course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.\nThe main topic areas we will focus on are:\n\n\nDemand Forecasting, Planning, and Management\n\n\nInventory Planning, Management, and Control\n\n\nTransportation Planning, Management, and Execution\n\n\nWhile our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.\nThe MITx MicroMasters Credential is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting and growing field. In addition to being a stand-alone certificate demonstrating expertise in the field, students who complete all of the required courses and the final proctored exam will be qualified to apply to gain credit at MIT for the blended graduate master's degree program. In order to qualify for the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management you need to earn a Verified Certificate in all of the required courses. When you register for a Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to additional practice problems, supplemental readings, and opportunities for increased interaction with the faculty and teaching staff. \n",

    "description": "This course covers the physics, concepts, theories, and models underlying the discipline of aerodynamics. A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.\nThe intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.\n \nFAQ\nIs there a required textbook?\r\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.\nCan I still register after the start date?\r\nYou can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.\nHow are grades assigned?\r\nGrades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice \"Concept Questions \" completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.\nHow does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?\r\nVideo lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\r\nYes, transcripts of the course will be made available.\nWill the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?\r\nYes, all the material will be made available to all students.\nWhat are the prerequisites?\r\nThe student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.\nWho can register for this course?\r\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n",

This course follows a modern dynamical systems approach to the subject. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques.\nMATH226 is essentially the edX equivalent of MA226, a one-semester course in ordinary differential equations taken by more than 500 students per year at Boston University. It is divided into three parts. MATH226.1 is the first of these three parts.\nIn MATH226.1, we will discuss biological and physical models that can be expressed as differential equations with one or two dependent variables. We will discuss geometric/qualitative and numerical techniques that apply to all differential equations. When possible, we will study some of the standard symbolic solution techniques such as separation of variables and the use of integrating factors. We will also study the theory of existence and uniqueness of solutions, the phase line and bifurcations for first-order autonomous systems, and the phase plane for two-dimensional autonomous systems. The techniques that we develop will be used to analyze models throughout the course.\nFor additional information on obtaining credit through the ACE Alternative Credit Project, please visit here.\n",

As Forster’s most romantic and optimistic book, A Room with a View is considered one of the top 100 English language novels of all times. An award-winning film adaptation of this novel came out in 1985.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\n",

Then, we’ll learn the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest – using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we’ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.\nThis course will consist of:\n\nInstructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics.\nGuided questions to help your understanding of the topic.\nWeekly tutorial videos for using R Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets.\nWeekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge.\n\nIn this first of a two part course, we will cover basic Descriptive Statistics – learning about visualizing and summarizing data, followed by a “Modeling” investigation where we’ll learn about linear, exponential, and logistic functions. We will learn how to interpret and use those functions with basic Pre-Calculus. These two “units” will set the learner up nicely for the second part of the course: Inferential Statistics with a multiple regression cap.\nBoth parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).\nJoin us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them? And what do those answers tell us about the world we live in?\nWant to learn more?

    "description": "Con este curso, el alumnado será capaz de aprender y entender los conceptos básicos de visión por computador, además de  implementar de forma práctica algoritmos de análisis de imágenes a través de computadores utilizando la biblioteca de funciones OpenCV.\nEl Análisis de Imágenes o Visión por Computador es la capacidad de los ordenadores de analizar imágenes capturadas por una cámara y obtener la información de los objetos que se hayan presentes en esa escena. En la actualidad, constituye uno de los campos de la Inteligencia Artificial con un mayor ritmo de desarrollo y que más aplicaciones nuevas está presentando.\nHasta hace pocos años las cámaras digitales solo estaban implantadas en el ambiente industrial. Allí se utilizan con dos fines:\n\nLograr una mayor interacción entre los robots industriales y el entorno que los rodea.\nConseguir un control de calidad total de los productos fabricados.\n\nCon la aparición de nuevo hardware, cámaras y algoritmos, el mundo de la Visión por Computador ya no se centra exclusivamente en el ambiente industrial sino que se extiende a los smartphones, la industria del videojuego e incluso a los coches.\nOtra característica que ha cambiado recientemente es que hasta hace poco tiempo las técnicas de análisis de imágenes eran accesibles solamente a un reducido número de especialistas. Los programas que se utilizaban eran costosos, con poca documentación y que exigían equipos informáticos de gama alta. Esto es ahora muy distinto; en concreto la biblioteca OpenCV, que se verá en el curso, constituyen una solución de altísimo nivel, gratuitas, portables a diversos sistemas operativos y equipos, ordenadores o teléfonos inteligentes y que constituyen de facto un estándar en la comunidad científica.\nPara que el alumnado pueda realizar diversas aplicaciones relacionadas con la Visión por Computador, a lo largo del curso se revisan los tipos básicos de elementos y sensores, viéndose las ventajas e inconvenientes de cada uno de ellos, así como las técnicas más usuales de procesar la información que proveen. A partir de dicho procesamiento de la información y de la extracción de características, se presentan diversos métodos para el reconocimiento de patrones.\n",

    "description": "The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.\nProbabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional \"theorem - proof\" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.\nThe course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:\n\nmultiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions\nlaws of large numbers\nthe main tools of Bayesian inference methods\nan introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)\n\nThe contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.\nCan I still register after the start date?\r\nYou can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.\nHow long does this course last?\r\nThe course starts on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 and ends on the due date of the final exam, on Thursday, May 26, 2015.\nWhat is the format of the class?\r\nThe course material is organized along units that are aligned with the chapters of the textbook. Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems.\nWhat textbook do I need for the course?\r\nNone - there is no required textbook. The class follows closely the text Introduction to Probability, 2nd edition, by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, Athena Scientific, 2008; see the publisher's website or Amazon.com for more information. However, while this textbook is recommended, the materials provided by this course are self-contained.\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\r\nVideo lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your own convenience. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.\nWill the text of the video clips be available?\r\nYes, we will provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos.\nHow are grades assigned?\r\nGrades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on the weekly homework assignments (11 total), two midterm exams, and a final exam.\nHow much do I need to work for this class?\r\nThis is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems. MIT students who take the corresponding residential class typically report an average of 11-12 hours spent each week, including lectures, recitations, readings, homework, and exams.\n",

    "description": "Politics of Freedom: The Civil War, 1861-1865 narrates the history of the American Civil War. While it examines individual engagements and the overall nature of the military conflict, the focus is less on the battlefield than on political, social, and economic change in the Union and the Confederacy. Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln’s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war’s long-term economic and intellectual impact. We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict.\nThis course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.\n",

    "description": "Did you know that cities take up less than 3% of the earth’s land surface, but more than 50% of the world’s population live in them? And, cities generate more than 70% of the global emissions? Large cities and their hinterlands (jointly called metropolitan regions) greatly contribute to global urbanization and sustainability challenges, yet are also key to resolving these same challenges.\nIf you are interested in the challenges of the 21st century metropolitan regions and how these can be solved from within the city and by its inhabitants, then this Sustainable Urban Development course is for you!\nThere are no simple solutions to these grand challenges! Rather the challenges cities face today require a holistic, systemic and transdisciplinary approach that spans different fields of expertise and disciplines such as urban planning, urban design, urban engineering, systems analysis, policy making, social sciences and entrepreneurship.\nThis MOOC is all about this integration of different fields of knowledge within the metropolitan context. The course is set up in a unique matrix format that lets you pursue your line of interest along a specific metropolitan challenge or a specific theme.\nBecause we are all part of the challenges as well as the solutions, we encourage you to participate actively! You will have the opportunity to explore the living conditions in your own city and compare your living environment with that of the global community.\nYou will discover possible solutions for your city’s challenges and what it takes to implement these solutions. Your participation will also contribute to wider research into metropolitan regions as complex systems.\nWe invite you to take the first steps in understanding the principles that will be essential to transform metropolitan regions into just, prosperous and sustainable places to live in!\nThis course forms a part of the educational programme of the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions and is developed by Wageningen UR and TU Delft, two of the founding universities of AMS Institute.\n",

Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.\nThis period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.\nThis course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last 5 weeks, with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.\nPart 1 introduces the basic philosophical, religious and scientific concepts that will be drawn upon throughout the course, and then goes on to cover early Shang and Zhou religious thought, the Analects of Confucius, the Daodejing (a Daoist text attributed to Laozi), the utilitarian thinker Mozi, the newly discovered and very exciting Guodian texts, and the momentous philosophical changes that occurred in the mid Warring States period.\n \nSee also:\nChinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 2\n",

    "description": "The transistor has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century – it enables the electronics systems that have shaped the world we live in. Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you!\nThis nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors.  It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device.\nThe course is divided into four units:\n\nTransistors fundamentals\nTransistor electrostatics\nBallistic MOSFETs\nTransmission theory of the MOSFET\n\nThe first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors.  The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors.  This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale.\nMy objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists.\nThis course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.\n",

    "description": "Learn how electronic gadgets are designed, developed, and built as embedded systems that shape the world.\nThis is a hands-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem solving, building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up.\nThis is the third time we have offered this course. Since the reviews have been overwhelmingly positive we do not plan major changes from the previous offering of the course. There are 14 labs, but students can pick and choose seven of them to achieve certification. The three labs that students found most rewarding were the finite state machine traffic light controller, generating sound using a digital to analog convertor, and creating a smart object using Wifi communication. This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.\nTo complete this course, you will be required to purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state-of-the-art ARM Cortex-M4 processor.\nWe will provide instructions about purchasing the kit and installing required software at: http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.\nFAQ\nHow will the Spring 2016 course be the same as the course run Spring 2015? \nThis course will be lab-based using the same Texas Instruments Tiva series TM4C123 LaunchPad and the set of extra components. We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification.\nHow will the Spring 2016 course be different from the course run Spring 2015? \nThis time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.\nIs this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin? \nYes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students.\nIs there a textbook associated with this class? \nThe class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required.\nDo I need a Windows PC? \nYes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac.\nHow much does it cost to take this class? \nIt does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee.\nHow much does the kit cost? \nIn the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab.\nCan I take this course without buying the kit? \nYes, there are three approaches to taking this class.\n\nYou could listen to the videos, read the assignments, and play with the interactive learning tools.\nThe second option involves installing the Keil uVision integrated development environment on a Windows PC, and performing the lab assignments in simulation mode.\nThe third option, which fully captures the essence of embedded systems, can be done by performing the lab assignments on a real system that you will purchase.\n\nCan I use another microcontroller? \nIf you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders.\nWhat does it mean for the display to be optional? \nIn the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion.\nWill this course really take 10 hours per week? \nThe first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week. The second option of performing the labs in simulation will take five or six hours per week. The third option of building and testing systems on the real microcontroller will require 10 hours per week.\nCan I take this course if I have never programmed before? \nAnyone is allowed register, but we believe to get the maximum benefit you should have prior programming experience at an introductory level. However, this could be your second class involving programming.\nCan I contact the Instructors or Teaching Assistants? \nYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. Instructors will monitor these forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases responses from other students will be adequate and faster.\nI really want to take this course, what is next? \nYou should purchase the microcontroller and extra electronics before the start of class. This class is available worldwide and we will provide region-specific methods to obtain the kit at http://edx-org-utaustinx.s3.amazonaws.com/UT601x/index.html.\n \n",

    "description": "Have you always wanted to write a novel? Have you started a novel only to run out of steam halfway through? Led by international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s world-renowned Creative Writing MFA program, this is the first in a series of courses designed to take your novel from concept to completion.\nOutlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You'll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers.\nIn the tradition of the UBC MFA program, this course draws on the work habits of established authors to help writers move quickly toward creating a blueprint for a successful draft. Whether you’re seeking literary fame or working on a project to share with family and friends, this course offers the tools and skills necessary to plan a novel others will be excited to read.\nThe course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel.\nFAQ\nDo I need to have started a novel to take this course?\nNo. However, you should have one or more novel ideas that you wish to work on during this course. We will ask you to start developing your idea right away.\nWhat if I’m in the middle of a novel?\nIf you have already started a novel, or are having issues with a partially finished manuscript without an outline, this course can help you clarify your intentions and work out structural issues. We believe the process of outlining helps writers understand a work in progress in a way that simply ‘writing through’ cannot.\nIs this course related to an existing UBC writing class?\nThis is an entirely new course, created by instructors with years of experience teaching the art of fiction writing to undergraduate and graduate university students as well as members of the community.\nWhat are the other courses in the series?\nHow to Write a Novel – Part 2: Writing the Draft will provide an essential fiction craft toolbox for writers struggling with the common hurdles of first drafts. How to Write a Novel – Part 3: Edit and Revise, is in the early stages of development. When it is launched, it will be suitable for students who have completed a full draft of their novel.\nImage credit:\nHow to fix the credit crunch by Jason Rogers is licensed under CC BY 2.0.\n",

What if we could improve preparedness over the world and limit the devastation caused by coastal disasters?\nThese are the questions we at Waseda University have been asking. Now we would like to share our experiences and achievements in disaster prevention with the rest of the world.\nIn this environmental studies course, you will learn about coastal disasters. Using worldwide field surveys, you will develop an understanding of the nature of tsunamis and storm surges. You will learn how coastal areas are attacked, understand how human lives are lost and infrastructure destroyed. Using numerical simulations and hydraulic experiments, we will present you with different scenarios, teaching you about the mechanisms behind a coastal disaster.\nYou will look at successful coastal disaster prevention concepts and methods. This will include defenses such as coastal dikes, as well as the implementation of essential evacuation plans. Ultimately, you will learn how to reduce the effects of coastal disasters and how to protect yourself and others if a disaster strikes.\nWhether you are an emergency management official, a city developer, an engineering student, or living in a potential natural coastal disaster community, this environmental studies course will teach you how we can improve disaster preparedness and management throughout the world.\n",

This includes coherence of single atoms for two-level systems and three-level systems, and coherence between atoms, which can result in superradiant behavior.\nAt MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.\nIn these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.\nCompleting the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.\n \nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\nCourse image uses graphic by SVG by Indolences.

You will gain an appreciation of natural disasters beyond the newspaper headlines, and will better understand how the effects of disasters can be reduced.\nThere is an urgent need for people from all walks of life to better understand the scientific principles behind the occurrence of natural disasters:\n\nCity planners need to know where, and where not, to site buildings.\nPoliticians need to make scientifically informed decisions.\nEmergency management officials need to understand the nature of a potential disaster and ways to mitigate such an event.\nJournalists need to report scientifically accurate information.\n\nLearner Testimonial:\n“Professors Stix and Gyakum have created and presented an engaging course, and have helped in my quest for a better understanding of the world around me.” – Previous Student\n",

    "description": "This college-level, calculus-based Introductory Newtonian Mechanics course covers all of the topics and learning objectives specified in the College Board Course Description for Advanced Placement®Physics C (Mechanics). It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle. These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities.\nOur emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving.\nIf you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this link, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort.\nFAQ\nHow long is this course?\nThe course consists of 13 weeks of required (graded) material and 2 weeks of optional (ungraded) material. You do not need to complete the optional weeks in order to receive a certificate, but we strongly encourage you to complete these units, especially if you are preparing for the College Board’s AP Physics C: Mechanics exam.\nIs there a required textbook?\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday, Resnick, & Walker, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).\nMy physics is a little rusty. How should I prepare for this course?\nIf you would like to brush-up on basic mechanics skills before taking this course, we recommend the brief warm-up course, On-Ramp to AP Physics C: Mechanics. \nWhat if I take a vacation?\nThe course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course content is always released at least 3 weeks ahead of the deadline, providing you with the opportunity for flexibility in scheduling.\nHow are grades assigned?\nThere are five parts of the course that are worth points: (1) Checkpoint problems are incorporated into the reading; (2) most weeks have an interactive lab component; (3) more involved homework problems occur at the end of each week and (4) quizzes at the end of every 1-2 weeks; (5) the course culminates in a final exam. Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem. A final grade of at least 60% is needed for certification; hence you will not have to do every problem.\n\nNote: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials\nThe RELATE group that authors and administers this course is a physics education research group. We are dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. In one of the only published studies measuring learning in a massive open online course (MOOC), we showed that a previous iteration of this course produced slightly more conceptual learning than a traditionally taught on-campus course. Currently, we are working to find just what caused this learning.  \nIn this course, the RELATE group will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administered to randomly assigned sub-groups of course participants. At certain points in the course, new vs. more traditional sequences of activities will be assigned to different sub-groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount of associated learning. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that all groups will have some new activities and some traditional ones.\nOur experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:\n\nWe will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). \nThe grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has slightly harder materials.\n\nNote: By clicking on the “Enroll Now” button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the sub-groups described above.\n",

We will emphasize approaches proven to be effective and show you how to implement them. We will also give you the opportunity to reflect on your own teaching experience and exchange ideas and share challenges with other learners in the course.\nWe will begin by looking at the most common method of teaching science, the lecture. We’ll discuss what the lecture method does well and look at data that illustrates when it is less effective. You will hear highly successful teachers talk about their experience with lecture and how they modified their lecture time to more actively engage students. We’ll investigate creating learning objectives and how they can be used to communicate your expectations to students. You will practice writing your own learning objectives and see how they can streamline exam construction. We’ll look at a variety of ways to include active learning during class time, discuss how active learning strategies support your learning objectives, and give you practice developing learning activities for biology topics you find challenging to teach. \nLastly, we’ll look at how to use resources for student learning outside of class, and how to know that your students have successfully learned from both in-class and outside of class activities.\nOur course is designed for instructors, or instructors-to-be, of undergraduate-level biology. High school instructors of AP Biology, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students looking ahead to teaching should find the course useful. The course can serve as a means of professional development. There are no pre-requisites, although prior satisfactory completion of a college biology course is highly recommended.\n",

    "description": "Many of today’s global challenges require tech-driven solutions -- climate change, the growth of the world population, cyber security, the increasing demand for scarce resources, digitalization, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world’s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree.\nSolving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds.\nWe need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the ‘me’ to the ‘we’. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders ‘sustainable leaders’.\nThis course has three parts:\n\n In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices.\nIn the second part, you will discover your “who am I” through personal and group exercises. You will create a “Personal Charter” that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life.\nIn the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to ‘sell’ yourself as a leader.\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Jane Eyre is a novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë. It was published in 1847 under her pen name, Currer Bell.\n\nJane Eyre is often referred to as a bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story. It follows the feelings and experiences of the protagonist and title character, Jane Eyre, from youth to adulthood.  The story has both elements of social criticism as well as a strong moral core. Many critics have considered this book to be ahead of its time, mostly due to Jane’s individualism, as well as story themes that include classism, sexuality, religion, and feminism.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

    "description": "The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.\nThis course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n",

    "description": "Creating software that works—as is—for people around the world requires thoughtful design.\nPeople speak different languages and the countries they live in standardize on different currencies, date formats—even envelope sizes. Colors have different symbolism depending on cultural norms. And to accommodate all these differences, you want to do everything you possibly can to avoid the colossal effort of redesigning and rebuilding a different edition of your software for each and every market.\nThis computer science course focuses on two aspects of “world-ready” design. The first is globalization: making the user experience and the code that implements it generic enough to accommodate most market differences. The second aspect is localization: customizing features for the local market. The more globalized your design, the easier it is to localize.\nThe course instructors include designers and programmers who have worked on globalization and localization of some of the world’s most successful software. They’ve experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly of creating world-ready software, and they’re here to ensure your software’s user experience is one all your customers will enjoy, regardless of where they’re from or what language they speak.\nPrevious programming or User Experience design experience is always helpful, but not necessary for this course. Completion of “Developing International Software” is also helpful, but not essential.\n",

Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication.\niSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure.\nStorage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage.\nData Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data.

The concept of two-photon transitions is relevant for Raman processes and light scattering.\nAt MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.\nIn these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.\nCompleting the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.\n \nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\nCourse image uses graphic by SVG by Indolences.

Which products should be recommended to an existing customer? Finding right answers to these questions can be challenging yet rewarding.\nPredictive analytics is emerging as a competitive strategy across many business sectors and can set apart high performing companies. It aims to predict the probability of the occurrence of a future event such as customer churn, loan defaults, and stock market fluctuations – leading to effective business management.\nModels such as multiple linear regression, logistic regression, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), decision trees, and neural networks are frequently used in solving predictive analytics problems. Regression models help us understand the relationships among these variables and how their relationships can be exploited to make decisions.\nThis course is suitable for students/practitioners interested in improving their knowledge in the field of predictive analytics.  The course will also prepare the learner for a career in the field of data analytics. If you are in the quest for the right competitive strategy to make companies successful, then join us to master the tools of predictive analytics.\n",

Achieving this aspiration demands highly skilled teachers and quality teacher education. \r\n \r\nThis course introduces teacher educators to Open Educational Resources – freely available learning materials that can be adapted for use in particular contexts.  The course explores how you can use OER in the design and delivery of your teacher education programmes to help you bring about the transformation of classroom teaching and learning.   Throughout the course there will be a particular focus on the OER generated by TESS- India. These innovative multi-lingual text and video OER (www.tess-india.edu.in) aim to support teachers in developing participatory approaches through modelling links between theory and practice in classroom activities.   You will explore the values and pedagogy underpinning teacher education OER from TESS-India and other repositories and learn how you can adapt and incorporate these OER for your own contexts and students. \r\n \r\nThrough participation in the course you will develop skills in locating, adapting and producing OER. Collaboration and the co-creation of OER will be key themes; you will be introduced to ways of working and open practices that you will be able to take forward into your professional working.  Through the course you may also form and strengthen your professional support network of fellow teacher educators. \r\n \r\nThe course is designed primarily for teacher educators working in the Indian context in both pre-service and in-service education with primary and secondary school teachers in formal and informal programmes. However it has significant application for teacher educators globally. \nAll course content is openly licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license.

This is the world of microorganisms. Microorganisms are everywhere, and although some are notorious for their roles in human disease, many play important roles in sustaining our global environment. We will explore these and in particular, those that thrive in the most extreme environments on our planet, the extremophiles.\nIn this course, we will discover how diverse life is on our planet and consider the basic principles that govern evolution. We will also learn how to classify organisms. One method is based on the different mechanisms that organisms utilize to conserve energy and obtain carbon. Another method is based on comparing sequences of common molecules present in different organisms. In the latter half of the course we will introduce the various extremophiles that have been not identified until now, and their basic characteristics. Finally, focusing on the thermophiles, we will study how proteins from thermophiles can maintain their structure and function at high temperatures.\n",

First, dipole and higher order couplings are introduced, and concrete examples for selection rules and matrix elements are given. After quantizing the electromagnetic field and introducing photons, the Jaynes-Cummings model and vacuum Rabi oscillations are presented. Coherent and incoherent time evolution are discussed, also in the framework of Einstein's A and B coefficients.\nAt MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.\nIn these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.\nCompleting the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.\n \nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application.

Learn to analyze the latest global trends so that you can adapt and cope with these changes in business and the world.\nThe new realities of the 21st century are disrupting the global financial architecture based on the U.S. dollar. Populations are aging. People are moving from the countryside to the cities. There are more people suffering from obesity than people who go hungry. The middle-class is growing fast in the emerging economies yet shrinking in Europe and the United States. The race for energy, natural resources, and food is intensifying.\nYou’ll learn about these and other global trends, and understand what the consequences are for markets, the business world, and society at large in this international management course from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. You’ll also learn how to analyze global trends, and to understand both their magnitude and relation to each other. Finally, you’ll discover how you can adapt and cope with these changes as they affect your business and society. \n",

    "description": "Hoy en día, más del 80 por ciento de la población en América Latina y el Caribe vive en zonas urbanas, y para el 2050 será casi el 90 por ciento. Esta creciente urbanización plantea desafíos importantes para los más de 15 mil municipios que existen en la región, exigiendo a los mismos hacer frente a las demandas de nuevos empleos, servicios urbanos, escuelas, transporte, viviendas y seguridad de forma consciente y planificada. Estas ciudades quieren avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible, buscando la manera de crecer económicamente, de forma inclusiva y respetando el medioambiente. ¿Pero cómo se avanza hacia el sueño de la sostenibilidad? ¿Cómo conseguimos crear actividad económica sin contaminar el aire y los ríos? ¿Cómo podemos crear riqueza y que los recursos lleguen a todas las personas? ¿Cómo hacer ciudades más seguras y participativas?\r\n \r\nPara reflexionar sobre estas y otras preguntas, el BID ha creado un curso que busca fortalecer en los participantes las capacidades para gestionar el desarrollo sostenible de las ciudades, a través del dominio conceptual, procedimental y actitudinal de las principales áreas de competencia de la ciudad y de la herramienta de la Iniciativa Ciudades Emergentes y Sostenibles del BID, permitiéndoles desarrollar habilidades y construir estrategias innovadoras y multisectoriales para dar respuesta a los desafíos de la sostenibilidad.\r\n \r\nPara conocer más detalles del curso haz clic aquí.\nLa preparación de este curso  fue financiada por el Fondo de Fortalecimiento de la Capacidad Institucional (ICSF), gracias al aporte del Gobierno de la República Popular de China.\n \r\n*This course is taught in Spanish.\n\r\nToday, more than 80 percent of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean lives in urban areas, and this figure will reach almost 90 percent by 2050. This growing urbanization poses significant challenges for the more than 15,000 municipalities in the region, requiring that they address demand for new jobs, urban services, schools, transportation, housing and security in a conscious and planned way. These cities want to progress toward sustainable development and find ways to ensure that economic growth is inclusive and environmentally friendly. But how can progress be made toward the goal of sustainability? How can we promote economic activities without polluting our air and rivers? How can we create wealth and ensure that resources are accessible to everyone? How can we make our cities safer and more participative?\n\r\nTo reflect on these and other questions, the IDB has developed a course aimed at strengthening participants' ability to manage the sustainable development of cities, through mastery of the concepts, procedures and attitudes of the principal areas of city competitiveness and the tool developed for IDB's Emerging and Sustainable Cities Initiative (ESCI). Through this course, participants will develop skills and create innovative, multi-sector strategies to address the challenges of sustainability.\r\n \r\nTo learn more details about the course click here. \nThe preparation of this course was financed by the Institutional Capacity Strengthening Fund (ICSF), thanks to the contribution of the Government of the People's Republic of China.\n",

    "description": "Entre 1950 e 2010, a taxa de urbanização da América Latina passou de 41% a 79%. Caso esta tendência se mantenha, a taxa de urbanização em 2030 será de cerca de 90%, fazendo da região a mais urbanizada do planeta.\nEssa tendência consolida a cidade como o centro do desenvolvimento econômico e humano da região. A cidade está criando trabalho, está inovando, está repensando seus sistemas de saúde e educação, transporte, está fazendo frente às mudanças do clima, está abrindo espaços para o debate e a socialização. Para que esse dinamismo possa traduzir-se em um fenômeno exitoso, a cidade deve aprender a planejar seu presente pensando em seu futuro, buscando o equilíbrio entre crescimento econômico, a inclusão social e o respeito ao meio ambiente. É, portanto, responsabilidade das cidades melhorar a qualidade de vida das gerações presentes sem comprometer o bem estar das gerações futuras.\nCom o objetivo de responder a este desafio, o BID criou um curso que busca fortalecer os conhecimentos e capacidades dos participantes em gerir o desenvolvimento sustentável de suas cidades. E para isso, o curso parte da premissa que a sustentabilidade das cidades só será alcançada por meio de uma perspectiva integrada e intersetorial; uma perspectiva integral, onde se trabalhe de maneira conjunta os desafios econômicos, fiscais, urbanos, ambientais, institucionais e de governabilidade das cidades junto com uma perspectiva intersetorial, onde as diferentes áreas e níveis de governo se coordenem e que se articulem com o setor privado e com a sociedade civil.\nCom o objetivo de entender melhor essa perspectiva, o curso analisa a situação, os desafios setoriais e intersetoriais que as cidades encontram na gestão das principais áreas de sua competência: finanças subnacionais, desenvolvimento produtivo, planejamento urbano, transporte, segurança cidadã, água, ar etc. Desta forma, com o objetivo de abordar o planejamento do desenvolvimento sustentável das cidades médias latino americanas, o curso apresenta a “Iniciativa Cidades Emergentes e Sustentáveis”, uma ferramenta de gestão que permite dar sentido ao trabalho analítico das dimensões/desafios de forma integrada.\nAssim como na América Latina e no Caribe, o Brasil possui grandes desafios ambientais, urbanos e fiscais para a sustentabilidade de suas cidades. Dentre eles se destacam os altos índices de violência - 25,8 mortes violentas por 100 mil habitantes segundo o Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública; a desigualdade urbana, uma vez que o país é o 4º mais desigual da América Latina e Caribe; e a vulnerabilidade diante de desastres naturais, onde se calcula, por exemplo, que a reconstrução das cidades cariocas devastadas pelas enchentes e pelos deslizamentos de 2011 custou 1,3% do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro; ou ainda, degradação ambiental, com um índice de 63% de esgoto sendo lançado nos corpos hídricos sem nenhum tratamento, segundo o MCidades.\nAlém de fornecer conceitos e uma visão abrangente da situação do Brasil em relação à sustentabilidade das cidades, neste curso serão abordados alguns desafios dos municípios, bem como exemplos práticos de como esses problemas estão sendo enfrentados.\n",

    "description": "Through the process of evolution, animals have developed their biological features and their cultures based on their surrounding environments. How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments.\nIn primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable.\nThis course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan. Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates.\nWe will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes.\nOur goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives.\nNo previous academic knowledge is required.

We often have a vision of the right policies or strategies for improving health, safety, and economic well being, but the real problem is getting things done. Even a simple policy intervention such as child vaccination requires much more than nurses and a stock of vaccine to be effective.\nCase studies are a vital tool for sharing insight about the how of policy implementation and institutional reform. They trace the steps taken to produce results, show solutions people have devised to address anticipated challenges and overcome unanticipated obstacles. Case studies help us think about how to adapt approaches so that they work in different contexts.\nThis social science course is most suitable for:\n\nPractitioners who want to document and analyze their efforts to implement a program or build a new institution\nResearchers who want to trace how programs achieved results\nGraduate students who want an introduction to one type of case study method\n\nNo certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.\n",

This introductory course seeks to enable you to understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these communication systems.  \r\n \r\nThis course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we examine the point-to-point link, which communicates information from a single transmitter to a single receiver. Part 2 examines how multiple transmitters can share the same physical channel. Part 3 discusses how information can be transmitted reliably from one station to another over a network that connects multiple stations. Online interactive exercises are included to help build your intuition.\n\r\nThis course was inspired by and built upon the course 6.02 Digital Communication Systems developed at MIT, which Prof Bertram Shi worked on during his sabbatical in 2009.\n",

    "description": "The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.\nThis course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!\nLearn more about our High School and AP Courses\n",

The challenge is how to deliver—how to create new practices, build new institutions, implement new policies, and transform incentives to sustain transformation and achieve sustainability.\nThis course is about the “hows” of generating institutional change in hard places. Each week we focus on a different kind of challenge. You will read a case study, examine a problem in detail, help create a “solutions\" toolkit, and then apply these insights to a second case.\nThe course introduces concepts and insights from applied political economy and the science of delivery. Topics include:\n\nReducing delay, error, and diversion of funds in citizen services\nUsing citizen monitoring and community-driven projects to improve services in rural areas\nPreventing conflicts of interest or self-dealing from blocking institutional reform; building trust and community and changing public expectations\nOvercoming capacity traps (what to do when brain drain, political turbulence, or other problems de-skill government)\nFacilitating coordination at the cabinet level\nDeveloping a strategy and the incentives to sustain change.\n\nDrawn from actual experience around the world, each case starts with the problems a reform leader faced and traces the steps taken to address these. You will have a chance to assess the process and decide whether the solutions might work in your own context, as well as offer new proposals.\nThrough quizzes and open response assignments, you will be able to share ideas with others and practice what you have learned.\nNo certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.\n",

You will then learn about how electric and magnetic fields shift atomic levels. The discussion of time-dependent electric fields prepares you for the interactions of atoms with light and for the dressed atom picture.\nAt MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.\nIn these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.\nCompleting the two-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.\n \nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\nCourse image uses graphic by SVG by Indolences.

    "description": "How do artists create visual effects? In order to create an artistic impression, artists select materials that allow image formation, and that lend color, emphasis, shape, and size to the object created.\nA scientist might follow up by asking, why those materials?  What characteristics do they have that allow them to embody the artist’s intent? How durable are they? Will they maintain the same qualities, both physical and aesthetic, they had when the work left the studio?\nConservation science further notes that all materials deteriorate over time, and then asks a follow-up question: What physical interventions are possible to maintain, preserve and protect the work as the artist intended? Whatever is done to the art object, the result must be to make the work recognizable as the artist’s work or the result is a failure.  \nThat is a key goal of this course: to understand, from a chemical point of view, how conservation protocols and the material aspects of an art work allow a better appreciation of an artwork and its creation, as well as confidence that it is the artist’s work.\nThese are not new problems. According to Leonardo da Vinci, the study of art should include the following topics:\n\nA knowledge of materials\nThe chemistry of colors\nThe mathematics of composition\nThe laws of perspective\nThe illusions of chiaroscuro\n\nAs the briefest study of Leonardo's life shows, he was clearly ahead of his time in wanting to understand the reasons for a vast array of natural and artificial phenomena. Even so, a thorough understanding of those subjects listed above still escapes us today – but, progress has been made and that progress is at once the subject matter and the goal of this course.\n\nCourse banner painting: Unknown (previously attributed to Vincent van Gogh), Poppies, c.1886-c.1887, oil on canvas, Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Bequest of Anne Parrish Titzell, 1957.617\n",

    "description": "Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.\nFunctional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.\nThis course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.\nOnce you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n",

    "description": "Le théâtre classique du 17e siècle passe pour le sommet de l’art du théâtre en France. Ses trois représentants les plus connus, Corneille et Racine pour la tragédie et Molière pour la comédie comptent parmi les plus grands dramaturges européens de tous les temps, et Molière reste l’un des auteurs les plus joués dans le monde.\nPour vous les faire découvrir, nous vous emmènerons dans l’environnement historique, sociologique, culturel et littéraire qui les a vu naître. Nous retracerons ainsi l’histoire du \"théâtre moderne\" depuis sa naissance au milieu du 16e siècle jusqu’aux plus brillantes années du \"siècle de Louis XIV\"(2e moitié du 17e siècle).\nNous examinerons ainsi les fondements de l’expression \"théâtre classique,\" les fondements du système qui a vu naître les \"règles classiques,\" les fondements d’un dialogue théâtral qui repose entièrement sur \"l’alexandrin classique.\" Et nous ferons apparaître les tensions créatrices (entre la théorie et la pratique, entre les règles et le refus des règles, entre le texte et le spectacle, entre le classicisme et le baroque, entre la tragédie et l’opéra) qui ont façonné le théâtre de cette période.\nEnfin, en vous accompagnant dans la lecture des quelques chefs-d’œuvre qui ont créé une rupture esthétique et marqué les esprits, nous vous ferons pénétrer avec nous dans l’atelier créateur des plus grands dramaturges de l’âge d’or du théâtre français.\nPièces de théâtre à lire: Le Cid et Cinna de Corneille / Les Précieuses ridicules, L’École des femmes et Tartuffe de Molière / Andromaque et Phèdre de Racine.\nCes textes sont tous disponibles en éditions de poche (choisir de préférence \"Folio classique” et \"Folio Théâtre\" ou \"Le Livre de poche Classique.\") \nNous vous invitons à découvrir avec nous d’où viennent ces trois auteurs, comment ils se sont construits, comment ils se sont distingués des plus brillants dramaturges de leur temps. Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des \"règles\" et l’usage du vers dit \"alexandrin,\" en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.\n \n \n",

First, you’ll learn how the Chinese World Order emerged in the ancient world, focusing on the concept of the \"heavenly mandate\" (天命) as the ultimate source of political power (1 module). You’ll also learn how the Chinese World Order expanded into the relationship between China and surrounding political entities (1 module) and several challenges when the Qing (淸) Empire replaced the Ming (明) Empire.\nSecond, this course will review how China tried to project its world order into the relationship with Korea and Korea came to be integrated into the Chinese World Order from the 14th century to the 18th century (4 modules). More specifically, it will show how China intervened in the interstate trade and Korean music. \nFinally, it will compare the two trajectories of political thoughts between Korea and Japan since 17th century. Korea fantasized itself as the genuine heir and center of the Chinese World Order, closing its door to foreigners. Meanwhile, Japan overcame the Chinese World Order and eventually converted itself as a modern state (1 module).\nThe working language is Korean with English subtitles.\n",

Thirty years ago, we knew only of the planets in our own solar system. Now we know of thousands circling nearby stars.\nMeanwhile, biologists have gained a strong understanding of how life evolved on our own planet, all the way back to the earliest cells. We can describe how simple molecules can assemble themselves into the building blocks of life, and how those building blocks might have become the cells that make up our bodies today.\nSuper-Earths And Life is all about how these two fields together - astronomy and biology - can answer one of our most powerful and primal questions: are we alone in the universe?\n\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.

    "description": "Over thirty years ago, confident in the superiority of American military power, the United States set out to \"fix\" the Greater Middle East. Since that time, U.S. troops, covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington's efforts have exacted a terrible toll, squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure. In the meantime, the Islamic world has become less stable while anti-American radicalism flourishes. America’s War for the Greater Middle East has failed, and that failure is irreversible.\nThis course offers a history of that war, for better understanding of the factors that inspired the United States to launch the conflict and to persist in a doomed enterprise. Inviting you to learn how the war unfolded from one phase to the next, from the era of Jimmy Carter to the age of Barack Obama, it catalogs the errors of judgment and implementation made along the way. Finally, it encourages you to consider alternative approaches to policy that might have better served the interests of the United States and of the people living in countries invaded, occupied, bombed and otherwise subjected to American punishment.  \n",

The story of Inanimate Alice, told through videos and instant messages. An ocean buoy tweeting remixes of Moby Dick. Welcome to the weird world of electronic literature—digitally born poetic, narrative, and aesthetic works read on computers, tablets, and phones. Experimental, evocative, and sometimes simply puzzling, electronic literature challenges our assumptions about reading, writing, authorship, and meaning.\nYet e-lit, as it is often called, has also profoundly influenced mainstream culture. Literature, film, comics, apps, and video games have all learned lessons from electronic literature. This course will trace the rise of electronic literature and explore both historic and contemporary works of e-lit. We’ll begin with electronic literature’s roots in avant-garde art and Cold War technology, and follow e-lit through the birth of the personal computer into the era of the Web and smartphone. At every step along the way the expressive power of new media—the way digital media enables and shapes different modes of creative and cultural expression—will be of particular interest to us.\n",

    "description": "Addiction is such a common problem today that clients experiencing alcohol, nicotine or other drug problems present in many different healthcare settings. The challenge of identifying effective ways to help people experiencing addiction is a serious one, and much depends on the quality of the clinical decisions we make. This course is intended to help you meet this challenge by increasing your understanding of the biology of addiction and the available treatment options in the different stages of the recovery journey.\nKey questions we will look at in this course include:\n\nWhy is it so difficult to change addictive behaviour?\nWhat kinds of treatment can help a person experiencing addiction?\nWhat is my role as a professional, either within or outside of addiction care?\nHow can I identify the best of the many options available?\nWhat evidence do I need to be able to make a sound decision about treatment?\nWhat approaches to addiction are proven to work around the world?\nWhat is the potential impact of my decisions on the life of a person experiencing addiction?\n\nThis course explores the “Recovery Pathway,” an easy-to-use framework for helping people with addiction move successfully from addiction to recovery. It will help you to plan a pathway through screening and assessment, to withdrawal and long-term relapse prevention. It will examine a range of psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted treatments. At each step of the pathway, you will review the biological basis of behaviour and treatment as well as evidence-based and service delivery considerations. It is an ideal starting-point for healthcare professionals who want to get to grips with potentially effective approaches to treating addiction, and need tools to make critical decisions.\n",

    "description": "A House Divided: The Road to Civil War, 1850-1861 begins by examining how generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union.  After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s. It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.\nThis course is part of the X Series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This X Series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.\nImage courtesy of Library of Congress\n",

This is an approach that more and more educators see as far more likely to ensure the success of Indigenous learners, as well as enhance the learning experiences of all students.\nChoosing reconciliation as a lens for rethinking policy and learning practices acknowledges that there are contradictions in the current curriculum of schooling that impact the success of Indigenous learners. Reconciliation in this course emphasizes changing institutional structures and personal and professional ideologies to create equitable and inclusive learning environments for Indigenous learners, and where all students should have opportunities to learn from Indigenous histories, traditions, and knowledges as part of a social justice education.\nEducators need to be able to respond to educational reforms that prioritize improved educational outcomes for Indigenous learners. In addition, educators must build the capacity of all learners to engage in relationships with Indigenous peoples based on intercultural understanding, empathy, and respect. To support these goals, teachers, administrators, young people, school staff, community-based organizations, and researchers will learn from Indigenous Elders, educational leaders, and culturally relevant learning resources as part of their experiences in this MOOC.\n",

Together, we will explore how to create sustainable interventions geared towards improving population health.\nThis course provides an interdisciplinary framework for understanding the place of water in health policy and engineering by delving into the complex social, economic, political and scientific factors that influence how we approach these critical health and water related challenges. \nWe identify threats to our water supply, including climate change, urbanization, agriculture and emerging contaminants. We lead a water sampling field trip and analyze the results in order to understand how water quality is assessed and regulated. We learn how to conduct a “Risk Assessment” as it relates to human and environmental health. The class will debate about issues such as water privatization, social and environmental justice and hydrofracturing. We’ll learn about point of use interventions for local interventions and take a field trip to the massive Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to see firsthand how large scale interventions are built and managed. Lastly, we will learn about various anthological determinants that drive the sustainability of interventions, review strategies for water management in developing and developed countries, and discuss the opportunities and challenges with implementing these solutions.\nIn addition to lectures hosted by Tufts Professors Dr. David M. Gute and Dr. Jeffrey K. Griffiths, the course features field trips, and guest lecturers comprised of renowned water professionals, entrepreneurs and scientists from the fields of public health, engineering, environmental science and health policy.\nWe hope that your ability to conceptualize and address water-related issues will advance as a result of the lecture content, in class demonstrations and global dialogues. To achieve this goal, we strongly encourage active participation and discussion with the professors, students and water professionals from across the globe. \nLastly, check out the content from The Biology of Water and Health – Fundamentals (PH241x), an archived course that provides a provocative introduction to topics such as the vital role of sanitation and hygiene, waterborne diseases, environmental epidemiology, and water contaminants.\nTufts University is proud to offer the two Biology of Water and Health courses (PH241x & PH242x) in partnership with the Open Education Consortium (OECx).

    "description": "Information Technology (IT) is everywhere. Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software.\nIn this new and improved version of the course, you will learn to write software with a progressive hint system for first time programmers. The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few “lines of code,” but writing quality programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches you to write good programs.\nThe course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.\nThroughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems to provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the Codeboard;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich). \nBeyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today’s IT-based world possible.\nIn this third edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises.\n\"Really good course. Followed it with a couple of experienced colleagues all of them having a computer science background. They really liked the concepts and programming in Eiffel a lot. Many thanks to the team making this course available! Can not wait to start with the advanced course!\" --Previous CAMSx Participant\n \nPrevious edition course evaluation:\nOverall course rating (1: worst grade, 6: best grade):\nGrade Resp.   %Resp\r\n1          1          2%\r\n2          0          2%\r\n3          3          6%\r\n4          9        18%\r\n5          20       40%\r\n6          17       34%\nTotal respondents: 50\r\nAverage: 4.96\n",

The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development.\nThe main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life.\nChemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born.\nChemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.\nThe purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a \"tourist spaceship\", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.\n",

You will deepen your understanding of the physics of resonance by examining systems using both classical and quantum techniques. Of special importance is the precession of a magnetic moments in time-dependent magnetic fields.\nAt MIT, the content of the five modules makes the first of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.\nIn these modules you will learn about the interaction of radiation with atoms: resonance; absorption, stimulated and spontaneous emission; methods of resonance, dressed atom formalism, masers and lasers, cavity quantum electrodynamics; structure of simple atoms, behavior in very strong fields; fundamental tests: time reversal, parity violations, Bell's inequalities; and experimental methods.\nCompleting the five-course sequence allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics.\n \nFAQ\nWho can register for this course?\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Cuba, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n \n\nCourse image uses graphic by SVG by Indolences.

(based on Scratch)\nComputing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer, to translate ideas into code.\nThis course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap! (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. This fun, introductory course is not just for computer science majors, it’s for everyone… join us!\n“I am so grateful to have experienced BJC (Beauty and Joy of Computing). I took this course during my freshmen year at UC Berkeley, and it has actually changed my life. Because of it, I have switched to the computer science major and have even developed a passion for computer science education! This course showed me that computer science is creative, and it gave me the confidence to continue taking computer science courses. BJC's philosophy of inclusion, diversity, and collaboration is tangible and sets it apart from all other computer science courses that I have experienced. It is truly empowering!” -- Yifat Amir\n \nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n \n",

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge.\nThe course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.\n",

However, this novel is most remembered for its depiction of health violations and unclean conditions in the American meatpacking industry.\n\r\nThese findings were based on an investigation Sinclair did as a journalist..  Sinclair spent several weeks gathering information while working in the meatpacking plants of the Chicago stockyards for the newspaper Appeal to Reason. The Jungle was first published in serial form in 1905 in the newspaper. A film version of the novel was made in 1914, but it has been lost.\n\r\nThe novel highlights working class poverty, the lack of social support, harsh living and working conditions, and a bleak outlook for the working poor. This is contrasted with the corruption of those in power.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support.

    "description": "Very often we see, hear or experience things that seem \"strange\" and incomprehensible to us. We start to wonder about the world around us, asking questions like: “How do certain people become billionaires when others are homeless? Why do humans worship Gods or form families? What makes killing in war acceptable but not in any other situation?”\nIf you have ever wondered about these issues and/or other, you aren’t alone. Similar questions have been asked since the beginning of history, and searching for objective answers using scientific research is the goal of sociology. \nThis course is designed to look critically and analytically through different sociological perspectives, including the functionalist, interactionist, conflict and feminist, to help us realize the extent to which society guides our thoughts and actions. The course material provides a fresh, new look at societies and cultures—more objective, full of inquiry and analysis, striving towards social justice and change. Sociology urges us to draw connections between public issues and personal problems, to see the strange as familiar and the familiar as strange, and to examine biography in a historical and social context.\nIssues of inequalities, social class, race, sexual orientation, disability, age and gender are critically examined within a global perspective in this course. You do not need any prior knowledge of sociological theories or methods to take this class.  Bring your life experiences and knowledge, and see how the Sociological Imagination will allow you to dispel cultural myths and reframe reality.\n\nThis course will cover topics found on the CLEP Sociology exam.\n",

    "description": "Developing software for one market, and shipping it internationally with a few tweaks is simply impossible. Learn how to  create “world-ready” software from expert programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies.\nDeveloping international software involves far more than translating the User Interface. You must sharpen your business acumen to determine whether shipping software to a specific market is even worth the effort. You must deepen your knowledge of cultural differences so you don’t include a feature, visual, or turn of phrase that offends potential customers. You must understand that differences in language affect input methods, sorting orders, text layout, fonts, and dialog box sizes, and that countries use different currency symbols, number formats, keyboard layouts, and measurement systems--and you should internalize all of this before you write a single line of code.\nIn this era of rapid development and intense competition, it is tempting to focus on what’s “most important” first, leaving the rest for later; but waiting until the end of the software development cycle to start thinking about markets outside of your own is a strategy that can result in delays or embarrassing failures, costing you time and money, alienating potential customers, and damaging your brand.\nIn this course, programmers who have developed international software for some of the world’s most successful companies will teach you the secrets to creating a “world-ready” software design and codebase that will make shipping software to markets around the world a smoother, less expensive, and less time-consuming process. The course has three discrete sections: business considerations, design, and development.\nNo previous programming knowledge is necessary for Part 1. Parts 2 and 3 require an understanding of basic coding techniques.\n",

Or how and why curators, historians, archivists, and preservationists do what they do?\nIn Tangible Things, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. This course will draw on some of the most fascinating items housed at Harvard University, highlighting several to give you a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.\nBy “stepping onto” the storied campus, you and your fellow learners can explore Harvard’s astonishing array of tangible things—books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The University not only owns a Gutenberg bible, but it also houses in its collections Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century “spirit writing” chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau’s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but also for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History Museum not only preserves dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.\nIn the first section of the course, we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard’s history, and you will learn the value of stopping to look at the things around you.\nIn the next section, we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.\nFinally, we will consider methods of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.\nAlong the way, you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.

It also addresses concepts such as women in Victorian culture, colonialism, sexuality, and post-colonialism. Although Stoker was not the first writer to tell the story of a vampire, he is credited for giving the vampire its modern form. This story has been adapted to many different forms in film and theater.\n\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence.

Why should this surprise us? Almost none of us has ever been taught how to be inventive.\nThis course is based on an extraordinarily successful program that has been presented at over 70 top American universities. Over the next 5 weeks Dr. Roberta Ness, an internationally renowned physician-scientist and an expert in innovative thinking, provides proven techniques to expand your originality. The method she will teach you is described by the acronym PIG In MuD: Define the problem, identify frames, generate all possible alternatives, incubate, meld to your best ideas, and disseminate. Your mascot will be Eggbert, an uptight, risk-avoidant pig who will learn a thing or two along with you. Along with Eggbert, you will sharpen your powers of observation, making surprising associations, expanding assumptions, pulling questions apart, and thinking backwards. Solving real-world problems in business and science, you will hone your creative thinking skills. In a final group project, you will be amazed by how creative you have become. Since the top projects will be voted up onto the home page and visible to all collaborating companies, you may even come across unique career opportunities when you and your ideas are “discovered.”\nThe funding for this course was made possible by the UTHealth Innovation in Cancer Prevention Research Training Program (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas grant #RP140103).

Emergen tendencias como la Responsabilidad Social Corporativa, vinculada a procesos de reporte estandarizado, como el que marca Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) y a mejoras en los esquemas de Gobernanza Corporativa, necesarias para armonizar los distintos ecosistemas tanto sociales como empresariales y ambientales garantizando la legítima participación de todas las partes interesadas y equiparando la información generada a la financiera a la hora de tomar decisiones.\n\r\nEn este escenario, los activos utilizados tanto por gobiernos como empresas para desarrollar deben ser administrados de manera eficaz y eficiente para incrementar el valor de las organizaciones de manera incremental y continua garantizando principalmente  la sostenibilidad económico financiera de esas organizaciones. Dentro de esos activos, la información y la TI adquieren valor importantísimo para facilitar  las necesidades de transformación de las organizaciones y, especialmente gobernar y gestionar el uso adecuado de la TI tal como señala la norma ISO/IECE 38500.\n\r\nEn cualquier caso, la implantación de éstas  tecnologías requiere un cambio profundo en la cultura de las organizaciones, públicas y privadas y la adopción de principios y políticas internas que impidan posibles perjuicios a todas las partes interesadas en el éxito de dichas organizaciones.\n\r\nLa aplicación de las distintas normas mencionadas así como  renovación del concepto de Gobernanza Corporativa aplicada a los distintos activos y especialmente a la TI (dirección y control en el uso y gestión de los mismos) es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrenta hoy el mundo económico financiero así como la generación de conocimiento e inteligencia para resolver los graves problemas de nuestros días y en el futuro.

    "description": "This course will provide fundamental knowledge in immunology as well as some advanced topics from cutting-edge research results, such as cancer immunotherapy and novel vaccine development.\r\n \r\nImmunity is the body’s system of protection from attack by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the “enemies of human life” have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.\r\n \r\nDuring this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications.  We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.\r\n \r\nThe part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.\r\nThe first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.\r\n \nProgram :\r\nWeek 1.

How are we alike and different in our impacts, depending on where we live; and how does civic and governmental attitude impact sustainability and resilience in the future? These questions will be explored on a global, local and personal level in this introductory course. Students will compare and contrast case studies from suburban Seattle to rural, mountainous China and consider their own significant impacts on ecology.\nTogether, we will go over the concepts of sustainability and resilience, and analyze your impact on our environment. For a global perspective, we will go over a case study of societal impacts. Our emphasis will be on translating theory to individual impact and comprehension.\nNo previous knowledge is needed.

    "description": "Ignorance! provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how people think about unknowns, how they deal with them, and how certain kinds of ignorance are enshrined in cultures and social institutions. Over 5 weeks, we’ll be taking you on a tour through ignorance in all its varieties and guises. Ignorance is everyone’s business. Ignorance is relevant to every discipline and profession, and to everyday life, both at work and at play. No matter what domain you study or work in, this course will have something to offer to you.\nWe will explore questions about ignorance such as: Where does ignorance come from? How do we impose ignorance on each other, and even on ourselves? And why? We usually think about ignorance as a bad thing, but can it be preferable not to know something? How do we use ignorance? What roles does ignorance play in social interaction, group relations, institutions, and law? Can ignorance sometimes be a virtue?  When can ignorance be good or bad for us? How can we harness the unknown for learning, discovery, and creativity? \nYour understanding of ignorance will be expanded via online games, discussion forums, opportunities to find out what your own “ignorance profile” is, additional readings, and Wiki materials. There also will be discussion threads specifically for those of you who want to apply understandings about ignorance to complex social and environmental problems. Knowing more about ignorance will help you to manage and work with it. It also will help you in dealing with the unexpected, and with complex problems.\n",

Ha habido numerosos episodios de recesiones profundas, crisis bancarias, inflación desbordada y escasez de divisas. Todos estos factores afectan la calidad de vida en América Latina. En realidad, sólo con mayores niveles de crecimiento sostenido a través del tiempo, es posible pensar que América Latina supere la pobreza y mejore el nivel de vida de la región.\nEste curso analiza los principales desafíos que la región enfrenta en cuanto a su crecimiento económico y estabilidad macro-económica. Los contenidos serán presentados en un lenguaje simple y comprensible para todos aquellos participantes que no son especialistas en el área temática.\nEste curso pretende abordar las siguientes preguntas:\n\n¿Cuáles son los desafíos que enfrentan los países en América Latina y el Caribe para incrementar sus niveles de inversión privada? \n¿Por qué la productividad en la región es más baja comparada con la de otras regiones?\n¿Cuáles son los principales desafíos que enfrenta la infraestructura, sea ésta la relacionada con agua y saneamiento básico, el transporte o la energía, para mencionar algunos sectores?\n¿Por qué los recursos naturales, que abundan en la región, no siempre han dado los resultados esperados para propiciar el desarrollo regional?\n¿Cómo se originan la inestabilidad económica y las crisis macro-económicas?\n\n¿Cuál es el rol de las políticas monetarias, cambiarias y financieras para alcanzar estabilidad macro-económica?\nLa preparación de este curso fue financiada por el Programa Especial para el Desarrollo Institucional (SPID) del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.  This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.\nEnvironmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:\n\nThe field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist\nThe human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment\nAgriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food\nNon-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each\nRenewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable “green” energy sources have impacts as well as benefits\nBiodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science\n\nEducation method\r\nThe course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, discussions, multiple choice and prompted discussions and one graded quiz per week.

    "description": "Turn back if you would see your shores again.\nDo not set forth upon the deep,\nfor, losing sight of me, you would be lost.\n-Paradiso, Canto II, lines 4-6\nJoy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than “Joy?” “Joy” boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates “nel mezzo,” at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return.\nFrom beginning to end, the Pilgrim’s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, la diritta via, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.\nDante’s Paradiso maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person’s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law—the law of relational identity, where “all are responsible to all for all.” Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.\nAlmost everyone agrees that the poetry of the Paradiso is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the Paradiso that unless we have become used to eat the “bread of Angels,” we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the Inferno. But to paraphrase Virgil’s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, “Why be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?”\nIn this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits\r\nas key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about the meaning of the poem at a personal level.  This module is the third of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the Vita Nuova and Inferno will launch on October 15, 2014, and a module on Purgatorio will launch in February 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC. The print editions contain valuable notes and commentary which are highly recommended as companions to the course materials.\r\n \n",

For the first time in human history, we know that planets around other stars not only exist, but are common!\nAlien Worlds focuses on the search and characterization of planets orbiting other stars (called extrasolar planets or “exoplanets”). Over the course of nine modules, we will learn some of the techniques used to discover the thousands of known exoplanets and will discuss how we can use basic scientific tools to characterize the sizes, masses, compositions, and atmospheres of exoplanets. We will also learn about the diversity of stars in the Galaxy to understand how stellar properties affect exoplanet detection techniques and influence planetary formation and habitability.\nIn addition to the exploration of exoplanets, students in Alien Worlds will gain a basic understanding of light, gravity and motion, and be introduced to some of the most extreme life on planet Earth. We will hear from experts at the forefront of exoplanet science and interact with other participants and instructors through social media and online tools.

    "description": "Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it’s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.\nThe purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. \nBy the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.\nCourse goal:\nThe goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:\n\npurposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,\npossesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,\nis compassionate towards self and others,\ndemonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and\nfocuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.\n\nCourse supporting objectives: When you complete this course, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\r\n\t\nExplain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life\n\n\nDirectly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\r\n\t\nMindfulness practices\nStrategies to manage intense emotions\nActivities that induce positive emotions\nClarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them\nMaking health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being\n\n\nDescribe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person\nDevelop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future\n\n",

The same identification was made about Israel in the Old Testament and the disciples of Christ at their baptism. The striking similarity of these titles establishes a tight interrelationship between the people Israel, the person of Jesus Christ, and the church.\r\n \r\nIn this course, we will explore how a close reading of the book of Genesis, the Gospels, and early Christian writers can shed further light on these relationships and, in so doing, deepen our understanding of the figure of Jesus Christ.  Unlike many other treatments, this course does not presume that Jesus’ character can be plumbed solely by an examination of the Gospel stories. The witness of the Jewish scriptures and the lives of the saints are also important sources for this task.\r\n \r\nThe course will be eight weeks in length and organized around three topical questions:\r\nWho is Israel? (primary source material: the book of Genesis)\r\nWho is Jesus? (primary source material: the Gospels and the Creeds)\r\nWho is the Church? (primary source material: a selection of post-Biblical Christian writers)\r\n \r\nNo matter what your background in the study of theology, this course will provide a fresh approach to the identify of Jesus Christ that will reveal how the church has explored the unmeasurable depths of his person.\n",

    "description": "In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. \nIn this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:\n\n3D geometry,\nprobabilistic state estimation,\nvisual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,\nlinear control.\n\nIn particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.\nThe course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python.\nThis course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.\nFAQ\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\nNo, all required materials will be provided within the courseware. However, if you are interested, we recommend the following additional materials:\n\nThis course is based on the TUM lecture Visual Navigation for Flying Robots. The course website contains lecture videos (from last year), additional exercises and the full syllabus: http://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ss2013/visnav2013\nProbabilistic Robotics. Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard and Dieter Fox. MIT Press, 2005.\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications. Richard Szeliski. Springer, 2010.\n\nDo I need to build/own a quadrotor?\nNo, we provide a web-based quadrotor simulator that will allow you to test your solutions in simulation. However, we took special care that the code you will be writing will be compatible with a real Parrot Ardrone quadrotor. So if you happen to have a Parrot Ardrone quadrotor, we encourage you to try out your solutions for real.\n",

    "description": "Homer’s account of the Trojan War in the Iliad explores the effects of warfare upon Greeks and Trojans alike. It illustrates not only the challenges that the combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victims– women, children, and the elderly. Though the Iliad is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptions of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically, poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal.\r\n \r\nThis course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different. Intense suffering and horrific acts are inevitable. However, the mode of fighting, the resources, the arms, the equipment, the treatment of prisoners, the command structure, and the ideology driving men and women to fight all differ.\n",

    "description": "The concept of a Smart City holds much promise for improving the quality of life for city dwellers, but what exactly do we mean by “Smart City?” It means aligning information technologies to citizens’ needs in order to enhance their day-to-day lives by increasing efficiency, lowering costs, and engaging more directly with city dwellers. Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the key performance indicators that are essential to improving the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.\n\r\nOnce participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance. A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation. Participants will also be able to define and establish the necessary metrics to measure the performance of a Smart City.\n",

    "description": "WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?\r\nMechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.\nThis is the third in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 3 focuses on the movement of oscillating systems and the propagation of waves (sound, seismic, or surface-water). Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 2 examined angular motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?\r\nYou need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.\nThere is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.\n",

    "description": "When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect.  You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data.  Statistics can be confusing and opaque.  Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful.\nBut in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it—from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information?  One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.\r\n \r\nThe purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach—you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.\r\n \r\nYou do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.\n\r\nBy the end of the course you will be able to:\n \n\nIdentify the most important features of a data set\nSelect a statistical test based on the features of the data\nThink like a statistical detective\nUnderstand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables\nPerform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data\nHopefully, love stats! \n\nWe’ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.\n",

Is the suffering involved in meat, egg and dairy production bad enough that you should go vegan? How do your food choices affect the economy and the environment? Should you become a locavore? Should you eat only sustainably produced, \"farm to table\" food? Or is factory-farmed food more efficient and ultimately better for the environment?\nWe also face difficult food-related questions at the political-social level. Should states restrict their citizens' food choices so as to encourage healthy eating? Should governments grant patents on genetically modified crops? And how do we, as a society, implement effective food policies for a rapidly expanding world population?\nThis class will provide the tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on these challenging questions.\nOur goal is to provide a working understanding of some leading ethical theories as well as the central empirical issues related to food production, distribution and consumption.

Connect with the course team and fellow learners on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/HKUxArchitecture\nThis 5-week introductory course is for those who would like to explore and be fascinated by vernacular architecture – the subject and study of everyday buildings, landscapes and sites which are not designed by professional architects but “ordinary” practitioners. It explores vernacular architecture as an expression of local identity, indigenous traditions, and assimilation of different cultures.\nThis course covers topics such as native building materials, the interaction between people, culture and the vernacular, as well as the vernacular landscape. It has a special emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, which allows students to take a closer look at examples in diverse locales, such as the leather yurts in Mongolia, timber houses in Japan, brick, mud and straw houses in India, reinforced concrete fortified towers and grey brick courtyard houses in Southern China including Macau and Hong Kong.\nDesigned to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course challenges the perception of tradition and stimulates a deeper analysis of one’s local environment. Indeed, we are keen to hear about how you link your new understanding to vernacular architecture in your neighborhood.\nThose who wish to extend their experience and exploration please also join our subsequent 5-week course The Search for Vernacular Architecture of Asia, Part 2 in Summer 2015.\n",

    "description": "This course is offered in an experimental format. Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.\nMany early childhood educators report feeling ill equipped to meet the needs of children with challenging behavior and frustrated in their attempts to develop safe and nurturing early learning environment. If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children’s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.\nThe overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.\n",

    "description": "The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.\r\n \r\nIn the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.\r\n \r\nOverall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.\r\n \r\nThis course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.\r\n \nSample comments:\r\nFrom Roald Hoffmann, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Hoffmann\r\nCornell University\n \"… the pedagogical imperative in research is very important to me, and so I really value a kindred spirit. Your (Datta's) online courses are just wonderful!\"\r\n \r\nFrom anonymous student in previous offering.\n\"The course was just awesome .. Prof. Datta's style of delivering lecture is mind-blowing.\"\r\n \r\nThis course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering. These courses focus on cutting-edge topics distilled into short lectures with quizzes and practice exams.\n",

    "description": "Now I shall sing the second kingdom,\nthere where the soul of man is cleansed,\nmade worthy to ascend to Heaven.\n-Purgatorio, Canto I, lines 4-6\nWhile Hell is “black, confined, stinking, noisy, and suffocating, the great Mountain of Purgatory rises in pure sunlit solitude out of the windswept southern sea.” (Sayers, Purgatorio; Introduction)  Dante has undergone a conversion which has, literally, turned his world upside down.\nSadly, the majority of Dante’s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a “school of contemplation,” where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one’s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante’s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a “whole person” more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante’s Purgatorio.\nFor us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the Purgatorio is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante’s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.\nIn this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about the meaning of the poem at a personal level. This module is the second of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the Vita Nuova and Inferno will launch on October 15, 2014, and the concluding module on Paradiso will launch in April 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC. The print editions contain valuable notes and commentary which are highly recommended as companions to the course materials.\n",

Over six weeks we’ll get a sense of how some individuals answer these questions, and you’ll get the tools you need to explore these questions for yourselves.\nWe will start our time together with some basic assumptions, the most important being a willingness to think about Hip Hop and religion as cultures that wrestle with the huge questions of our existence: Who are we? Why are we? Where are we?  on hip You will also need to be open to the possibility of Hip Hop as a language through which these complex and religious questions are presented, explored, and interpreted.\nAs this course unfolds, we’ll look closely into the relationship between Hip Hop culture and religion. We will explore the ways in which Hip Hop culture discusses and provides life meaning in complex ways through  (1) a discussion of the history and content of rap music; (2) an examination of religion in rap music; (3) an exploration of the religious sensibilities of rap artists; and (4) a discussion of the implications of the connection between rap and religion.\nWe will accomplish this through a unique mix of videos, readings, music, images, stories and behind-the scenes insider perspectives. \nAll required readings are available within the courseware and complete texts are also available for purchase.\nJoin this course to enhance your understanding of the intersections between religion and Hip Hop culture in the United States.

    "description": "Perhaps no story is as essential to get right as the history of capitalism. Nearly all of our theories about promoting progress come from how we interpret the economic changes of the last 500 years. This past decade’s crises continue to remind us just how much capitalism changes, even as its basic features—wage labor, financial markets, private property, entrepreneurs—endure. While capitalism has a global history, the United States plays a special role in that story. This course will help you to understand how the United States became the world’s leading economic power, revealing essential lessons about what has been and what will be possible in capitalism’s on-going revolution.\n\nFAQ\nDo I need to have taken economics before?\r\nNo. Though there will be discussion of economic ideas, professors will assume no prior economic training.\nI am not familiar with American history, but I am interested in how capitalism works. Can I take this course?\r\nYes. We will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. history to take the class.\nIs this class about economic thought like Smith, Marx, Ricardo, Hayek, etc.?\r\nThis class is primarily about what actually happened rather than theories of what happened. While we will touch on important economic thinkers, this class will focus more on the people and institutions that developed capitalism in the United States. If you want to know how capitalism works and came about, this is the class for you.\nWill certificates be awarded?\r\nYes. If you complete the work and achieve a passing grade in the course, you can earn a Honor Code Certificate, which indicates that you have completed the course successfully. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of CornellX, designating the institution from which the course originated.\nWhat will help me complete this course?\r\nWe have found that the best help you can get is other people in the real world. Enlist friends, co-workers, family, and other people to take the class with you. Ask your friends on Facebook or Twitter. Arrange a time during a lunch break or an evening to discuss the week’s videos and readings. Think of this “MOOC club” like a book club! You will get more out of the material and be much more likely to finish.\nI want to read more about American Capitalism!\r\nProfessors Baptist and Hyman just wrote a course reader expressly for this MOOC (though it is also being taught at Cornell University).\nContaining every reading from the MOOC, as well as additional readings from leading scholars (that could not be had for free!), this course reader provides the student with more background for every topic.\nEach reading is introduced and discussed by the professors. Each reading, as well, has additional questions for the student to discuss with their friends.\nAre there prerequisites?\nThis course is designed to be accessible for people without a strong background in U.S. history. Nevertheless, we make reference to many people, locations, events, or developments that may be unfamiliar to some students. Below are sources for additional information.\nWikipedia is a very helpful source for a quick definition or description of most of the material in this course. It can help you answer most factual questions you might have.\nDigital History is a website that can serve as an online text book if you need a stronger grounding in U.S. history.\nFor more difficult questions, you can post a question on the discussion board where your fellow students may be able to help you.\nAn e-book has been designed for this class, containing all the readings and some additional essays by leading scholars in the history of capitalism, including the professors.

    "description": "Technological innovations have revolutionized the way we view and interact with the world around us. Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?\nStudents will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).\nPart 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.\nPrerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.\n",

    "description": "This course, the fourth installment of the multi-part Poetry in America series, explores the poetry of Emily Dickinson, one of America’s most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime.  Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson’s poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles “Lil Buck” Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.\r\n \r\nLed by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

    "description": "WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?\r\nMechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.\nThis is the second in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 2 expands on Part 1 by considering the rotation of objects, connecting new concepts of angular momentum and torque to the properties of linear motion. Part 1 examined linear motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion. This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?\r\nYou need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.\nThere is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.\n",

    "description": "At the founding moment of American democracy, we the people established an historic mechanism to have power over our government.\nThe jury is an institution in some legal systems in which a panel of citizens weigh evidence and decide verdicts of court cases. “To jury” is, at its most basic form, to judge. It is an exercise in the deliberation of issues, persuasion, and the polling of results. JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion.\nThe course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.\nDeliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous.  Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be ‘Unhangout,’ a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab. Many other opportunities for gathering, deliberating, and returning results are also available, including face-to-face gathering and asynchronous deliberation online using open social media like Facebook and Loomio.\nJuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is ultimately about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication. By listening, speaking, persuading, and being persuaded, you will learn about yourself and your jury in relation to others.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.

    "description": "PHYS 102x serves as an introduction to electricity and magnetism, following the standard second semester college physics sequence. Part 2 begins with the nature of the magnetic field and how it is created by current distributions and magnetic materials. Next, Faraday’s law of induction is described, as well as some of its applications and interesting effects. Finally, inductors and AC circuits are covered, including RLC circuits, reactances of circuit elements, and resonance. PHYS 102.2x consists of 5 weekly learning sequences, each with ~1.5 hours of video lectures, conceptual lecture problems, and online homework questions. The course concludes with an online exam during the 6th week.  \nFAQ\nWhat are the prerequisites?\r\nWe will assume that you are familiar with vectors, that you know how to calculate integrals, and that you have had introductory mechanics. These topics will be briefly reviewed as needed, but not in a systematic way. If you have not had classes in these topics it may be possible to complete the course with extra study.\nWhat textbook is required?\r\nThe course will not strictly follow or make assignments from a specific textbook.  Any recent freshman physics textbook will suffice. Reading assignments will be given by topic, including links to several free online physics textbooks.\n",

American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release. This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison’s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College's Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.\n",

    "description": "东南亚在中国之南，且濒临海洋，所以古代把它称为“南海”或“南洋”。“东南亚”这个名称，是第二次世界大战期间才出现的。东南亚地区很早就有人类 活动，并在公元前后形成了原始的文化形态，主要表现在东南亚的岩画、巨石、瓮葬和铜鼓等特色鲜明文化遗迹。从公元3世纪开始，印度文化、中国文化、伊斯兰 文化和西方文化陆续进入东南亚地区，经历了长期的本土化过程，与东南亚的本土文化进行了充分的融合，形成了独特的文化形态和文化特点。\n\r\n1967 年，印度尼西亚、泰国、新加坡、菲律宾四国外长和马来西亚副总理在曼谷举行会议，发表了《曼谷宣言》（《东南亚国家联盟成立宣言》），正式宣告东南亚国家 联盟（简称“东盟”）成立。20世纪80年代后，文莱（1984年）、越南（1995年）、老挝（1997年）、缅甸（1997年）和柬埔寨（1999 年）5国先后加入东盟，使这一组织涵盖整个东南亚地区。\n\r\n由于中国与东南亚在地理位置上的相邻关系，奠定了东南亚地区在中国对外关系中的 “首要”地位。随着中国与东南亚交流层次的逐步深入，中国扩大了国际影响力，积累了丰富的开展国际交流的经验。但是，由于中国民众对于东南亚文化的了解程 度还有提升的空间，从而也在中国与东南亚的交流中造成了一定的问题。本课程将将系统梳理东南亚文化发展进程的基础上，以兼顾东南亚传统文化与现代文化的特 点，以具体的文化现象为中心，为同学们呈现东南亚文化的多样性与独特性。\r\n \r\n\"Southeast Asia\" is the term which appeared during World War II. In Chinese history documents, this region was called “Nan Yang” or “Nan Hai”. From the beginning of the 3rd century AD, Indian culture, Chinese culture, Islamic culture and Western culture have moved into this area. After a long process of localization, external culture and the native culture were fully fused, forming a unique cultural expression and cultural characteristics.\n\r\nIn 1967, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia issued \"Bangkok Declaration\" to declare the establishment of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established. After the 1980s, Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999) has joined the ASEAN, so that this organization covering the entire Southeast Asian region.\n\r\nAs the geographical neighbor of China, the Southeast Asian region plays \"top\" role in China's foreign relations. With the gradual deepening of exchanges between China and Southeast Asia, misunderstanding of cultures caused some problems. In order to improve the understanding of Chinese people about the neighbor countries, this course will show the development steps of Southeast Asian culture, and explain the traditional and modern culture features of Southeast Asia through the specific cultural phenomenons.\n教学参考书有哪些?\n吴虚领：《东南亚美术 》，中国人民大学出版社，2004年。 贺圣达：《东南亚文化发展史》，云南人民出版社，2010年。 （新西兰）尼古拉斯•塔林《剑桥东南亚史》，王士录等译，云南人民出版社，2012年。 梁志明等：《东南亚古代史》，北京大学出版社，2013年\n授课形式是什么样的？\n本课程主要包括由讲课视频、参考教材阅读、作业、在线讨论、期末考试组成。每周的讲课视频有3-5段不等，每一段的时长在10分钟左右。每一周有一次课后作业。 教学团队鼓励修读者互帮互助，主动解答线上提出的问题。\n本课程的评分方法？\n 本课程的成绩评定主要由以下4个部分组成：\n\n单元测验（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一次测验，包括10道客观选择题。同学们需要在课程结束1周内完成测验。\n单元作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个讨论题作为书面作业。同学们需要在课程结束1周内容完成。\n互评作业（占总成绩20%） 每单元都有一个互评作业，每个同学需要评价至少5份作业。同学们需要在课程结束2周内容完成。\n期末考试（占总成绩40%） 由40道客观选择题组成。考试时间2小时。\n\nReading Materials\n\nWu Xuling, Art of Southeast, Remin University Press, 2004.\nHe Shengda, A Cultural History of Southeast Asia, Yunan People’s Publishing House, 2010.\nNicholas Tarling, ed., The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia, Wang Shilu, trans., Yunan People’s Publishing House, 2012.\nLiang Zhiming, A History of Ancient History, Peking University Press, 2013.\n\nCourse format\nThis course consists lecture videos, reading materials, assignments, discussion and final exams.

You may register for this course and peruse the content at your own pace, but at this time you may not pursue a certificate.\nHow can Iran be stopped from getting a nuclear bomb—negotiations, sanctions, or military action? As a participant in this course, you will advise the president in deciding whether, and how, the U.S. should act. Once you’ve made your assessment, you will move on to wrestle with other scenarios preoccupying policy makers. Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? China’s rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take? Leaks are a fact of life — but why do they happen? Who gets them, and why? Should journalists publish or withhold them? Does legal accountability lie with the leaker—or the journalist?\n\r\nThis six-week course casts you as advisors on the hardest decisions any president has to make. We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas. We will also have to contend with the reality that government secrets rarely stay that way. Participants will learn to navigate the political landscape of an era in which private remarks become viral tweets, and mistakes by intelligence agencies become front-page stories.\n\r\nWeekly assignments require strategic thinking: Analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students will learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo,” combining careful analysis and strategic imagination with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support. They will also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.\n \nWays to take this course\nFrom this page, you may register to view the content for the Open version of this course. It has also been offered in the past as an intensive online course (limited enrollment, by application only). Admitted participants took the course on a private platform, read approximately 75 pages per week, completed and received individual feedback on assignments including four short policy memos, participated in sections led by the course Teaching Fellows, and engaged with fellow learners in moderated discussion forums.

No background knowledge is required.\r\n \r\nWe will consider three themes in this course:\n\nFederal Strategies in School Reform: How has the federal government legislated and incented public school reform? What are the implications of those approaches given the nature of local control in American public education? We will discuss three particular strategies the federal government has enacted recently and the diverging perspectives on them.\nSchool Choice: How does school choice aim to improve schools? What forms does it take? Does providing school choice improve schools?\nAccountability: What is the history of accountability in American public schooling? What are the policies and practices associated with accountability and what are the assumptions behind them? Does accountability lead to improved outcomes for students?\n\n",

Editing a photo, re-mixing a song, automatically measuring and adjusting chemical concentrations in a tank: each of these tasks requires real-world data to be captured by a computer and then manipulated digitally to extract the salient information. Ever wonder how signals from the physical world are sampled, stored, and processed without losing the information required to make predictions and extract meaning from the data?\nStudents will find out in this rigorous mathematical introduction to the engineering field of signal processing: the study of signals and systems that extract information from the world around us. This course will teach students to analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both the time and frequency domains. Students will learn convolution, discrete Fourier transforms, the z-transform, and digital filtering. Students will apply these concepts in interactive MATLAB programming exercises (all done in browser, no download required).\nPart 1 of this course analyzes signals and systems in the time domain. Part 2 covers frequency domain analysis.\nPrerequisites include strong problem solving skills, the ability to understand mathematical representations of physical systems, and advanced mathematical background (one-dimensional integration, matrices, vectors, basic linear algebra, imaginary numbers, and sum and series notation). Part 1 is a prerequisite for Part 2. This course is an excerpt from an advanced undergraduate class at Rice University taught to all electrical and computer engineering majors.\n",

No cabe duda de que entender cómo se comportan las estructuras es fundamental para entender el mundo que nos rodea, para comprender la naturaleza y para juzgar mejor los progresos que ha hecho la humanidad a lo largo de la historia. Sin embargo, los ingenieros hemos fallado una y otra vez cuando hemos intentado explicar esta materia de forma que los no entendidos puedan entender su importancia.\nEste curso pretende saltar esa brecha existente entre los expertos en cálculo de estructuras y los profanos utilizando un lenguaje asequible, empleando ejemplos históricos y proponiendo ensayos sencillos que pueden hacerse en casa. El curso abordará no sólo el problema de por qué los edificios y los puentes se caen sino también otras muchas cuestiones ¿Por qué las ventanas de los aviones son redondas? ¿Por qué los gusanos tienen esa forma? ¿Por qué los murciélagos pueden volar dentro de un rosal sin rasgarse las alas? ¿Cómo funcionan las arterias? ¿Por qué las catedrales góticas pueden ser tan esbeltas? ¿Por qué hay construcciones romanas que siguen en pie 2000 años después? ¿Qué podemos aprender sobre los constructores de las diferentes estructuras que nos han legado nuestros antepasados? Muchos contenidos de este curso pueden ser útiles para médicos, biólogos, artistas, historiadores y arqueólogos.\n\nMore info\" / \"Más información\n",

    "description": "WHAT IS “HOW STUFF MOVES”?\r\nMechanics is the study of how things move. It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.\nThis is the first in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 1 explores the concepts of momentum, force, and energy, and how these properties define the motion of objects at everyday speeds. Part 2 examines angular motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion.  This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is exciting; using those rules to predict correctly something that you haven’t observed means that you really understand something. It‘s a great feeling.\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?\r\nYou need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.\nThere is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of this course to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.\n",

Though libraries have been loved for over 3,600 years, their relevance in the digital age is being questioned, and their economic and social impacts are poorly understood. What is really essential about libraries and librarians, today and tomorrow? How can library members and all who support the mission of 21st-century librarianship raise the profile and support of these timeless values and services, and ensure universal access to the universe of ideas in all our communities? This course is based on what works. We’ll take an inspired, strategic, evidence-based approach to advocacy for the future of strong communities – cities, villages, universities and colleges, research and development centres, businesses, and not-for-profits.\n\r\nWe will cover:\n\nValues and transformative impacts of libraries and librarianship\nResearch on current perceptions of libraries and librarians\nRole of relationships in advocacy\nPrinciples of influence and their impact on advocacy\nStrategic thinking and planning in advocacy\nEffective communication: messages, messengers, and timing\n\nGuest speakers share their ideas, recommendations and successes. These leading advocates include, among others: \n\nBarbara Band, Emmbrook School, Berkshire\nCathy De Rosa, OCLC\nKen Haycock, University of Southern California\nJoe Janes, University of Washington\nNancy Kranich, Rutgers University\nVictoria Owen, University of Toronto\nJohn Szabo, Los Angeles Public Library\n\nPrevious participants have said that this course – “showed me the value of building relationships,” and “made me approach our library’s advocacy much differently”, and “helped me see advocacy in a new light.\"\n\r\nAdvocacy is growing in urgency and importance on the agenda of all library associations.  In this highly competitive environment, associations help their members and their communities to build advocacy capacity.  This course meets that strategic need. It is offered in partnership with the Canadian Library Association and the American Library Association.\n\n \n\"\nFor the full description, please see the syllabus at:\nhttp://courses.edx.org/c4x/University_of_TorontoX/LA101x_2/asset/LA101X__2015__Syllabus.docx\n",

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course explores the complex interactions between poverty, rural livelihoods, and forest resources in developing countries.  We will consider some of the dynamics that occur when impoverished people use forests in their daily lives. We will talk about the role of forests for medicines and wild foods, as sources of fuelwood and charcoal for energy, and other pressing topics that confront sustainable forest management such as the impacts of human health and diseases on forests. The course consists of modules on forests and livelihoods in developing countries, agroforestry, human health in forested environments, protected areas and their sustainability, small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs), and  community forestry. Three cross-cutting themes (gender, tenure and forest rights, and climate change) will span all of the modules.\n\r\nThis course will engage you in developing a deeper understanding of the fundamental importance of forest resources in the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries. Participants from tropical and developing countries may have lived much of what we will talk about in this course, and your experiences will deepen our understanding of the course material. Participants not from a developing country will gain a much better appreciation for the multitude of ways that people in developing countries use forest resources. Weekly videos will be complemented by readings, quizzes, and links to online resources to help you explore current scholarship in this domain. A discussion forum will enable you to delve more deeply into these issues with other participants and the course staff. The themes covered in this MOOC are important to anyone working in international forestry.\n",

    "description": "Vision may feel effortless: you open your eyes, and the world appears. But the process of focusing light into image on the back of the eye and translating it into meaningful nerve signals is incredibly complex. The retina and visual cortex are packed with intricate processing circuitry, and have been a mystery to neuroscientists for centuries. Now, answers are beginning to emerge.\r\n \r\nToday, the visual system is often called the model system for neuroscience: its findings are relevant to all other areas and to investigating the deeper mysteries of the brain’s microstructure and function. In this course, we take you from the physics of focusing light onto the retina, to the processing of colors, form, and motion, and finally to the interpretation of visual information in the cortex. We distill the mysteries of the visual system by posing questions and investigating them in a series of thematic, animated videos. This journey through the eye, retina and brain will (quite literally) change how you see the world.\n",

    "description": "Capturing and analyzing data has changed how decisions are made and resources are allocated in businesses, journalism, government, and military and intelligence fields. Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.\nIn education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That’s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning.\nData, Analytics, and Learning provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data.  Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course.\nHow this course works:\nThis course will experiment with multiple learning pathways. It has been structured to allow learners to take various pathways through learning content - either in the existing edX format or in a social competency-based and self-directed format. Learners will have access to pathways that support both beginners, and more advanced students, with pointers to additional advanced resources. In addition to interactions within the edX platform, learners will be encouraged to engage in distributed conversations on social media such as blogs and Twitter.\n",

    "description": "Shakespeare wrote for a popular audience and was immensely successful. Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare’s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear, and The Winter's Tale.\nImage courtesy Castle Rock Entertainment/The Kobal Collection\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

    "description": "8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit.\nEffective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).\nCourse Flow\nSince this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic.\nThere will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics.\nSince this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%).  For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.  For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas & New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat do I have to buy in order to participate in the course?\n\nNothing. All edX courses are free. \nThe lectures, homework, and lecture notes are all available online.\n\n\nWill certificates be awarded?\n\nYes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in 8.EFTx will earn for free a certificate of mastery. \nThese certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. \nCertificates will be issued by edX under the name of MITx.\n\n\nWhat textbook do I need for the course?\n\nIn 8.EFTx readings will be mainly from a latex version of the lecture notes and freely available online arXiv research articles.\nOccasionally additional reading from commonly available quantum field theory textbooks will be suggested to supplement these free sources.\n\n\nWhen can I watch the lectures?\n\nYou can watch the lectures any time at your leisure.\n\n\nCan I register to the class after the start date has passed?\n\nYes, you can register at any time between the start date and the end date. \nTo obtain the certificate, however, you will have to get at least 60% of the total available points for the class.\n\n\nI don't have the prerequisites. Can I still take the course?\n\nWe do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try. \nHowever, 8.EFTx does depend on experience with quantum field theory.\n\n\nWho can register for this course?\n\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. \nWhile edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran, Sudan and Cuba, our license does not cover this course. \nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. \nWe are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n",

The objective of this course is to: develop and improve non-science students' scientific literacy so that students have some basic knowledge of chemistry, chemists thinking, problem solving understanding, expand their horizons and knowledge, understanding today Several major challenges facing human society association between the chemical and, thereby contribute to students' own career development.\nThe main content of the chemical and the basic concepts of society, including chemical, organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, materials chemistry, environmental chemistry, geochemistry, energy, chemistry, biochemistry, food chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and household chemistry. At the beginning of the course, will briefly introduce some basic concepts and knowledge of chemistry, followed by some important branches of chemistry, and they are widely used in social life.\nChemical originated in ancient mysticism. East and West Taoist alchemists in pursuit of immortality and endless wealth in the process laid the foundation for chemistry experiments, to develop a more systematic method and apparatus for chemical experiments. Although saver warlocks do not realize their initial goal, but they made one more great achievement, it is a chemical used as a science was born.\nChemistry with theoretical and experimental basis for the broad application areas, after three hundred years of development, has become a pillar disciplines of human civilization. Recalling the history of human development, almost iconic during the progress of each civilization are closely related to the contribution of chemists. Metal fabrication technology, artificial ammonia technology, synthetic rubber and plastics and nano materials are first hand from the chemist, and therefore no exaggeration to say that the chemical is a cornerstone of human civilization.\nThe purpose of this course is not the culture and society of chemical chemist, but describes the chemical and its achievements, describing the discipline's past, present and future. Therefore, this course is like a \"tourist spaceship\", with students overlook this magical area, along a taste of the chemical in the most representative area. Through the study of chemistry and society, students can not only learn some basic knowledge of chemistry, the relationship can be the history and status quo of chemistry, chemical and society, current and future prospects of some hot issues in the field of chemistry and the chemical has a contour Formula understanding.\n\nThis is a past/archived course.

    "description": "This course, the first installment of the multi-part Poetry in America series, covers American poetry in cultural context through the year 1700. The course begins with Puritan poets--some orthodox, some rebel spirits--who wrote and lived in early New England. Focusing on Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, and Michael Wigglesworth, among others, we explore the interplay between mortal and immortal, Europe and wilderness, solitude and sociality in English North America.\nLed by Harvard Professor Elisa New, Poetry in America surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

    "description": "The last century ushered in significant progress. Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them. Join this thought-provoking, broad-sweeping course as it draws intriguing connections between philosophy, art, literature, and history, illuminating our world and our place in it.

Topics covered include the concept of a robot’s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. NOTE: Part II will cover screw motions and the product of exponentials kinematics formula, inverse kinematics of open chains, velocity kinematics and statics, closed chain kinematics, and basics of robot control.\n",

    "description": "Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?\nStat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.\nThe methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, \"The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points,\" or, \"Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...,\" then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.\n",

    "description": "Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.\nNewtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution.\nNOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy”\nWe have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems.  This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism.\nIf you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course.  To join these discussions,  verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum.\nNote that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher.\nTeachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.\nCourse Syllabus\nNote: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials\nThe RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online.  We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course  - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning.   (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC).  This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that  will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students.  At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups.  We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities.\nOur experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects.  As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:\n\nWe will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). \nThe grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials.\n\nNote: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above. \nWelcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course.\n\nFAQs\nIs there a required textbook?\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).\n \nWhat if I take a vacation?\nThe course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.\n \nWill I get a certficiate?\nYes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.\n \nHow are grades assigned?\nThere are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.\nThe course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.\nThere is no final exam.\n",

We will also examine various cosmic phenomena, from variable or exploding stars to the expansion of the universe and the evidence for dark matter, dark energy, and the big bang. The universe as a whole and all of its major constituents are evolving, and we now have a fairly complete and consistent picture of these processes that is based on the objective evidence from observations and the laws of physics.

    "description": "Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1000 students each year. Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.\nThe focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen \"just by chance\"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.\nWe will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.\nBe warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you're really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you'll find other ways of earning money.)\nThe fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the format of the class?\n\nInstruction will be consist of brief lectures and exercises to check comprehension. Grades (Pass or Not Pass) will be decided based on a combination of scores on short assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.\n\n\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\n\nNothing! The course is free.\n\n\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\n\nYes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.\n\n\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\n\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.\n\n\nWill certificates be awarded?\n\nYes. Online learners who achieve a passing grade in a course can earn a certificate of achievement. These certificates will indicate you have successfully completed the course, but will not include a specific grade. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of BerkeleyX, designating the institution from which the course originated.\n\n\nCan I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?\n\nYes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.\n\n\nDo I need any other materials to take the course?\n\nIf you have any questions about edX generally, please see the edX FAQ.\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Too much mathematical rigor teaches rigor mortis: the fear of making an unjustified leap even when it lands on a correct result. Instead of paralysis, have courage: Shoot first and ask questions later. Although unwise as public policy, it is a valuable problem-solving philosophy and the theme of this course: how to guess answers without a proof or an exact calculation, in order to develop insight.\nYou will learn this skill by mastering six reasoning tools---dimensional analysis, easy cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, taking out the big part, and analogy. The applications will include mental calculation, estimating population growth rates, understanding drag without differential equations, singing musical intervals to estimate logarithms, approximating integrals, summing infinite series, and turning differential equations into algebra.\nYour learning will be supported by regular readings that you discuss with other students, by short tablet videos, by quick problems to help you check your understanding, by weekly homework problems, review and and a final exam. You will work hard, and, by the end of the course, have learned a rough-and-ready approach to using mathematics to understand the world.\nAll required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press. A print version of the course textbook, Street-Fighting Math, is also available for purchase. The MIT Press is offering enrolled students a special 30% discount on books ordered directly through the publisher’s website. To take advantage of this offer, please use promotion code SFM30 at The MIT Press. \n\nFAQ\n\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\n\nBack in 2010, MIT Press agreed to publish the textbook, *Street-Fighting Mathematics*, under a free license (in print and online). \nThus, the book is legally available all over the internet, including on this course platform. \nAs a registered student in this course, you can also purchase a printed book from MIT Press at a discount.\n\n\nDo you often get into street fights?\n\nThe last time was in high school, when I was attacked for being “different” and suspended for fighting back. \nHowever, in my problem-solving fights (and now that I’m older!), I regularly use reasoning tools and we’ll do the same in this course.\n\n\n\n",

The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics—in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher.

How does it affect our democratic institutions? Do you know that the metadata collected by a cellular network speaks volumes about its users? In this course you will explore all of these questions while investigating related issues in WiFi and Internet surveillance. The issues explored in this course are at the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology and will appeal to anyone interested in the technical, political, and moral questions inherent in the use of information networks. The course will include broad overviews for the novice, while pointing to the detailed resources needed for those engaged in the development of corporate or governmental policies.\nFAQ\n\n\nIs there a required textbook?\n\n\n​No. A list of supplemental resources, including textbooks, will be provided. The textbook, Cellular Convergence and the Death of Privacy, is optional.\n\n\n\n\nHow much time will I spend on the course during the week?\n\n\nExpect to spend 4-8 hours per week. This depends on a number of factors, including how much you want to engage with the material and the level of understanding you desire.\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to have taken an electrical and computer engineering course before? \n\n\nNo. Though there will be discussion of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) ideas, the professor will assume no prior ECE training.\n\n\n\n\nI am not familiar with U.S. or European history but I am interested in how the law regarding cell phones works. Can I take this course?\n\n\nYes. I will have relevant links to helpful background material for each section that should make it possible for those with no knowledge of U.S. or European history to take the class.\n\n\n\n\nIs this class about building a network?\n\n\nThis class is primarily about how historical privacy law has made it possible for current information technologies to be used to collect data and conduct surveillance rather than how to build a network. While the course will touch on important engineering developments and information technology uses, this class will focus more on the intersection of networking technology, law, and sociology. If you want to know how cell phones collect data and why this data can be used in court, this is the class for you.\n\n\n\n\nWill certificates be awarded?\n\n\nYes.

    "description": "We live on the surface of a dynamic and yet paradoxically stable planet that experiences a remarkable range of energetic phenomena, from waves and currents in the ocean to wind and thunderstorms in the atmosphere. This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.\nHow much time will the course take?\nObviously the answer will depend on your background and motivation to master the course material. Each week will consist of 5 or 6 segments that will each take 5 to 10 minutes to watch or listen to once. There will be some exploratory questions for each lesson and a confirmation quiz for each week. There will be one exploratory activity for each week. The average commitment will be 2-3 hours per week with perhaps 20 hours required for the whole course.\nWhat background does the course assume?\nWe’ll ask you to pull out a calculator from time to time (but not all the time!) simply as this will help you really master the key ideas. The key thing is to have a curiosity and interest in what makes our planet tick!\nWhat kind of learning activities will the course involve?\nThe activities are designed to use basic household objects, and our own senses, to engage with observations of the world, and to think about what these mean and lead to. We’ll get you to sense how cold or warm different objects get when left in the sun, and to observe how energy explains things we see and hear.\nWhat difference will the course make to my life?\nThe course has the conviction that it is hard to care for or value things that we don’t appreciate or have never considered. Although harsh in certain places and times, the Earth’s surface is remarkably habitable. Many forms of life can make their way in many kinds of terrain and climate. What produces these conditions? How are they maintained? We will seek to answer those questions in rudimentary form at least.\nWhat conversations will the course help to perform? \nCourses often imagine a context in which the course material is discussed, and this one is no different. It imagines a setting with family or friends where you might have just learned of a news event involving a storm like a hurricane or thunderstorm, or where a community might have experienced a flood or a drought, or merely unusual weather. You might have heard of El Nino or climate change in the news. This course will give you a background to better engage in a conversation about these great matters, and offer a better sense of the complexity, challenge and wonder connected to living on the surface of such an energetic planet.\n",

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.\nThe course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。\nHow can I get access to reading materials?\nPlease download the materials from designated websites. Western Music in the 20th Century is the main textbook.\r\n \n如何获得课后阅读材料？\r\n在指定网站下载课后阅读材料，以《20世纪西方音乐》为主要教材。\nHow can I have access to the listening resources?\nPlease visit the designated websites to complete the listening exercises.\n如何获得课后聆赏素材资源？\r\n在指定网址链接点击课后指定聆赏的音视频资源。\nHow can I finish assignments?\nWritten and listening exercises will be a part of this course. Please submit them to the specified mailbox after completion.\r\n \n如何完成课后作业？\r\n课后作业依照情况而定，分为文字作业和聆听作业，完成后直接提交到指定邮箱。\nWhat will the exams be like for this course?\nThe exams will be open-book written assignments.\n\n如何考试？\r\n考试将采取开卷考试方式，根据不同学生群体情况，或以论文形式，或以在线考试，或以作业完成情况最终确定成绩。\nHow will scores be calculated?\nThe grading weights will vary per topics and tasks. Generally, all students can pass the course by completing all specified assignments. The passing score will be primarily decided by the final exam. \n\n考试成绩的计算？\r\n不同学期课题，不同学习任务，教师将及时调整考试成绩的计算方式。一般情况，在完成课程所指定任务的前提下，学生可以百分之百通过考试。分数确定主要以期末考试为主，期中考试是否举行，以情况而定。\nCan I submit graded assignments late? \nNo.\n如果考试方式是论文，是否允许延迟上交？\r\n绝对不允许。\nHow can I best engage with online learning for this course?\nApart from the questions gained from the micro lectures, students can also get their questions answered via e-mail, and have access to the discussion forum and online interest groups.\n\n在线学习如何进行？\r\n课程所提供的课前短课视 频系必读内容，在课后阅读、课后作业和课后聆赏完成过程中，产生的所有问题将被汇总，由教师或以文字邮件的方式或以视频短课录制的方式做出回答。此刻，教 师将根据学生的问题及时安排在线答疑、在线讨论，并发挥网络教学的便利，建立课程讨论区，组织兴趣小组\nWhat is the role of the on-campus class for this course?\nThe on-campus course will serve students who can attend the class for lectures, which are then recorded and released online.\n\n教师课堂面授的作用？\r\n为服务可以出席面授的学生，本课程将在在线学习之外，安排固定时间固定长度的教师课程面授，教学活动将被录制，在线发布，以保证在线学习学生的需求。\nWill I fail to keep up in the course due to my lack of understanding about the field of music?\nOur content is adjusted to a general audience. \n\n课程是否会因在音乐领域积累不足而无法跟进？\r\n教师依照课程核心，一方面给出清晰课程线索，跟进不难，另一方面，教师尽可能调整课程内容，照顾到全体情况。根据以往的经验，课程结束，同学均可跟进课程标准，且不乏各样收获。\nAre there content knowledge pre-requisites for this course?\nAn earnest desire to learn and a proactive, professional attitude are more important than prior knowledge of content matter. The learners are expected to absorb the basic content points quickly and use them as a base for further learning.\n\n课程内容秉持怎样的上课标准？\n教师保持一贯上课理念，认为专业，关于态度，不关乎知识，不会因同学不同程度，顾左右言其他，忽略最核心最关键知识点及问题的涉及。\nWhich is more important for this course, knowledge or ability?\nThis course is most concerned on the development of music listening ability, though some knowledge of music will be helpful. \n课程重视知识还是能力？\r\n课 程最关心音乐聆听能力的发展，在提供行之有效聆听技术的同时，安排适当知识内容的传授。加之考试不重知识，而重能力，因此，课程中因教室光线不足而造成无 法做太多笔记，恰恰是教师所希望的。课后传发同学的曲目说明，其中所标出的知识点，所指系能力而非知识。在音乐领域，所谓历史是听觉样本，即艺术品本身积 累起来的，而非人名和作品名串联起来的。艺术史，是感觉的历史，不是文字描述的历史。\nWhat is the aim of the music puzzle assignment within the course?\nThe purpose of the assignment is to prepare and develop audiometry and memory skills.\n\n课程所谓音乐拼图作业的目的是什么？\r\n作 业的目的，在于听觉甄别力和记忆力的筹备与发展。相当于我们小时候玩得拼图或积木游戏，从局部观察到整体把握，这一训练所形成的对线条、形状、色泽等构成 物的甄别与记忆，不仅是视觉所需，也是发达听觉所必备。多数情况下，类似课程作业的练习，在中国音乐课程中，很少会有。之所以课程一开始便这样做，是因为 知道学生听觉的普遍问题。不少同学在实践之初，会遇到困难，这很正常，如果没有做好接受困难的准备，也就不必来此课程分享，也就不必来北大读书了。\nWill the course provide information about music composition and technology?\nNo. Music composition mastery requires long-term training, usually at a conservatory level.\n\n课程是否可能或可以提供关于作曲的知识与技术？\r\n课 程不可能在作曲方面给予单独帮助，通过目前的教学方式，尽管正在探索，教师只能也必须照顾到最大多数同学的需求，这一难处，是客观的，请多谅解。关于作曲 四大件的技术发展，在音乐学院有一套完整的训练程序，乐理是入门，和声是基础，二者建立关于调性音乐系统的初阶。随后的复调写作，作曲系耗时约需一年甚至 更多，根据全面仿作练习，帮助同学发展多声思维和多声部操控技术。配器是第三梯度，约需一年时间完成，全面掌握乐队法。曲式分析，是封顶收官之课。将之前 所有梯队课程的内容，一并总结。\nWill the course be available in English?\nThe videos in the course will include English subtitles. However, the rest of the course content will only be available in Mandarin.\n这门课程使用英语授课吗？\r\n视频中教师使用中文授课，有英文字幕，但是课程的其他内容，如阅读、作业题、讨论等都只用中文。\n",

    "description": "Quantum computation is a remarkable subject building on the great computational discovery that computers based on quantum mechanics are exponentially powerful. This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.

    "description": "Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.\r\n \nFAQ\nHow much does it cost to take the course?\r\nNothing! The course is free.\nWhen will assignments be due?\r\nThe course is organized into weeks, and each week will have its own set of assignments. Students will be expected to complete their homework each week.\nDo I need any other materials to take the course?\r\nNope, as long as you’ve got a Mac or PC, you’ll be ready to take the course.\nWill the course use any textbooks or software?\r\nYes! We'll have free access to the book \"Principles of Biostatistics\" written by Marcello Pagano (one of the Professors) and Kimberlee Gauvreau.\nIn addition to the textbook, we'll use Stata (a piece of software for doing statistical analysis).\nThanks to our friends at Statacorp, we'll have free copies of Stata available for all students to use for the duration of the course (Mac and PC only).\nDo I need to watch the lectures live?\r\nNo. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.\nWill certificates be awarded?\r\nYes.
