Why <i>collaborative</i> knowledge services? Knowledge services cannot be technology, data or content alone. It’s about humans coming together. No one person, no one organization, no one institution, no one nation can know it all. In the end, it's all about how we come together.

The skills that we refine over time as technical communicators have a critical place in project management: communicating content, identifying audience needs, extracting knowledge from subject matter experts, and ensuring quality deliverables.  Many technical communicators can step into a project manager role using these highly transferable, existing skills. What are the transferable skills? How can you work toward a broader role in your organization? What is project management? Why is project management important to the technical communicator? Using an interdisciplinary approach applicable across multiple programs of study, this course enhances your understanding of project management and prepares you to step up successfully for project management assignments and roles in your career using basic technical writing skills. </p>",

Recently, Feeding America, the national network organization of food banks, issued a nutrition framework to provide food banks with nutrition criteria for identifying healthful foods and beverages. Food banks are seeking direction in applying nutrition guidelines and generally how to move toward nutrition-focused food banking.
