Java developers are highly sought after professionals, and increasingly so, Java is a staple of every technologist’s resume!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Java learning series is comprised of three parts, of which Part 1 introduces programming on the basis of familiar concepts, like calculators and games. Powerful concepts such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are progressively introduced throughout the five weeks. Examples and case studies are provided so that learners can implement simple programs on their own or by collaborating with peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2 will focus on how to write “good” programs and Part 3 will deal with fundamental data structures. Part 2 and Part 3 will be scheduled soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming knowledge is not only needed to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones, but it also opens doors to computational thinking, i.e., the application of computing techniques to every-day processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With new content and enhanced problems, this is an improved version of the course released in April 2015.

An <strong>operating system</strong> (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS.

Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence&nbsp;: au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nCe cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui «&nbsp;examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives&nbsp;», nous explorerons la façon dont «&nbsp;des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité&nbsp;» (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em>Ce cours sera enseigné en français.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<hr />Often confined to the study of techniques like selling a 24-volume encyclopedia to a recalcitrant octogenarian or to the art of haggling salary, negotiation is frequently approached from a purely utilitarian perspective. But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who “look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,” we will explore how “imperfect beings behave in reality (Raïffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>This course is taught in French.</em></div>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-07-05T15:49:44-04:00", "title": "Psychologie de la négociation", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Université catholique de Louvain"], "commitment": null, "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/psychologie-de-la-negociation_378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/psychologie-de-la-negociation-louvainx-louv7x-0", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Business & Management", "Communication", "Social Sciences"], "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["Others"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-10-04T00:00:00-04:00"},

En la inmensa mayoría de los países no se pueden comprar y vender órganos. ¿Por qué? A pesar de que muchas personas siguen muriendo a la espera de recibir un órgano, en ningún país se confiscan los órganos de las personas fallecidas. ¿Por qué? ¿Pueden donar los menores? ¿Debemos prescindir de la conocida como “regla del donante cadáver” y permitir la eutanasia para la donación? ¿Con qué límites? ¿De qué manera influye la potencial condición de donante de un órgano en los cuidados que se proporcionan al final de la vida? ¿Cómo evitar el conflicto de intereses entre quienes velan por la vida de los futuros receptores de un órgano y quienes aún se afanan por cuidar a quien va a fallecer de manera irremisible e inminente?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEn este curso nos adentraremos en el análisis de ésas y otras cuestiones, pero también introduciremos los nuevos desafíos que para la ética y el Derecho plantean trasplantes novedosos así como la discusión en torno a los criterios de justa distribución de los órganos<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>The first successful organ transplantation was performed in 1954. </em><em>Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs’ transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called “dead donor rule” and allow “organ-donation euthanasia”? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n", "end_date": "2017-10-04T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Trasplante de órganos - desafíos éticos y jurídicos | Organ Transplantation - Ethical and Legal Challenges", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Universidad Autónoma de Madrid"], "commitment": "4-6 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/trasplante_de_organos_378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/trasplante-de-organos-desafios-eticos-y-uamx-txetj201x-1", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Law", "Medicine", "Philosophy & Ethics"], "duration": "9 weeks", "language_name": ["English", "Others"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-10-04T00:00:00-04:00"},

Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field.

We recommend you browse the course to learn about GFA, its mission, how it works, the courses that will be available over the coming months, and the outcomes we hope to provide to our learners. Click \"See more\" to view frequently asked questions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Financial Aid Available?</strong><br />\r\nWe are pursuing options to make financial aid available, but at this time it is not available to GFA students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I receive university credit for courses via GFA even if I have not received my high school diploma or passed the high school equivalency exam?</strong><br />\r\nAnyone can take these courses for ASU credit. However, if you’d like to apply them toward a university degree, you will most likely need your high school diploma or proof that you’ve passed the high school equivalency exam. This will also depend on the policies of the particular university to which you are applying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is GFA for Freshman only?</strong><br />\r\nNo. While GFA is perfect for incoming Freshman who want to enjoy a flexible, economically-viable model for taking Freshman-level courses, ambitious high school students who want a jump-start for their college career, or adult-learners returning to Freshman year after a hiatus, these introductory-level courses can be taken by anyone who wants to continue lifelong learning or by educators who want to share resources with students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will GFA be extended to full college degrees?</strong><br />\r\nAt this time, edX and ASU are focused on breaking down the barriers to successfully completing Freshman year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I get a letter grade on my Verified Certificate?&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nNo. Your Verified Certificate is provided by edX to any student who completes an ID Verified course with a passing score (which varies, but will be clearly communicated via course materials) and will not feature a letter grade. Additionally, your Verified Certificate does not equal credit earned by ASU and you will still need to complete the steps required for credit conversion after you have earned the Verified Certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I get a letter grade on my Arizona State University transcript?</strong><br />\r\nYes students who pursue the ID Verified track will receive a letter grade from ASU for the course and an official Arizona State University transcript if they pay the credit fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is the estimated effort (18 hours per week) for these courses so high?&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nAs a tier-1 public research university, ASU courses reflect the rigorous standards faculty members expect of their students. Given this, ASU recommends that for a 7.5 week course, students should be prepared to spend 6 hours a week on coursework for every 1 course credit. So for a 3 credit course, you should expect to spend approximately 18 hours of coursework per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To what extent can I use credits earned via GFA to apply for a university degree?</strong><br />\r\nArizona State University is an accredited university. Credits you earn via Global Freshman Academy will appear on an Arizona State University transcript and can be used as transfer credits anywhere ASU credits are accepted. We recommend that you check with your university to see whether ASU credits are accepted. While having earned ASU credits before you apply to a university will not guarantee your admittance, we believe many universities will value the hard work you have already completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will Arizona State University credits be accepted at international universities?</strong><br />\r\nUniversity credits are typically recognized globally when they come from accredited institutions. Please check with your local university to see Arizona State University credits are accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After having taken a class and passed, what is the maximum allotted time to pay for the credit through ASU?</strong><br />\r\nYou will be able to upgrade from a standard Verified Certificate to credit for one year after you successfully complete and pass the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will exam proctoring work?</strong><br />\r\nStudents who have chosen the Verified track in the course will be asked to re-verify their ID upon launching any proctored exam in a GFA course. During a proctored exam, students will be monitored for the duration of the exam, and suspect behavior will be flagged and reviewed within 3-5 days of exam submission. A webcam will be required for proctored exams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will GFA courses be offering any accommodations for people with learning disabilities? Especially during proctored exams?</strong><br />\r\nedX is committed to achieving full accessibility (WCAG 2.0 compliant or better) in the platform. We are continuously making accessibility improvements as we build out new capabilities and programs in order to meet this stringent standard. In terms of our proctoring solution, we are working with the software vendor and our university partners to ensure anyone taking courses for credit eligibility has an equitable experience. Accessibility is a key requirement for Arizona State University, as well. All Global Freshman Academy courses delivered through the edX platform will be ADA compliant and transcripts for hearing impaired students will be available for each video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the full list of courses offered via Global Freshman Academy?</strong><br />\r\nTo see the most up-to-date list of courses offered by Global Freshman Academy, visit the&nbsp;<span class=\"error\"><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/gfa\">Future GFA Courses</a> </span>section of the&nbsp;Welcome to Global Freshman Academy Course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If I fail a class in GFA, will it be reflected on my transcript?&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nIf you do not pass the course, you will not be eligible for the upgrade to credit. The failure will not appear anywhere on your ASU transcript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If I fail a GFA course, will I have the option to retake it at no additional cost?&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nWith the Global Freshman Academy, you only pay for the course credit once you receive a passing grade. If you need to retake a course, you can do so at anytime but will be required to again pay the $45 ID Verification fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If I already know the material of a course offered via GFA, would I have the option to test-out and receive ASU credit?</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nAt this time, we do not offer an option to test out of the material offered in a GFA course. You will need to complete and pass all course material in order to be eligible for credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will you have courses in other subject areas? e.g., Education, Management, Psychics, Computer Science, etc.</strong><br />\r\nThe Global Freshman Academy is a collection of freshman level courses that fulfill a specific set of general education requirements.

Can I still take courses through GFA?</strong><br />\r\nWe would first recommend checking with the university of your choice, whether that is ASU or elsewhere, to see which of the credits you already have would transfer in and what freshman year classes you may still need to take. This will give you a better idea of what GFA courses you would find beneficial.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-07-05T21:05:49-04:00", "title": "Welcome to Global Freshman Academy", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Arizona State University"], "commitment": "Browse at your own pace.", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/gfa_banner3.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/welcome-global-freshman-academy-asux-gfademox", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Education & Teacher Training"], "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2015-04-23T00:00:00-04:00"},

Maharbiz, Tom Zajdel", "description": "<p>EE40LX teaches the fundamentals of engineering electronic interfaces between the physical world and digital devices. Students can expect to cover the material of a traditional first circuits course with a project-based approach. We start with essential theory and develop an understanding of the building blocks of electronics as we analyze, design, and build different parts of a robot from scratch around a microcontroller. This course uses the Texas Instruments MSP430G2 LaunchPad, but you are welcome to bring whichever development board or microcontroller you like!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Useful mathematics will be discussed where appropriate, but only a working knowledge of high school algebra is required to follow along for most of the course.&nbsp;The philosophy of the course is to learn by doing, so every lecture features a substantial lab component. Students are invited to work together in small groups to build their own robots along with the instructors. There will also be individual circuit analysis and design exercises to reinforce the theories presented in the course. Those who successfully complete each theory assignment and earn a passing grade will get an Honor Code certificate from BerkeleyX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Additionally, a kit of electronic components will be available from Newark element14 starting June 12</span>. The kit is not necessary to obtain a certificate for this run of the course, but it will greatly enhance your learning experience. Some mechanical components are required to complete the robot as presented in the course. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creativity is encouraged! Students who are willing to work outside the bounds of the class to develop their own inventions will get the most out of this guided learning experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MyDAQ Information</strong><br />\r\nThose who do not have access to an oscilloscope or a digital multimeter might consider purchasing a MyDAQ to enable measurements. The video modules use the MyDAQ and the MyProtoBoard as measurement equipment to debug circuits. National Instruments has made available the MyDAQ for students in this course. If you are interested, take a look at the MyDAQ ordering page: <a href=\"http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.studica.com/us/en/BerkeleyMOOC.html</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Parts Kit Information</strong><br />\r\nThe parts included in the construction of the robot can be purchased at Newark's landing page, which can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.element14.com/community/community/learning-center/online-learning/moocs/edxucb-bridging</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA detailed bill of materials with more information can be found here: <a href=\"http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">courses.edx.org/asset-v1:BerkeleyX+EE40LX+2T2015+type@asset+block@EE40LX_PartsList_Summer15.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the format of the class?</strong><br />\r\nThe class consists of eight modules. Every module consists of a combination of theory-based lectures and lab-based discussions where we apply that module’s theory to building a part of a robot. Quiz exercises are sprinkled throughout the videos to reinforce your knowledge and every module ends with a problem set that reinforces the design and analysis aspects of the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is this class taught at UC Berkeley?</strong><br />\r\nThis class is part of the laboratory component of \"EE40: Introduction to Microelectronic Systems,\" the first circuit analysis course at UC Berkeley. It was specifically designed for the online course format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What will the robot do?</strong><br />\r\nThe bare-bones robot that we build will be capable of bouncing around, responding to light or touch inputs, and responding to a loud audio signal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What supplies and equipment will I need to get the most out of this course?</strong><br />\r\nIn order to download programs to the MSP430 microcontroller, you will need access to a modern operating system (Apple, Windows, or Linux) with the Energia environment (http://energia.nu/download) installed. Additionally, access to some wire cutters and pliers would be useful. Also, the lab experience will be most effective if you have access to a digital multimeter. An oscilloscope would be useful, but not necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NI MyDAQ has been made available for students who would like to follow along with the course. The robot project as presented also requires a few wooden craft sticks and two springs which can be found at a local hardware store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much does the kit cost?</strong><br />\r\nThe parts kit will cost around $50 USD for most parts. You are welcome to purchase a kit with another student and to work together on labs to split costs. We will also demonstrate other parts not in the kit for those interested in extending their projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I need to know how to program?</strong><br />\r\nSample programs are provided in each module that will allow you to test your own circuits with an MSP430 LaunchPad controller. These programs will be explained in optional videos for interested students. If you already know how to code, you can tweak these programs to add additional functionality to your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will this course cover microcontroller programming?</strong><br />\r\nNo. Sample programs written in Energia, a high-level language, will be provided, but programming will not be explicitly covered. Students interested in learning microcontroller programming should refer to&nbsp;UT Austinx’s Embedded Systems&nbsp;course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if I already have a microcontroller?</strong><br />\r\nSince analog electronics are the emphasis of the course, you should feel free to use any microcontroller you feel comfortable with. However, the use of any other microcontrollers would require you to write your own programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there a required textbook?</strong><br />\r\nNo textbook is required for this course. Handouts are provided for the concepts presented in the class; material for some of these handouts is taken from the 2nd&nbsp;edition of the book&nbsp;<em>Circuits</em>&nbsp;by Fawwaz Ulaby and Michel Maharbiz and we recommend the book as way to delve deeper into basic circuit concepts. We also occasionally provide links to web content that we find useful or informative.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2015-09-01T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Electronic Interfaces: Bridging the Physical and Digital Worlds", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Berkeley"], "commitment": "6-10 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/berkeleyxee40lx-378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/electronic-interfaces-bridging-physical-uc-berkeleyx-ee40lx-0", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Electronics", "Engineering"], "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2015-07-13T00:00:00-04:00"},

This module also explores printing in East Asia, by wood block and movable type, and the late dominance of manuscript production in the Islamic world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first units of this module we compare and contrast manuscripts and printed books produced mainly in Europe from 1470-1700, looking at continuities and differences in layout, format, and the methods, materials, and economics of production. We also discuss examples of illustrated books and of handwritten annotations in books, including marginal annotations by readers and the marks of censors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two shorter units in this module focus on printing in East Asia, especially China, to highlight the features of woodblock printing which was common there, and on the Middle East, especially the Ottoman context, where a vibrant manuscript culture remained dominant until 1800. Taken together, this module gives an overview of three different contexts and technologies of book production before 1800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each unit features rare manuscripts and printed books in the Harvard Libraries, which viewers can investigate in more depth within the courseware and on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the&nbsp;edX honor code.

The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>account for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Scrolls of indeterminate length</li>\r\n\t<li>Scrolls in long format</li>\r\n\t<li>Ceremonial and archaizing scrolls</li>\r\n\t<li>Portable scrolls</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Scrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University’s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard’s special collections library, in Spring 2014.

The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course will cover the following topics in four modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?</li>\r\n\t<li>Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.</li>\r\n\t<li>Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive \"Hibiya Riot\" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of \"imperial democracy\" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.</li>\r\n\t<li>Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s.

Achieving this requires a deep understanding of current social problems and how policy is formulated, alongside the ability to tell that story in a manner that drives an otherwise apathetic public into action.\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of this online course is two-fold: 1) to teach people from all walks of life how to use journalism and media as an implement of social change; and 2) have those students become effective change agents themselves. This class is not theoretical – students should be prepared to dig in deep and make meaningful contributions to policy change on a global level.\r\n\r\n<p>This course equips students with the knowledge and skills they need to produce solution-based journalism – stories that give equal weight to problems and solutions. Throughout the course, students will view examples of outstanding solution-based journalism. The majority of these stories focus on vulnerable children. The umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts.\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, this course provides students with a platform to research, report on, and write about the policy and justice issues that fuel their own interests and passions, whether that involves immigration crises or poverty. Early on, students will share their interest areas with their classmates and start to share information and ideas. Students will then produce Final Stories on their topics of interest.\r\n\r\n<p>Student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis, students will substantively contribute to public discourse, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues that vulnerable peoples across this globe face.\r\n\r\n<p>With that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.", "end_date": "2016-07-19T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Journalism for Social Change", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Berkeley"], "commitment": "2 - 4 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/journalism-for-social-change_378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/journalism-social-change-uc-berkeleyx-j4sc101x-0", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Communication", "Social Sciences"], "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-01-19T00:00:00-05:00"},

Diwan, Salla Atkins", "description": "<p><span>For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-05-25T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["KIx: Karolinska Institutet"], "commitment": "~6 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/pragmatic-randomized-controlled-trials-in-health-care_378x225_0.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/pragmatic-randomized-controlled-trials-kix-kipractihx-0", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Biology & Life Sciences", "Health & Safety", "Medicine", "Data Analysis & Statistics"], "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-02-15T00:00:00-05:00"},

Contracts are promises that the law will enforce. But when will the law refuse to honor a promise? What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life —&nbsp;agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe course’s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service\"><span class=\"s2\">edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service</span></a>.

While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. “Future Cities” aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made “organism” with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. “Future Cities” will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space.

Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Overview and Basic Math (Homework 0: 10% of grade)</li>\r\n\t<li>Transformations (Homework 1: 20% of grade)</li>\r\n\t<li>OpenGL and Lighting (Homework 2: 35% of grade)</li>\r\n\t<li>Raytracing (Homework 3: 35% of grade)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the format of the class?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will the text of the lectures be available?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need to watch the lectures live?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can \"work ahead\" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much does it cost to take the course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What computer system do I need for the course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-10-05T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Computer Graphics", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["The University of California, San Diego"], "commitment": "12 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/cs184.1x-video-378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-uc-san-diegox-cse167x-1", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-05-01T00:00:00-04:00"},

We start by learning the mathematical definition of distance and use this to motivate the use of the singular value decomposition (SVD) for dimension reduction and multi-dimensional scaling and its connection to principle component analysis. We will learn about the <em>batch effect</em>: the most challenging data analytical problem in genomics today and describe how the techniques can be used to detect and adjust for batch effects. Specifically, we will describe the principal component analysis and factor analysis and demonstrate how these concepts are applied to data visualization and data analysis of high-throughput experimental data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we give a brief introduction to machine learning and apply it to high-throughput data. We describe the general idea behind clustering analysis and descript K-means and hierarchical clustering and demonstrate how these are used in genomics and describe prediction algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors along with the concepts of training sets, test sets, error rates and cross-validation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\">Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts.

This business and management course will cover all aspects of supply chain design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will start with learning how to design for the flow of physical products or goods. Variously referred to as Network Design, Facility Location, or Flow Optimization, the physical design is a core requirement for any supply chain planner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this, we will dive into the design of the financial flows involved with supply chains. Specifically, you will learn how to translate supply chain terms and metrics into financial terms used in the C-suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will then proceed into the design and management of the information flow of a supply chain by examining three critical phases: procurement, production, and demand planning. Our primary objective here is to understand how a business works with different partners in these three basic supply chain activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The procurement lessons will cover basic approaches as well as more advanced techniques such as combinatorial auctions and supply contracts. The production lessons will concentrate on material resource planning (MRP) and fixed horizon planning. The demand management lessons will examine collaboration as well as sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP). After covering the design of the three flows (physical, financial, and information), we will turn to the design of the supply chain organization itself as well as the metrics. Real cases and examples from practice will be used throughout the entire course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field.

That ecosystem of banks and financial markets (including Central Banks) has deepened in size, sophistication and complexity over the years.

On verra ce qui oppose le christianisme et la philosophie comme deux voies d’accès concurrentes à la vérité, avant d’envisager différents aspects de la dette du christianisme à l’égard de la philosophie antique.

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Chad Hansen", "description": "<p>We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.&nbsp; Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law – in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward – to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor – a natural dào.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural dào model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the dào of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance – Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-08-16T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["University of Hong Kong"], "commitment": "2-3 hours/week ", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/hku03x-2016-course-image_378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/humanity-nature-chinese-thought-hkux-hku03x-0", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Art & Culture", "Humanities", "Philosophy & Ethics"], "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-06-14T00:00:00-04:00"},

The EU is a major global actor in the field of human rights. EU treaties state that human rights are a fundamental value of the Union, which must be a silver thread in all its policies. The EU now acts within an impressive array of competences, and therefore has the potential to impact – positively or negatively – anyone’s human rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This EU and Human Rights course teaches the basics of human rights, placing the EU at the centre of investigation. The course will examine a number of key questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>What factors are key to making the EU a positive or a negative force for human rights? An example is the economic crisis: what impact has it had on people’s human rights in the EU and the world?</li>\r\n\t<li>Which actors, friends or foes, must the EU engage with to successfully promote human rights? Examples include NGOs, businesses, or other international organisations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations.</li>\r\n\t<li>In key policy sectors in which the EU is active, what is on balance the impact of the EU? Examples include trade, development, migration, social policy or international crisis management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the course activities aim to improve your understanding of how the EU, alone or in combination with other local or global, state or non-state actors, can better promote and uphold human rights worldwide. The course is intended for anyone interested in human rights and the EU, human rights law, European law, European Studies, international relations, global governance, etc. It is divided into four modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The EU and Human Rights: Value Promotion and Coherence</li>\r\n\t<li>Promoting Human Rights inside the EU</li>\r\n\t<li>Promoting Human Rights in EU External Action</li>\r\n\t<li>Capitalising on Success and Remedying Flaws</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is taught by leading academics, and the content is illustrated through interviews of practitioners in the field of the EU and human rights.

The XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves.

And we’ll uncover what’s gone wrong, in order to figure out new solutions that fit today’s workforce, economy, and society. We’ll also take you on a personal journey. You’ll learn what employers expect in today’s world of work – the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We’ll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and regulators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century. We’ll make this all come alive by highlighting the experiences, contributions, and aspirations of real people who are working right now to address these challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So join us, and let’s get started on shaping the future of work.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2016-05-13T00:00:00-04:00", "title": "Shaping the Future of Work", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["MIT"], "commitment": "3-5 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/future_of_work_378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/shaping-future-work-mitx-15-662x", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2016-03-28T00:00:00-04:00"},

The story is set in the Yukon, the far northern territory of Canada/Alaska, during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. During this period, good sled dogs were in high demand. The novel's main character is a dog named Buck, who lives on a California ranch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLondon himself lived nearly a year in the Yukon, collecting material for the novel. Like many older popular novels, <em>The Call of the Wild</em> was serialized in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> in the summer of 1903. A month later, it was released as a &nbsp;book. The novel’s great popularity and success made London famous. The appeal of this story comes from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1908, the story was adapted to film. Since then, there have been other adaptations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence.

The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging.

Los programas que se utilizaban eran costosos, con poca documentación y que exigían equipos informáticos de gama alta. Esto es ahora muy distinto; en concreto la biblioteca OpenCV, que se verá en el curso, constituyen una solución de altísimo nivel, gratuitas, portables a diversos sistemas operativos y equipos, ordenadores o teléfonos inteligentes y que constituyen <em>de facto</em> un estándar en la comunidad científica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Para que el alumnado pueda realizar diversas aplicaciones relacionadas con la Visión por Computador, a lo largo del curso se revisan los tipos básicos de elementos y sensores, viéndose las ventajas e inconvenientes de cada uno de ellos, así como las técnicas más usuales de procesar la información que proveen.

The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional \"theorem - proof\" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions</li>\r\n\t<li>laws of large numbers</li>\r\n\t<li>the main tools of Bayesian inference methods</li>\r\n\t<li>an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (<em>Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability</em>) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years.

Each unit contains between one and three lecture sequences. Each lecture sequence consists of short video clips, interleaved with short problems to test your understanding. Each unit also contains a wealth of supplementary material, including videos that go through the solution of various problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What textbook do I need for the course?</strong><br />\r\nNone - there is no required textbook.

Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will the text of the video clips be available?</strong><br />\r\nYes, we will provide transcripts of all clips (lectures, worked problems, etc.) that are synched to the videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How are grades assigned?</strong><br />\r\nGrades (Pass or Not Pass) are based on a combination of scores on the weekly homework assignments (11 total), two midterm exams, and a final exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much do I need to work for this class?</strong><br />\r\nThis is an ambitious class in that it covers a lot of material in substantial depth. Furthermore, the only way of mastering the subject is by actually solving on your own a fair number of problems.

We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will possess the knowledge to build your own arcade-style game from the ground up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the third time we have offered this course.

We will continue to use the Keil development system, and students will first develop/test in simulation followed by testing on the real board. 12 of the 14 labs will be essentially the same and two labs will be upgraded. Same as last year, students will need to complete at least seven of the labs on the real board to achieve certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will the Spring 2016 course be <em>different</em> from the course run Spring 2015? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time we will make minor changes to a few labs to enhance the fun and focus the learning on embedded systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is this class related to a campus course of The University of Texas at Austin? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, this course corresponds to the Electrical and Computer Engineering course EE319K Introduction to Embedded Systems, which is a required course offered in the freshman year to all ECE students and some BME students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there a textbook associated with this class? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The class is based on the textbook Embedded Systems: Introduction to ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers ISBN: 978-1477508992. However, the purchase of the textbook is not required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need a Windows PC? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, any system running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 will be ok. Furthermore, with a third party virtualization software like Parallels or VMware Fusion, one can install the Windows operating system on a Mac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much does it cost to take this class? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does not cost anything to take the class. However, since this a lab-based class, there is a lab kit you will purchase. You will also have the option of obtaining an ID Verified certificate for a $50 fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much does the kit cost? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US one can purchase the microcontroller board and parts for about $40 USD plus shipping. There is also an optional graphics display for an additional $10 USD plus shipping. The optional graphics display will make the last lab a lot more fun. The CC3100 Boosterpack costs $20 USD plus shipping and will be required if you wish to complete the Wifi lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I take this course without buying the kit? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, there are three approaches to taking this class.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>You could listen to the videos, read the assignments, and play with the interactive learning tools.</li>\r\n\t<li>The second option involves installing the Keil uVision integrated development environment on a Windows PC, and performing the lab assignments in simulation mode.</li>\r\n\t<li>The third option, which fully captures the essence of embedded systems, can be done by performing the lab assignments on a real system that you will purchase.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I use another microcontroller? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are following approach one, where you are listening to the videos, reading the assignments and playing with the interactive tools, then you can use any microcontroller. However, if you wish to obtain certification, you will need to use the Tiva series TM4C123 so you can interact with the automatic graders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does it mean for the display to be optional? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last lab you will build an arcade-style game. We expect most students will connect the microcontroller board to the PC. In this manner the game output can be displayed on a window of the PC. However, for about $10 USD plus shipping, you can order a small Nokia 5110 LCD display so your game can be operated in a stand-alone fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will this course really take 10 hours per week? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first option of just listening, reading and playing with interactive animations will take two or three hours per week.

Led by international best-selling authors and professors from The University of British Columbia’s world-renowned Creative Writing MFA program, this is the first in a series of courses designed to take your novel from concept to completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outlining is a crucial step in the novel writing process, one that fuels creativity and prepares the writer to stay on track and avoid common pitfalls. Through hands-on weekly exercises with a focus on craft and process, as well as insights from the real-world practices of accomplished authors, this course explores the core elements of fiction writing necessary to build an outline. You will learn the fundamentals of character development, world-building and the basics of storytelling architecture. You'll work intensively on your own creative project and hone your outline through feedback and discussion with fellow writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the tradition of the UBC MFA program, this course draws on the work habits of established authors to help writers move quickly toward creating a blueprint for a successful draft. Whether you’re seeking literary fame or working on a project to share with family and friends, this course offers the tools and skills necessary to plan a novel others will be excited to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is recommended for professional and aspiring writers, writing groups, participants in NaNoWriMo, teachers and anyone who has ever dreamed of writing a novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need to have started a novel to take this course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. However, you should have one or more novel ideas that you wish to work on during this course. We will ask you to start developing your idea right away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if I’m in the middle of a novel?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have already started a novel, or are having issues with a partially finished manuscript without an outline, this course can help you clarify your intentions and work out structural issues.

It covers Newton’s Laws, Kinematics, Energy, Momentum, Rigid Body Rotation, and Angular Momentum. The course covers applications of these basic principles to simple harmonic motion, orbital motion, and to problems that involve more than one basic principle.&nbsp;These principles also underlie the 12 online laboratory activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our emphasis is on helping students learn expert-like ways of solving challenging problems, many of which are similar to problems on previous Advanced Placement Examinations in Mechanics C. We stress a key insight: mechanics is about forces changing motion. We apply this concept to organizing the core knowledge in a way that helps students apply it to sophisticated multi-concept problems. We feel this is the best way to prepare students for success not only on the AP Examination but also in other college-level science, technology, engineering and math courses that emphasize problem-solving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>If you are a teacher looking to learn better ways to teach your students, or are interested in using some of our MOOC materials in your own classroom—possibly as a private online course for your students—we strongly encourage you to sign up for our teacher’s discussion cohort, a “private discussion room” for teachers to share pedagogical ideas and instructional techniques.To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher by clicking this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JHEtfeghB27CWPqOnvUxbWW3I2izvAiyMFNbJVNCBKw/viewform\">link</a></span><span>, and we will enroll you in the teacher’s discussion cohort.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long is this course?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course consists of 13 weeks of required (graded) material and 2 weeks of&nbsp;optional (ungraded) material.

A complete eText, including worked-examples and some video lectures, is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable.

Each category is worth a varying number of points; and you are allowed several attempts on each problem.

However, just&nbsp;<em>using</em>&nbsp;a computer is only a small part of the picture.

It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating).

A cidade está criando trabalho, está inovando, está repensando seus sistemas de saúde e educação, transporte, está fazendo frente às mudanças do clima, está abrindo espaços para o debate e a socialização. Para que esse dinamismo possa traduzir-se em um fenômeno exitoso, a cidade deve aprender a planejar seu presente pensando em seu futuro, buscando o equilíbrio entre crescimento econômico, a inclusão social e o respeito ao meio ambiente. É, portanto, responsabilidade das cidades melhorar a qualidade de vida das gerações presentes sem comprometer o bem estar das gerações futuras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Com o objetivo de responder a este desafio, o BID criou um curso que busca fortalecer os conhecimentos e capacidades dos participantes em gerir o desenvolvimento sustentável de suas cidades. E para isso, o curso parte da premissa que a sustentabilidade das cidades só será alcançada por meio de uma perspectiva integrada e intersetorial; uma perspectiva integral, onde se trabalhe de maneira conjunta os desafios econômicos, fiscais, urbanos, ambientais, institucionais e de governabilidade das cidades junto com uma perspectiva intersetorial, onde as diferentes áreas e níveis de governo se coordenem e que se articulem com o setor privado e com a sociedade civil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Com o objetivo de entender melhor essa perspectiva, o curso analisa a situação, os desafios setoriais e intersetoriais que as cidades encontram na gestão das principais áreas de sua competência: finanças subnacionais, desenvolvimento produtivo, planejamento urbano, transporte, segurança cidadã, água, ar etc. Desta forma, com o objetivo de abordar o planejamento do desenvolvimento sustentável das cidades médias latino americanas, o curso apresenta a “Iniciativa Cidades Emergentes e Sustentáveis”, uma ferramenta de gestão que permite dar sentido ao trabalho analítico das dimensões/desafios de forma integrada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assim como na América Latina e no Caribe, o Brasil possui grandes desafios ambientais, urbanos e fiscais para a sustentabilidade de suas cidades. Dentre eles se destacam os altos índices de violência - 25,8 mortes violentas por 100 mil habitantes segundo o Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública; a desigualdade urbana, uma vez que o país é o 4º mais desigual da América Latina e Caribe; e a vulnerabilidade diante de desastres naturais, onde se calcula, por exemplo, que a reconstrução das cidades cariocas devastadas pelas enchentes e pelos deslizamentos de 2011 custou 1,3% do PIB do estado do Rio de Janeiro; ou ainda, degradação ambiental, com um índice de 63% de esgoto sendo lançado nos corpos hídricos sem nenhum tratamento, segundo o MCidades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Além de fornecer conceitos e uma visão abrangente da situação do Brasil em relação à sustentabilidade das cidades, neste curso serão abordados alguns desafios dos municípios, bem como exemplos práticos de como esses problemas estão sendo enfrentados.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2015-12-15T00:00:00-05:00", "title": "Liderando o Desenvolvimento Sustentável das Cidades", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Inter-American Development Bank"], "commitment": "6 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/idb4.1x-course_card_image-378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/liderando-o-desenvolvimento-sustentavel-idbx-idb4-1x", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Economics & Finance", "Business & Management"], "duration": "6 semanas", "language_name": ["Others"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2015-11-03T00:00:00-05:00"},

Et nous vous montrerons quels sont les ingrédients qui ont permis à leurs œuvres d’avoir été sans cesse lues et jouées jusqu’à aujourd’hui — et cela, alors même que de nombreux éléments-clés (l’obéissance à des \"règles\"&nbsp;et l’usage du vers dit \"alexandrin,\"&nbsp;en particulier) ont disparu depuis longtemps.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2015-11-20T00:00:00-05:00", "title": "À la découverte du théâtre classique français – Tome 1", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Sorbonne University System"], "commitment": "3-5 heures/semaine", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/lf001.1x-course_image-378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/la-decouverte-du-theatre-classique-sorbonnex-lf001-1x", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Humanities", "Literature", "History"], "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["Others"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2015-10-15T00:00:00-04:00"},

Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path,&nbsp;<em>la diritta via</em>, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dante’s<em>&nbsp;Paradiso</em>&nbsp;maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person’s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law—the law of relational identity, where “all are responsible to all for all.” Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the<em>&nbsp;Paradiso</em>&nbsp;is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the<em>&nbsp;Paradiso&nbsp;</em>that unless we have become used to eat the “bread of Angels,” we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the&nbsp;<em>Inferno</em>.

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Clayton Cook", "description": "<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it’s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>3D geometry,</li>\r\n\t<li>probabilistic state estimation,</li>\r\n\t<li>visual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,</li>\r\n\t<li>linear control.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.

Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system. Since a city can´t be visualized in only one perspective, this course tackles some of its individual sectors to obtain the&nbsp;key performance indicators that are essential to improving&nbsp;the quality of life, including: urbanization, communication, education, and economy. Quantifying that data is useful for estimating consumed resources, forecasting shortages, and correcting damage in a timely manner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce participants understand the importance of a Smart City and its classifications, they will learn to identify the impact of using metrics to measure its performance.&nbsp;A very important skill to develop is how to classify a metric&nbsp;and to identify its units or measure. The main focus of this course is to develop participants’ basic knowledge of a Smart City by being able to identify the parameters involved in its creation.

The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. &nbsp;Statistics can be confusing and opaque. &nbsp;Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it—from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials.

If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children’s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior.

Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a “school of contemplation,” where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one’s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante’s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a “whole person” more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante’s&nbsp;<em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the&nbsp;<em>Purgatorio&nbsp;</em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante’s poetry here places within our reach.

It is an exercise in the deliberation of issues, persuasion, and the polling of results. <strong>JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change</strong> is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous. \u2028Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be ‘Unhangout,’ a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab. Many other opportunities for gathering, deliberating, and returning results are also available, including face-to-face gathering and asynchronous deliberation online using open social media like Facebook and Loomio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is ultimately about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication.

In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies.

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Iain Stewart, Saif Rayyan, Daniel Kolodrubetz, Evangelos Sfakianakis", "description": "<p>8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course, and students at MIT or Harvard can also register for 8.S851 for course credit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Course Flow</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30 minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade eight presentations from among their fellow students. Of these eight, you will view 5 presentations that will be chosen for you, and you will view at least 3 more that you choose yourself from among the available topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since this is a graduate course we anticipate that learning the subject, and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Since some of you may find a grade useful, we will compute a grade for everyone by using a combination of homework problems (50%) and your final research presentation project (50%). &nbsp;For many of the course elements you may work at your own pace. The presentation project will be due December 16th.&nbsp; For those following the suggested schedule there is a one-week break over the Christmas &amp; New Years holiday, and two homework problems that are due in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What do I have to buy in order to participate in the course?</span>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nothing.

If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen \"just by chance\"? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever.

The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much time will the course take?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously the answer will depend on your background and motivation to master the course material. Each week will consist of 5 or 6 segments that will each take 5 to 10 minutes to watch or listen to once. There will be some exploratory questions for each lesson and a confirmation quiz for each week. There will be one exploratory activity for each week. The average commitment will be 2-3 hours per week with perhaps 20 hours required for the whole course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What background does the course assume?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll ask you to pull out a calculator from time to time (but not all the time!) simply as this will help you really master the key ideas. The key thing is to have a curiosity and interest in what makes our planet tick!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What kind of learning activities will the course involve?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities are designed to use basic household objects, and our own senses, to engage with observations of the world, and to think about what these mean and lead to. We’ll get you to sense how cold or warm different objects get when left in the sun, and to observe how energy explains things we see and hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What difference will the course make to my life?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course has the conviction that it is hard to care for or value things that we don’t appreciate or have never considered. Although harsh in certain places and times, the Earth’s surface is remarkably habitable. Many forms of life can make their way in many kinds of terrain and climate. What produces these conditions? How are they maintained? We will seek to answer those questions in rudimentary form at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What conversations will the course help to perform? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courses often imagine a context in which the course material is discussed, and this one is no different. It imagines a setting with family or friends where you might have just learned of a news event involving a storm like a hurricane or thunderstorm, or where a community might have experienced a flood or a drought, or merely unusual weather. You might have heard of El Nino or climate change in the news. This course will give you a background to better engage in a conversation about these great matters, and offer a better sense of the complexity, challenge and wonder connected to living on the surface of such an energetic planet.</p>\r\n", "end_date": "2013-12-08T00:00:00-05:00", "title": "Our Energetic Earth", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["University of Toronto"], "commitment": "2-3 hours/week\t(6 weeks)", "cover_url": "https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/promoted/oee-378x225.jpg", "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/energetic-earth-university-torontox-oee101x", "currency": null, "subject_name": ["Energy & Earth Sciences", "Engineering", "Environmental Studies", "Science"], "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edx"], "start_date": "2013-10-28T00:00:00-04:00"},

The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students’ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students’ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. 该课程是“北大-德稻网络开放课程”中的一门，由北京大学与德稻教育联合提供。</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can I get access to reading materials?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please download the materials from designated websites.
