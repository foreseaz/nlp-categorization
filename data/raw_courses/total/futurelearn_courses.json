It draws upon the experience of staff from the Mathematics Education Centre at Loughborough University - a centre that has specialised for many years in mathematics teaching and mathematics support for science and engineering students who find the transition to university mathematics particularly challenging.\nThrough an accessible introduction to graphical and algebraic techniques students will start to think mathematically and develop an informal understanding of vital properties of points, lines and curves before formalising mathematically some of these essential notions. We adopt a user-friendly approach and describe mathematical processes in everyday language. New ideas are developed by example and discovery rather than by formal proof.  Further development will introduce the equation of a line and the significance of its slope and vertical intercept.\nThe course will close by reinforcing the importance of mathematics to science and engineering. It will pave the way into the study of calculus by explaining that engineers and scientists need to build upon the ideas introduced in order to describe, analyse and predict the behaviour of physical, biological and technological systems.\nWhat will you do ?\n\nwatch video explanations of key mathematical ideas\nhear from leading scientists and engineers about the importance of mathematics to their work\nwatch fully worked mathematical examples\ntry to solve mathematics problems yourself\nlearn how to plot points and straight line graphs and  use these lines to solve problems\ntest your progress with quizzes\ntry to apply what you have learned\nshare ideas with other learners on the course\nprepare yourself well for embarking upon a science or engineering course\n\nProfessor Tony Croft has written two blogs posts which talk about the role this free online course might play in helping to prepare young people for the mathematical demands of university courses in STEM subjects:\nTrying to make it all add up: preparing young people for the mathematical demands of university\nBreaking into science and engineering: strengthening mathematical foundations\n", "end_date": "2016-09-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Getting a Grip on Mathematical Symbolism", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Loughborough University"], "commitment": "2 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/95/49/regular_95497a58-f83d-4043-992d-1fea57d922ca.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mathematical-symbolism?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"},

So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.\nThis two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals, researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.\nDelivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines and effect behaviour change. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.\nBy the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:\n1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines\n2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.\nThe learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.\nSuccess and feedback from the course\nSince April 2014 over 10,000 learners registered on this course from across the world. There has been a rich multidisciplinary range of healthcare professionals, including primary and secondary care pharmacists, doctors, nurses and dentists, alongside patients and carers. Following the course, learners indicated that they agreed or strongly agreed that:\n\n\nthey had gained skills and knowledge from the course that will allow them to work more effectively with patients with medicines adherence issues (94%).\n\n\nthe course would enable them to respond to medicines adherence issues with greater confidence (93%).\n\n\nthe course had added a fresh perspective to their current role (95%).\n\n\nthey would recommend the course to a colleague or friend (97%).\n\n\n", "end_date": "2016-03-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Medicines Adherence: Supporting Patients with Their Treatment", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["King's College London"], "commitment": "2 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ba/98/regular_ba980fde-35b9-4e6a-b2d5-c6241c905570.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/medicinesadherence?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00Z"},

We are victims of an ‘illusion of mental depth’ - we imagine that our thoughts and behaviours arise from hidden motives and beliefs, and that we can understand ourselves by somehow uncovering these hidden forces, whether through therapy, lab experiments or brain scanning.\nThis course will suggest that this conception is not entirely correct, that we’re inventing these motives and beliefs at the very moment of decision. Professor Chater’s central proposition will be  that there is no mental depth, that mental depth is an illusion.\nUnderstand mystifying aspects of human behaviour\nThis course consists of six weeks of material. Each week we’ll start with a paradox, some mystifying aspect of human behaviour, before looking at insights into it, gained over decades of psychological and behavioural research. You’ll have a chance to try out a classic psychological experiment online.\nSome of the really exciting things we’ll be looking at are:\n\nwhy we take risks and why we fear them;\nhow people succeed or fail to work with other people successfully;\nhow our behaviour, governed by a plethora of complicated psychological forces, makes sense at all;\nthe theory that we are creating an improvised character and trying to stay in our role;\nand finally, how we can make society more coherent and create a better world.\n\nMeet behavioural science experts from academia, government and industry\nYou’ll learn from Warwick Business School’s leading behavioural science group, as well as a diverse range of people who have thought very deeply in a practical context about the nature of human behaviour.\nWe’ll be talking to Rory Sutherland, ad man and behavioural economics impresario; Tim Harford, the Financial Times undercover columnist; Gus O’Donnell, former head of the Civil Service; and many other senior representatives in high-profile organisations.\nWhat previous learners say\nOver 72,000 learners from across the world have joined previous runs of this course, and below are a few examples of the impact it had on them:\n\n“Absolutely enjoyed every single minute of the course.

But perhaps the most obvious (and often overlooked) quality required of all sound engineers is the ability to listen.\nSound engineers must constantly evaluate the sound quality of individual sound sources in a mix and evaluate how these sound sources interrelate with one another. The ability to listen critically and make these judgements is a skill that must be learnt through trial and error and repeated practice. This free online course aims to provide you with tools for developing and refining the critical listening skills relevant to contemporary sound engineering and will be of interest to musicians, sound enthusiasts and experienced sound engineers alike.\nThe course begins by examining the nature of sound and how properties of sound (frequency, amplitude and sound intensity, for example) are expressed. The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined. The remainder of the course focuses on the signal processing techniques commonly used by sound engineers when mixing multitrack recordings - for example, equalisation, compression and reverberation.\nOn completion of the course you will have a thorough understanding of the workflow involved when mixing a multitrack recording and will have developed the critical listening skills necessary to make informed judgements regarding individual and overall sound quality.\n", "end_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "Critical Listening for Studio Production", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Queen's University Belfast"], "commitment": "3 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/1e/8d/regular_1e8dd8dd-54e0-4c07-a4b1-530a752db8bd.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/critical-listening-for-studio-production?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-12T00:00:00Z"},

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Jon McCormack", "description": "Learning to program is no longer just for computer specialists and software developers. People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill.\nOne of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding,” this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression.\nSo if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this free online course extremely useful.\nExplore the concepts and skills of creative coding\nThroughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write.\nThe aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs.\nEach week we’ll start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound. You’ll learn how to interact with them to change their behaviour, creating increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques.\nLearn with professional artists and designers\nWe will also look at how leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them.\nThe course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as:\n\nCan a computer be independently creative?\nWho is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program?\nHow is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology?\nDoes the computer bring anything that is really new to art?\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.\n(Image © 2010 Jon McCormack)\n", "end_date": "2016-09-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "Creative Coding", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Monash University"], "commitment": "6 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/8e/98/regular_8e98b3b7-689e-457a-95ac-c1523d7d5242.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z"},

You will learn about the techniques and find out more about the history of physical theatre including Meyerhold’s contribution to its development and how, nearly 100 years later, his work is still influencing us today.\nThrough a mixture of video, animation, interviews with artists, expert panel discussions with professionals, discussion forums and practical exercises you will explore the range of key players in Russian actor training. Meyerhold’s work will be placed in context as an early collaborator with Stanislavsky and a contemporary of Michael Chekhov. You will be introduced to one of his études – a two minute repeatable exercise used to develop balance, awareness and expression. Responding to video guidance you will be invited to explore your own response to this unique approach to training and will share these with the experts and your fellow students. Together we will reflect on these responses, evaluating the importance of Meyerhold’s work today.\nWhat others say\nThis is a re-run of this highly successful course. Here are just a few of the comments taken from a longer review written by Claire Warden, author of ‘British Avant-Garde Theatre’ who took the course in March 2014\n“…I can honestly say that the past week has been a revelation. Not only has the teaching been clear, it has also attacked such a range of ideas in an intellectually rigorous way…”\n“I studied alongside students from across the world…The supportive, cross-cultural community…was wholly unexpected and reflected Meyerhold’s transnational intentions”\n“An amazing course that has been thoroughly enjoyable and informative”\nThe following comment is one of many similar comments made by other students who joined the course in March.\n“My grateful thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make such an enriching experience possible - first rate!”\nAccreditation\nThis course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management.\n\n\n“The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.”\nAgha Hasan Abedi\n\n\nThink back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.\nSo how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.\nWe will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path.\n\n\n“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet”\nHenry Mintzberg\n\n\nWho is this course for?\nThe course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial.\nThe depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate.\nWhat might I learn and how might this benefit me?\n\nHow to manage people and get them engaged.\nHow to get the best out of people.\nWhat good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection.\nTools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face.\n\nWhat will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me?\nThe course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience.\nYou must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches. Indeed, sharing your experiences and reflections with others on the course will help you to get the most out of it.\nDelivered by the Henley Business School\nThis course will be delivered by Henley Business School, a triple accredited, world-renowned business school, part of the University of Reading.

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Bill Davies", "description": "In this course, we introduce the issue of food security and explore some of the different ways in which it has been described both in research and in practice and consider key concerns for the future.\nOur central concern is ‘How we will feed an extra two billion people by the middle of this century?’ Focussing both on UK agriculture and on food supply chains in other parts of the world, we will examine how food has shaped our environmental and social landscapes. We will see that, while everyone would agree that food security is ‘a good thing’, ideas about what it means in practice and how it should be achieved vary tremendously.\nProposed developments to address global food insecurity range from technological inventions in the efficacy of large-scale agriculture through social and cultural innovations in local food production and consumption. You’ll be exploring a number of topics that address many issues including:\n\nIs food security really just about food? \nShould we have concerns about health, social justice, environmental degradation and cultural diversity? \nWhat is the role of technology and innovation in promoting food security? \n\nAnd much more.\nIn the final week we explore the big picture by considering food systems and food chains as a whole. Using examples from some of the case studies that we’ve explored, we consider the relationships between production and consumption and question whether particular kinds of agriculture are linked to particular diets and patterns of consumption.\nWe will explore the role of the retailer and the consumer in more detail as we ask what it means to enjoy a safe, healthy, sustainable diet. We also consider the issue of food poverty and how this fits within the food security debate.\nYou can use the hashtag #FLfoodsecurity to join and contribute to Twitter conversations about this course.\nProfessor Bill Davies has written a blog post about the course in which he argues that we need a new “Green Revolution” if we’re going to feed the world’s growing population.\n", "end_date": "2016-10-24T00:00:00Z", "title": "Global Food Security: Addressing the Challenge", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Lancaster University"], "commitment": "3 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/74/1a/regular_741a7f06-e579-4f08-8bc0-a2efb60c4a7a.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/food-security?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-08-29T00:00:00Z"},

The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.\nThis six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.\nDrawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:\n\nthe factors that determine the survival of evidence\nthe different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation\nthe planning of archaeological projects\nexcavation techniques\nand the detailed study of structures and artefacts.\n\nAs part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome’s most famous frontier.\nFind out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the FutureLearn blog.\n", "end_date": "2015-12-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Newcastle University"], "commitment": "4 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/fe/a9/regular_fea9b9a3-bed1-4ec2-9af6-ba1148e29aea.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hadrians-wall?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z"},

This course is a first step to develop yourself into one of the future’s key decision makers or to enhance your decision-making skills.\nFirst, this course will address what complexity is and will define uncertainty. Next, we cover a number of tools and methods to understand and be able to navigate through the complex and uncertain world.\nThe need for a multidisciplinary approach will be emphasised throughout the course. Guest lecturers from different faculties will explain, provide applications and examples from their respective fields of study for a more comprehensive understanding of the different elements of complexity. For example, complexity can be beautifully explained by the use of insects and brains and many other natural and social phenomena. The same ideas can be applied to economic and financial systems.\nAfter introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modelling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently entrepreneurship. Finally, relating this all back together in two case studies will conclude the course. The first case study is financial stability and crises and the latter is growth and development of cities.\nBy completing this course you will have developed skills and knowledge that will enhance your decision-making skills in order to act in a complex world and under uncertainty.\nThis course has received a major update in 2016 with added content on agent-based modelling, entrepreneurship and city planning.\n", "end_date": "2016-10-24T00:00:00Z", "title": "Decision Making in a Complex and Uncertain World", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["University of Groningen"], "commitment": "5 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f6/28/regular_f6280438-ac86-4f67-9ff2-6d5bdda3e9ea.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/complexity-and-uncertainty?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"},

Each week is split into bite-sized chunks, taking less than 30 minutes per day.  You’ll watch videos, read articles, answer questions, do tests and quizzes, and discuss problems with other learners and help them with their problems too.\nYou’ll learn maths skills like: calculus (integration, differentiation, and solving differential equations); trigonometry (e.g. resolving forces); and geometry (calculating where things are).  You’ll learn laws of physics like Newton’s laws of motion and the laws of thermodynamics.  Finally, you’ll see how these tools and principles allow engineers to design: planes, cars, skyscrapers, bridges, dams, ICT networks, self-healing materials, robots, water treatment systems, wind turbines, hydro-power systems, biofuel plants.\nThe course is designed to be adaptable to your needs with quick questions (to check knowledge) and optional work sheets (so you can focus on areas that are new to you or practise skills that you want to improve).

For those interested in extending their learning it will also provide a taster course for an exciting new MA in Character Education currently being developed by the University of Birmingham.\nLearn with academic experts and practising teachers\nWe will draw on the insights of academics from the Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues within the School of Education at the University of Birmingham.  These leading experts in the fields of character education and virtue ethics will help you explore the theoretical and philosophical basis for character education, including a background to virtue ethics.\nYou’ll also meet teachers and head teachers with first-hand experience of the transformative power of implementing character education in day-to-day practices within a school.  They’ll discuss how character might be taught in a conscious, planned and reflective way, enabling you to gain practical knowledge on taking character education into educational settings.\nYou can learn according to your interests and at your convenience.  Each week has been divided into activities which can be completed together or individually:\nWeek 1: An Introduction to Character Education\n\n\nWhat is character education and why does it matter? (Professor James Arthur)\n\n\nWhat is the philosophical basis for character education and what virtues constitute good character?  (Professor Kristján Kristjánsson)\n\n\nWeek 2: Character Education in Practice\n\n\nHow can character be ‘caught’ in schools? (Gary Walsh, Head Teacher)\n\n\nWhy should character be taught in schools? (Dan Wright, Teaching Fellow)\n\n\nYou can also explore each area in as much depth as you wish, with further reading materials available to those who want to learn more about particular aspects of the course.\nYou can find out more about what to expect from this course in a guest post from a religious studies and wellbeing teacher, Matthew Bawden, on the FutureLearn blog: “Everyone’s talking about character education, but what does it really mean for teachers?”\n", "end_date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "What is Character?

Alarmingly, the combined impacts of rapid population growth and climate change are now posing a severe threat to the liveability and resilience of our cities.\nA new approach to urban design\nHowever, it is possible to design water systems that provide cities with the capacity to cope with these threats. So-called “water sensitive urban design” creates water sensitive cities that enhance and protect the health of watercourses and wetlands; mitigate flood risk and damage; and create public spaces that harvest, clean and recycle water.\nThis approach poses complex planning and urban design challenges. And it requires solutions that address equally complex and interrelated considerations, such as social, environmental, political, economic, planning and engineering disciplines.\nLearn from a team of experts\nYou’ll hear from leading researchers and thought-leaders in Australia and internationally about key actions in delivering water sensitive cities. You’ll consider and discuss the latest solutions and concepts on urban design and modelling, climate change adaptation, behaviour change, and social and government engagement.  Specifically, you’ll consider:\n\nthe emerging challenges facing our cities\nhow water sensitive cities can be the driver for more resilient cities\nhow water can be managed in our cities to improve their liveability\nthe potential for stormwater, urban aquatic systems, and green infrastructure to improve the urban climate\nhow changes in human behaviour and institutions can complement and assist transitions to water sensitive cities.\n\nA practical course\nWe’ll focus on effective ways to create water sensitive cities as we draw upon case studies from Australia and around the world.

Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.\nDuring this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We’ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.\nWe then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?\nFinally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?\nAt the end of the course you will have improved you understanding of the costs and benefits of shale gas, and you will have made your contribution to the public debate on this important topic.\nKeep up to date with announcements and discussions by following the course on Twitter @ShaleGas_MOOC.

According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.\nOur point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.\nIn the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.\nThe third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Assessing the reasons we are given to do or believe these things calls upon us to think critically and logically.\nImprove your logical and critical thinking skills\nEven though we’re called upon to use our critical and logical thinking skills all the time, most of us are not that good at it. This free online course aims to help you develop and improve these skills.\nYou’ll learn how to:\n\nidentify and avoid common thinking mistakes that lead to the formation of bad beliefs;\nrecognise, reconstruct and evaluate arguments;\nuse basic logical tools to analyse arguments;\nand apply those tools in areas including science, moral theories and law.\n\nAssociate Professor Tim Dare and Dr Patrick Girard from the University of Auckland take us on an informative and engaging eight week journey through the worlds of logical and critical thinking helping us to avoid these common obstacles and fallacies and improve our logical and critical thinking skills.\nThroughout the course, Tim and Patrick provide videos, articles, and assignments to lead us through the thickets of logical and critical thinking.\nWe will spend the first half of the course exploring key concepts in logical and critical thinking. In the second half of the course, we will apply those concepts in familiar areas, to help you develop practical and useful logical and critical thinking skills.\nWe begin, in the first week, with an introduction to logical and critical thinking and common obstacles and fallacies.\nIn week two Patrick introduces arguments.  We learn to identify premises and conclusions – components of a good argument – and by the end of this week we’ll be able to construct an argument in standard form.\nIn week three we will learn how to distinguish between deductive and non-deductive arguments and about validity, invalidity, strength and weakness.\nIn week four we examine good and bad arguments in more detail, learning how to tell when an argument is sound or cogent, and how to evaluate an argument.\nWeeks five to seven examine three familiar areas – science, law, and morality – that call upon our logical and critical thinking skills in ways appropriate to the particular demands of those areas.\nFinally in week eight we will apply the lessons of the course to an argument “in the wild”, seeing how the skills we have developed over our eight-week journey can be used in our own lives.\nBy the end of the course, you will have acquired the basic skills to assess arguments logically and critically, and so to be in a better situation to own the reasons for your beliefs.\nYou can find out more in Patrick’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “What can the New Zealand flag teach us about logical and critical thinking?”\n", "end_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Logical and Critical Thinking", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["The University of Auckland"], "commitment": "4 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/a4/5e/regular_a45e1791-4619-4c75-a5eb-98ee33da42b1.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/logical-and-critical-thinking?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"},

The reading load will be flexible, and you will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and feelings via the online discussions with other learners.\nTogether, we’ll explore six themes:\n\n\nStress: In poetry, the word “stress” refers to the emphasis of certain syllables in a poem’s metre. How might the metrical “stresses” of poetry help us to cope with the mental and emotional stresses of modern life?\n\n\nHeartbreak: Is heartbreak a medical condition? What can Sidney’s sonnets and Austen’s Sense and Sensibility teach us about suffering and recovering from a broken heart?\n\n\nBereavement: The psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross famously proposed that there are five stages of grief. How might Shakespeare’s Hamlet and poems by Wordsworth and Hardy help us to think differently about the process of grieving?\n\n\nTrauma: PTSD or “shellshock” has long been associated with the traumatic experiences of soldiers in World War 1. How is the condition depicted in war poetry of the era? Can poems and plays offer us an insight into other sources of trauma, including miscarriage and assault?\n\n\nDepression and Bipolar: The writer Rachel Kelly subtitles her memoir Black Rainbow “how words healed me – my journey through depression”. Which texts have people turned to during periods of depression, and why? What can we learn from literature about the links between bipolar disorder and creativity?\n\n\nAgeing and Dementia: One of the greatest studies of ageing in English Literature is Shakespeare’s King Lear. Is it helpful to think about this play in the context of dementia? Why are sufferers of age-related memory loss often still able to recall the poems they have learned “by heart”?\n\n\nLeading you through the course and readings will be:\n\n\nDr Paula Byrne: One of the world’s leading Jane Austen experts, who conceived of this course while researching how Austen’s novels were prescribed to victims of shellshock in World War 1.\n\n\nProfessor Jonathan Bate: A critic, biographer and reviewer; Man Booker Prize judge; and author of a prize-winning biography of the poet, John Clare, and Being Shakespeare - the hit one-man play for Simon Callow. Jonathan is also the Lead Educator on the immensely successful Shakespeare and his World FutureLearn course.\n\n\nAlong the way, you’ll also hear from doctors, who offer a medical perspective on the conditions discussed in the course, as well as from a range people who have turned to literature at moments of crisis, including such well-known figures as Melvyn Bragg, Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry.\nYou’ll have the opportunity to share your own experiences, discover new texts, and take part in activities that explore the relationship between reading and wellbeing. Start now by following the link to Professor Jonathan Bate and Dr Paula Byrne’s article for the FutureLearn blog ‘Can you find solace in a sonnet?’, where you can reflect on the calming and reassuring powers of a short poem.\nCome and join the conversation.\nLearner comments\nWe have had such a hugely positive reaction to the course. Here are just a few of the wonderful comments learners have said about the course so far:\n\n“I [have] loved this course, thank you. It has reminded me of the power of words to lift us up and that express emotions and conditions that can be hard to deal with. I have been inspired to read and write more poetry as a result. Thank you again!” - Susan Perry\n\n\n“Thoroughly enjoyed the course and found it really rewarding. Excellent content and food for thought. I can’t praise it highly enough. I’m now totally convinced about the impact literature can have on mental health. I know it will help more people in future - literature, art and music has a tremendous power to help healing and promote mental well-being. It is a lifeline and a wonderful coping mechanism. It’s been great to learn from and share experiences with all the delegates too.” - Dr. Rachael Turner\n\n\n“I have have enjoyed this course immensely. It’s given me a new outlook on life and even the courage to read new and exciting things and to even enjoy a wider range of materials I’ve ever thought of. A really wonderful experience and I’ve loved the feedback and comments from fellow course members.” - Amanda Bedwell\n\n", "end_date": "2016-10-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "Literature and Mental Health: Reading for Wellbeing", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["The University of Warwick"], "commitment": "4 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/b0/07/regular_b0076fe6-0fc8-4d25-a5e5-aadf3109be79.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/literature?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"},

This course offers an insight into two of the most commonly diagnosed mental health difficulties: anxiety and depression.\nThis five week course will improve your understanding and knowledge around depression and anxiety, dispel some common myths about these disorders, and introduce you to a leading, effective treatment for both disorders, called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (or ‘CBT’ for short).\nUnderstanding depression and anxiety\nGetting to grips with depression and anxiety is a learning journey.  In order to fully understand these difficulties we first need to understand how we process and make sense of the world around us, and how our emotional state may play an active role in this process. During the first week, we will explore this in more detail and there will be opportunities to consolidate your learning with a number of relevant practical activities.\nWe will then look at depression and anxiety in turn, and will consider: how these disorders differ from ‘normal’ emotional states, highlight associated signs and symptoms, and explore some of the factors which may be responsible for maintaining these difficulties using a cognitive behavioural framework.\nThe final two weeks will be devoted to illustrating how CBT can be used to treat depression and anxiety.\nEach week you’ll have the opportunity to engage in activities to help you apply the knowledge you gain on the course. There will be information to download, and interviews with experts and patients to help you understand more about these common disorders and one of the ways in which they can be successfully treated.\nIt is important to emphasise that this online course is not intended to be a self-help ‘treatment’ for anyone experiencing anxiety or depression, nor can the information within it be used to formally ‘diagnose’ yourself or anyone else displaying symptoms of anxiety or depression.

But did you know that 3D printing is also enabling life-saving and transforming medical procedures, which were unthinkable a few years ago?\nWelcome to the world of 3D printed body parts\nThe world of medicine and biomaterials has collided with advances in 3D printing. In a recent case, an infant was born with a rare and life-threatening birth defect, and was unable to breath unaided. A CT scan of the boy’s airways was used to 3D print a bio-sleeve, which was a perfect fit for his bronchus. The material used dissolves in the body, giving the boy’s bronchus time to grow strong, before disappearing, without the need for surgery.\nThis incredible story is an early example of a new clinical paradigm in biomedicine: 3D bioprinting.\nDiscover what 3D bioprinting can do now and in the future\nThis free online course tells the story of this revolution, introducing you to commonly used biomaterials, including metals, ceramics and polymers, and how bioprinting techniques, such as selective laser melting, hot-melt extrusion and inkjet printing, work. Through case studies - ranging from hip implants to facial transplants to lab-grown organs - we’ll answer questions such as:\n\nWhat is 3D printing and how did it come about?\nIs it really possible to print structures that incorporate both living and artificial components?\nHow long before we can print whole body organs for transplants?\nWhat is possible right now, and what will be possible in 20 and 50 years’ time?\nAnd what are the limitations of this technology?\n\nThis course will also equip and encourage you to become part of the story.

In the four weeks of this course we’ll investigate four forms of dementia that are important to understand better in their own right (they’re often not well recognised), but can also provide important insights that change how we think about dementia in general.\nWeek 1 – What if dementia runs in the family?\nExplore the challenges that face families - and ground-breaking research taking place - with people affected by familial Alzheimer’s disease, where the condition runs in the family and often starts at a young age.\nWeek 2 – What if dementia affects behaviour and personality?\nDementia is not just about memory loss – we investigate the particular challenges for diagnosis and care for people with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.\nWeek 3 – What if dementia makes you see things that aren’t there?\nSome people with dementia experience hallucinations, and many describe fluctuations in their symptoms over time. These aspects are particularly clear in dementia with Lewy bodies, which you’ll learn about in Week 3.\nWeek 4 – What if dementia affects your vision, not your memory? \nPeople with posterior cortical atrophy experience changes in the way the brain processes visual information; we’ll explore this condition and the research taking place to help people live better with visual impairment related to dementia.\n“The combination of personal stories paralleled by information given by expert clinicians and researchers was very engaging and, coupled with a multitude of interesting comments from course participants, provided a very well-rounded insight into the realities of dementia.” Anne Brink, learner in March 2016\nLearn from dementia experts, experts by experience and each other\nThis course is presented by experts from the UCL Institute of Neurology and Division of Psychiatry who are highly regarded for their work as scientists and clinicians. Importantly, you’ll hear from people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and people who care for a family member with dementia to get a better understanding of the impact that a diagnosis of dementia brings.\nYou’ll be able to understand how dementia affects people by watching video interviews, look deeper into the topics by reading articles, interact through activities and questions, and also learn from others on the course by taking part in the discussions that accompany each step.

You will become familiar with predictive analysis, dimension reduction, machine learning and clustering techniques. You will also discover how simple decision trees can help us make informed decisions and you can dive into statistical learning theory.\nExplore real-world big data problems\nThese methods will be described through case studies that explain how each is applied to solve real-world problems. You can also develop your coding skills by applying the techniques you’ve just learnt to complete hands-on tasks and obtain results.\nJust as there are many statistical and machine learning methods for big data analytics, there are also many software packages (see ‘Requirements’ below) that can be used for this purpose. In this course, we will expose you to three such packages, so that you can start to become familiar with using different tools, and can gain confidence in going further with these packages or using others that may come your way.\nContinue learning with the Big Data Analytics program\nThis course is one of four in the Big Data Analytics program on FutureLearn from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).\nThe program enables you to understand how big data is collected and managed, before exploring statistical inference, machine learning, mathematical modelling and data visualisation.\nWhen you complete all four courses and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will earn a FutureLearn Award as proof of completing the program of study.\nAcknowledgements\nQUT would like to thank the following content contributors:\n\nTomasz Bednarz\nAmy Cook\nMiles McBain\nKerrie Mengersen\nSam Rathmanner\nNan Ye\n\n", "end_date": "2016-09-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Big Data: Statistical Inference and Machine Learning", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Queensland University of Technology"], "commitment": "2 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/53/ec/regular_53ecec40-7f0b-46b5-81f5-c6f9353322c6.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/big-data-machine-learning?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"},

But familiarity with Western philosophy doesn’t always mean an accurate understanding of its Asian counterpart.\nSo what does the “Asian counterpart” of Western philosophy actually refer to? Confucianism? Daoism? Different schools of Buddhism like Theravada Buddhism or Mahayana Buddhism? And how do we understand each of them? This course will help you answer some of these questions.\nGet an easy introduction to East Asian philosophy\nAlthough English material on Asian perspectives can be easily found in the West, readers are often immediately frustrated by difficult terminology borrowed from classical Chinese/Sanskrit, along with the lack of explicit argument. So - is there any shortcut for accessing Asian philosophy without the burden of studying sinology or Indology? The answer is: yes. Contemporary Japanese philosophy offers such a shortcut.\nCompared with Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophical texts are more analytically organised, allowing for them to be more easily interpreted in terms of Anglophone philosophy.\nIn fact contemporary Japanese philosophers like Nishida Kitarō, Kuki Shuzō and Wastuji Tetsurō systematically introduced Western philosophical terminologies into their own theoretical work, so their works are more readable for a Western audience than classical Asian texts like The Book of Change.\nUnderstand Japanese philosophical problems\nThis course is designed to help a largely Western audience explore philosophical problems through a Japanese lens, without needing to know Japanese or any Japanese philosophers. Throughout the course you’ll will become acquainted with the Japanese way of doing philosophy and you’ll unpack Asian ways of thinking.\nMany of the philosophical problems addressed in this course are actually widely discussed in the Western tradition of philosophy, so a basic sense of what Western philosophy is can be useful as these are problems that are often re-introduced in the context of Japanese culture.\nIn addition, this course will also offer you a chance to re-evaluate your own philosophical assumptions by comparing them with their Japanese counterparts. Using these comparisons you’ll widen your own theoretical horizon when considering fundamental problems in philosophy.\nGet an insight into Asian Culture\nJapanese culture is, by its nature, a hybrid of nearly all Asian cultures outside Japan. \nThis means the study of Japanese culture in some ways offers a ‘package solution’ to the study of Asian culture in a more general sense.

You may remember how painful this experience was. Millions of children around the world are excluded from access to education because of a disability - their exclusion robs them of their potential and diminishes our society.\nUnderstand inclusive education and disability\nInclusive education is about addressing barriers to learning and participation and transforming school communities to allow them to really benefit from inclusion. Although inclusive education is about all forms of diversity, on this course you learn specifically about disability - as it is often an aspect of diversity that is neglected.\nFind out how to create an inclusive environment\nAccess to education for children with disabilities has been a challenge in many countries, with problems ranging from lack of resources, discriminatory policies, cultural and social prejudice, as well as the lack of practical support for educators and parents.\nThis course aims to help teachers, other professionals and parents to tackle inclusion, in a practical way, in their own environment. Over six weeks, we will look at the background of disability and strategies for creating an enabling environment in the school and community.\nYou will learn in a variety of ways, from short video lectures, readings and discussions, to online quizzes. Each will introduce different perspectives in the inclusive education framework and help you to apply inclusive education in your own context.\nLearn from people with experience of disability\nFrom challenging perceptions of disability to everyday classroom practices, this course will offer you insights from a range of people who have worked with disabled children - parents, teachers, facilitators, occupational and allied therapists and school principals.\nYou will also learn from established educators. Dr Judith McKenzie is a lecturer and researcher at the University of Cape Town who has taught and published extensively on disability and inclusive education; she has worked in rural areas focusing on community based and interdisciplinary efforts to address disability, exclusion and poverty.\nChioma Ohajunwa has a B.Ed in Special Education and Language Arts and an MPhil in Disability Studies and has worked in various contexts ranging from educare for disabled children in Nigeria and Liberia, to disabilities studies in South African higher education.\nIn the words of American educator, Dr Kevin Maxwell, “Our job is to teach the kids we have. Not the ones we would like to have. Not the ones we used to have.

{"selfpaced": false, "instructors": "Adriaan Wierenga", "description": "Het recht regelt vrijwel alle aspecten van de maatschappij. Soms is dat heel zichtbaar: je komt het tegen in de rechtszaal bij een zaak tegen een grote crimineel of in de Tweede Kamer bij een verhit debat over een nieuw wetsvoorstel. Het recht regelt ook kleinere - maar belangrijke - dingen, zoals het huurcontract van je nieuwe woning of je arbeidsovereenkomst.\nHet recht is daarnaast voor een groot deel ‘onzichtbaar’. Als je bijvoorbeeld de dagelijkse boodschappen afrekent bij de kassa, ben je jezelf er wellicht niet direct van bewust dat er steeds een wederkerige verbintenisscheppende overeenkomst tot stand komt tussen jou en de supermarkt. Daaruit vloeien veel meer rechten en plichten voort dan alleen het leveren van de boodschappen en het betalen daarvoor.\nJuist omdat het recht zo veel invloed heeft op het leven van alledag, komt enige juridische kennis steeds van pas.\n\nBen je in het recht geïnteresseerd, bijvoorbeeld omdat je daarmee in je werk- of privéomgeving regelmatig in aanraking komt?\nBen je op zoek naar de juiste studie, of wil je binnen je eigen studie je horizon verbreden?\n\nDan is deze introducerende cursus interessant voor jou!\nWat je tijdens deze cursus gaat doen\nDoor middel van video’s, artikelen, oefenvragen en discussies maak je de komende vijf weken jouw eerste stappen in de wereld van het recht.\nDe eerste week legt de basis waarop we de rest van de weken voortbouwen. Wat is recht? Waar kun je het vinden? Hoe kun je het vinden? Je gaat zelf wetten en rechterlijke uitspraken opzoeken, lezen en gebruiken om je argumenten bij een juridische zaak goed te onderbouwen. Deze vaardigheden komen niet alleen gedurende deze cursus van pas, maar ook al direct in het dagelijks leven!\nDe tweede week gaat over een heel zichtbaar deel van het recht: het staatsrecht. Wie maakt de regels? Hoe verhoudt de Tweede Kamer zich tot de regering? Je gaat op ontdekkingsreis in de Grondwet en leert wat de uitwerking is van grondrechten. Is het ene grondrecht belangrijker dan het andere? Betekent de vrijheid van meningsuiting dat je alles mag zeggen? En zijn er mensen die méér mogen zeggen dan anderen?\nIn de derde week leer je meer over schade en aansprakelijkheid. Waarom kun je beter niet zomaar een kelderluik in een café open laten staan? En waarom moet je soms toch iemands schade vergoeden terwijl het niet jouw schuld was? En – ook belangrijk – wanneer hoeft dat niet?\nIn de vierde week leer je wanneer en hoe je jezelf kunt verweren tegen de machtige overheid. Hoe ziet ‘het bestuur’ van ons land er precies uit? En wat kun je doen als je van de burgemeester geen project X-feestje mag houden? Of als je geen bouwvergunning voor een nieuwe dakkapel krijgt?\nDe vijfde week gaat over een onderdeel van het recht waar je waarschijnlijk meteen aan denkt bij het woord ‘recht’: het strafrecht. Er komen vragen aan de orde als: wanneer bega je een strafbaar feit? Kun je de staf ontlopen door een ‘vormfout’? Wanneer en hoe intensief mag je jezelf of een ander verdedigen tegen een aanval?\nWat je na deze cursus kunt\nNa afloop van de cursus ben je in staat om:\n\nuit te leggen wat ‘recht’ is aan de hand van de functies, de bronnen en de indeling van het recht;\nverschillende rechtsgebieden van elkaar te onderscheiden;\nenkele juridische basisbegrippen te herkennen en te beschrijven;\nwetgeving en uitspraken van rechters op te zoeken en op elementair niveau te analyseren;\nbasale juridische problemen op te lossen en de oplossing te motiveren aan de hand van wetsartikelen en rechterlijke uitspraken.\n\nSchrijf je nu in en doe mee!\n", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Inleiding Nederlands recht: de eerste stappen in de wereld van het recht", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["University of Groningen"], "commitment": "3 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/64/c1/regular_64c165ba-36e6-4b1a-b524-8ce9b64328c9.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/nederlands-recht?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z"},

Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a ‘boiling point.’ Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States’  “rebalance” toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics.\nExplore regional cooperation and economy\nFrom a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China’s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor — the United States.\nContemplate the future of South Korea\nSouth Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea’s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific. At the same time, the evolving regional order and thus the 21st century global politics would be affected by how South Korea, as one of the key actors of East Asia, behaves toward other regional states.\nIn this respect, we aim to understand South Korea within the context of complex and important dynamics concerning global politics and the international relations of Asia-Pacific.\nYou will learn with Yong-Soo EUN, Professor of of Political Science and International Studies at Hanyang University, and the Editor-in-Chief Routledge Series, IR Theory and Practice in Asia (https://www.routledge.com/series/IRTPA).\nYou can find out more about this course and related issues in Yong-Soo’s homepage:  https://hanyang.academia.edu/YongSooEun \n", "end_date": "2016-08-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Korea in a Global Context", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["Hanyang University"], "commitment": "3 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/37/aa/regular_37aada23-484e-4786-b364-5f4e99ff79e6.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/korea-global-context?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z"},

Understanding who is important to an organisation – and that’s everybody who has a stake in it in some way – is a really good starting point. Building relationships with interested groups and people is time well spent. So too is time spent on planning. As someone once said ‘To fail to plan is to plan to fail’. If there’s no plan, how do organisations get people on board? If there’s no plan, what’s the difference between success and failure?  How do you know when things are going off track? Or going well?\nPlans are one thing. The people who can make the plans a reality are those with the right knowledge, skills and experience. Without the right person, performing as well as they can in the right job, plans don’t get off the ground. So building, supporting, growing and developing a team is much of what leading and managing is all about.   And sometimes that’s about tackling poor performance, which can be uncomfortable.\nDevelop a business plan and build an effective team\nThis four-week course will guide you through the some key aspects of leadership and management. You will:\n\nFind out about stakeholders – the people and groups who have an interest in an organisation – and how to analyse them, communicate with them and build effective relationships with them.\nExamine what is involved in making plans and implementing them at different levels in organisations.\nExplore what makes for best practice in recruiting and selecting the right people for a team.\nLook at how good induction can help to settle a new employee in so that they can perform well and enjoy their new role.\nFind out how understanding what motivates people at work and managing performance can support individuals, teams and organisations as a whole.\n\nAt the end of the course you will have gained an insight into leadership and management and how you can develop the skills and knowledge to make you more effective in leading and managing in your organisation.\nLearn with The Open University Business School and CMI\nThe course has been developed by The Open University Business School – a pioneering institution that is triple accredited by AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB – and the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) – the leading authority on management and leadership in the UK.\nAs such, it will give you the opportunity to learn from both academic experts and experienced practitioners, who have achieved the CMI’s prestigious Chartered Manager status.\nTake your first step to becoming a Chartered Manager\nThe course is one of two in the Management and Leadership program on FutureLearn.

We then move on to explore your attitude to financial management and whether you have bad financial habits and how these should be addressed.\nWe introduce a simple four-stage model for making financial decisions before moving on to examine the two components of household budgeting – income and expenditure. In doing this we learn about the impact of inflation and taxation on incomes and the support to households provided by the state benefit system.\nIn examining expenditure we look at the pressures placed on us to spend our money, how to shop with confidence on the internet and on how ‘heuristics’ can interfere with good spending decision-making.\nThe course finishes by looking at a key area of household spending: insurance. We examine when to insure and when to bear the risks yourself without buying an insurance policy. We use the financial planning model, introduced at the start of the course, to make good decisions when buying insurance.\nThis facilitated 4-week course is up-to-date and uses an array of audio-visual assets to help you through the subject matter.\nDevelop fundamental business and finance skills\nThis course has been developed by The Open University Business School – a pioneering institution that is triple accredited by AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB.\nIt is one of eight from The Open University, designed to help you gain fundamental business and financial skills, including communication, networking, relationship building, project management, personal financial planning and management, investment and financial services.\nYou can complete this course as part of one of these two programs:\nFinance Fundamentals: four courses, which will give you valuable skills to manage finances at home and at work, and enable you to earn a FutureLearn Award.\nBusiness and Finance Fundamentals: eight courses; holders of FutureLearn Certificates of Achievement for all eight courses can earn 30 UK credits towards The Open University Business School’s BA in Business Management by passing a linked Open University assessment module (requiring separate OU registration and fee).\nFor further information about registration, the final assessment course and the BA in Business Management, visit the Open University website.\nThe True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance (True Potential PUFin)\nThis course has been adapted from original material created by The Open University’s True Potential Centre for the Public Understanding of Finance, and was made possible thanks to the generous support of True Potential LLP.\n", "end_date": "2016-09-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "Finance Fundamentals: Financial Planning and Budgeting", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/17/41/regular_1741b37a-d1a3-4c14-bd41-c62861214bef.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/personal-financial-planning-and-budgeting?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-08-15T00:00:00Z"},

On this course, you will consider some of the key issues related to the ethical dimensions implied by climate change – learning especially from the problems faced as well as the resilience models formulated by the marginalized sectors of society or the so-called “Global South”.\nUnderstand the environmental problems and proposed solutions by the Global South\nAlthough the populations of the Global South have least contributed to the greenhouse gas emissions that have exacerbated the negative effects of climate change, they are also the ones who are most vulnerable to extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods, typhoons, sea-level rise and desertification. Needless to say, these phenomena have profound social implications that may harm future generations.\nThis situation raises some major ethical questions:\n\nTo what extent are human beings entitled to exploit nature for their needs and interests?\nWho is to be held responsible, or what kind of shared responsibility is appropriate in addressing climate change?\n\nThe effects of climate change disasters, however, are not only confined to the global south but are also felt by the more affluent sectors of societies or the Global North.\nIn order to achieve a more sustainable world where nature can continue to support the aspirations for better living conditions for future and disadvantaged generations, a notion of justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature and the human beings’ rights to live and enjoy the fruits of their labor must be formulated.\nLearn about climate justice\nFollowing the recommendation of UNESCO’s World Commission for the Ethics of Science and Technology (COMEST) in the promotion of Biological and Cultural Diversity as starting point of Climate Change Ethics, UNESCO is currently pioneering a worldwide reflection on the ‘ethical principles in relation to climate change’. Along the same line, within its philosophy programme, in 2014 UNESCO published the “Manual of Philosophy – A South-South Perspective”. This Manual sheds a new light on the singularity of some major philosophical texts and traditions from the Global South.\nThis course has been built upon these two major undertakings. It will propose a notion of climate justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature, on the one hand, while supporting the biological and economic needs of human populations, on the other hand.  Human needs and ecological integrity, therefore, need not be opposing but more supportive of one another in so far as human beings allow nature to regenerate herself by regulating their excessive consumption of natural resources.\nThe course proposes groundbreaking reflections on Climate Justice, from the philosophical and ethical points of view, while exploring the Global South’s approaches.\nExplore how humans can balance their needs with the needs of the planet\nAt the end of the course, you’ll learn about the various practices of frugality in the global south and enable you to adapt these practices to your own circumstances in view of contributing to the needs of the most vulnerable populations of society.\nYou will also be able to imagine different ways of extracting natural resources without compromising the regenerating capacity of nature to sustain itself and thus continuously support the needs of all human beings.\n", "end_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "Climate Justice: Lessons from the Global South", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["UNESCO"], "commitment": "2 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/96/8b/regular_968baec3-1b9f-465a-9fda-3c67f6042c0d.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-justice?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z"},

You will learn how European culture is imagined and constructed by European institutions via the EU’s language policy or the Capital of Culture programme, but also how these top-down interventions into the meaning of Europe are challenged by local/grass-root cultural practices and interventions.\nIn the second week, you will look at the role religion plays in European politics and societies.

And you will see how religion has been used to identify what is Europe and what is not Europe\nThe third week considers Europe’s relationship with modernity. Europe is often held as a standard: it is where modern science developed, where modern political systems came into being and where modern literary genres were invented. You will look at the assumptions behind and implications of this idea of modernity.\nIn the fourth week, we turn to the nation-state. Although the EU is often said to be the anti-thesis of the nation-state, some have argued that it has actually saved it. You will examine the EU as an unique experiment in the creation of a post-national political entity. You will also be asked to rethink the existing forms of political organisation in Europe and propose sustainable solutions for problems linked to integration beyond the nation state.\nThe fifth week examines how Europe is constructed as a democratic space. You will see how European political integration has been furthered and legitimised through a particular reading of democracy. Focus is placed on challenges and possible solutions to the construction of democracy in a post-national society.\nIn the sixth week you will examine how European identity is constructed via practices of othering; claims of what Europe is not. By addressing the question of Europe’s other we will not only gain a better perspective on how Europe is imagined but also whose voices remain silent/marginalised in this process. If we want to build a more inclusive Europe – and we do – critical questions of who is Europe’s other and how is Europe imagined by this other – need to be addressed.\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n\ndescribe how European political integration is embedded in broader cultural modalities such as language or memory;\nexplain Europe as a multifaceted and ever-changing entity;\ndefine the main transdisciplinary debates on Europe and European identity;\nunderstand deeper and more underlying roots of contemporary problems of Europe integration;\npropose innovative sustainable solutions to these problems;\ndebate sensitive topics in a culturally and academically diverse environment. \n\n", "end_date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "European Culture and Politics", "price": 0, "topic_name": null, "institution_name": ["University of Groningen"], "commitment": "5 hours/week", "cover_url": "https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/7f/6c/regular_7f6cbd08-46c5-447f-8069-4286928bd5ec.jpg", "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/european-culture?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "currency": null, "subject_name": null, "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-26T00:00:00Z"},

But data by itself is mute—it can only help us if we learn to make it speak and tell its story.\nIn this short free online course, we will introduce basic ideas about collecting data, and techniques for turning data into information we can use. Along the way, we will hear from researchers at Loughborough University about the ways they use data in their work.\nLearn to answer questions with data\nIn the first week, we will start by considering some questions drawn from arts, political science, geography and sport that we want to answer.  We will think about what sort of data we might be able to use to answer these questions, and how we might go about finding this data.\nOnce we have data, we will start to explore it using some visual tools we can either create by hand or using apps online.
