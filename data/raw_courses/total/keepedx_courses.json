    "description": "Exploration of foundational elements for different contexts of online learning, investigate educational trends in the modern classroom, and discuss emerging opportunities in the evolving learning ecosystem through online and face-to-face interactions.\n\nAbout This Course\nThis on-demand course will lead you through design considerations and implementation skills for e-learning at three different scales. We start by equipping you with the building blocks for creating your own videos, and exploring how to blend these into your on-campus teaching. Then we’ll shift from micro- to macro-level online learning. By immersing in the world of MOOCs, you’ll grapple with the nuances of teaching an international audience fully online. In the last part of the course, you will experience the power of educational data and the utilities of learning analytics for improving learning experience. Once you’ve taken this course, you’ll approach online teaching with a broadened lens, and come away with the skills required to kick-start your e-learning journey. \n\n\nCourse Staff\n\n\n\n\nHKU Technology-Enriched Learning Initiative (TELI)\nWe are TELI, a team of e-learning technologists, instructional designers, multimedia professionals, researchers and collaboration coordinators under Teaching and Learning of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). Our mission is to showcase, facilitate and improve technology-enriched teaching and learning (e-learning) across HKU. We hope to use technology as a tool to build genuine partnership with stakeholders in teaching and (e-)learning.\nIf you&rsquo;d like to get updates on HKU&rsquo;s e-learning seminars, workshops and other activities, please sign up our mailing list, visit our e-learning blog or subscribe our Facebook page.\n\n",

    "description": "Hong Kong is very famous for its superb cuisine, which is a fantastic fusion of eastern and western styles. Cooking is both an art and a science. Good tasting foods and drinks are the results of perfect matches of ingredients and cooking methods. Foods and drinks are closely related to chemistry. Having some understanding about the chemistry of the food ingredients and the various cooking methods can help appreciating the connections between science and human life. This course will discuss the Hong Kong cuisine culture from the chemistry perspective, to explain why these famous foods and drinks are so tasty and popular. Examples include Chinese rotisserie (Siu Mei), wonton noodles, steamed seafoods, stewed beef brisket, silk stocking milk tea, and century egg with pickled ginger, etc. Consuming food and soups that carry health and therapeutic values is also a unique food culture in China and Southeast Asia. The course will introduce several typ es of food that are traditionally considered to have some specific functions, and discuss their scientific justifications from the chemistry point of views. Besides, pre-packaged food and fast food is an important eating culture of modern urban people. Some important issues about packaged food and fast food, such as food storage and packaging, uses of approved (and prohibited) food additives, alternative ingredients, and food testing, will also be discussed.\n\nAbout This Course\nHong Kong is very famous for its superb cuisine, which is a fantastic fusion of eastern and western styles.
