The molecular basis of alternative reproductive cycles are presented with examples drawn from a set of representative animal and human viruses, although selected bacterial viruses will be discussed.This offering has been a top-ten iTunes U Course in sciences pretty much since its release in 2012, with over 80,000 subscriptions. The course will be ported to the Coursera platform in two parts and will allow interested online students to take the course as a cohort for the first time.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1Welcome to virologyWhat is a virus?Viruses then and nowWeek 2The infectious cycleAssay of viral infectivityMeasurement\n    of virions and their componentsRevolutionary methodsOne-step growth\n    cycle\nWeek 3The Baltimore schemeDNA virus genomesRNA virus genomesViral\n    genetics\nWeek 4StructureThe tools of structural virologyHelical symmetryIcosahedral symmetryEnveloped virionsComplex virions\nWeek 5Attachment to cellsEntry into cellsAcid-catalyzed fusionA new paradigm for entryEntry of non-enveloped virionsEntering the nucleus\nWeek 6Viral RNA synthesisRNA polymerizationPlus strand RNA synthesisNegative strand RNA synthesisRNA synthesis of dsRNA genomesRNA synthesis as a source of diversity\nWeek 7DNA basicsLessons from SV40Priming via DNA or proteinViral originsBig DNA virusesRegulation of DNA synthesis\nWeek 8TranscriptionInitiation of transcriptionViral transcription regulationCapping and polyadenylationPre-mRNA splicing\nWeek 9Reverse transcriptaseRetrovirusesReverse transcriptionIntegrationThe provirusHepatitis B virus\nWeek 10End-dependent initiation of protein synthesisOther decoding mechanismsOne mRNA, one protein?Maximizing coding capacity of the viral genomeRegulation of translation: eIF2alphaHow viruses regulate cell translationMicroRNAs\nWeek 11Principles of virion assemblyGetting to the right placeMaking sub-assembliesConcerted assembly: BuddingGenome packagingAcquisition of an envelope and egress\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-10-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "Virology I: How Viruses Work", "price": 0, "instructors": "Vincent Racaniello", "institution_name": ["Columbia University"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/virology", "duration": "11 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
