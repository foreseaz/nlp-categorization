The challenge of identifying effective ways to help people experiencing addiction is a serious one, and much depends on the quality of the clinical decisions we make. This course is intended to help you meet this challenge\u00a0by increasing your understanding of the biology of addiction and the available treatment options in the different stages of the recovery journey.\n\nKey questions we will look at in this course include:\n\nWhy is it so difficult to change addictive behaviour?\n\tWhat kinds of treatment can help a person experiencing addiction?\n\tWhat is my role as a professional, either within or outside of addiction care?\n\tHow can I identify the best of the many options available?\n\tWhat evidence do I need to be able to make a sound decision about treatment?\n\tWhat approaches to addiction are proven to work\u00a0around the world?\n\tWhat is the potential impact of my decisions on the life of a person experiencing addiction?\nThis course explores the \u201cRecovery Pathway,\u201d\u00a0an easy-to-use framework\u00a0for helping people with addiction move successfully from addiction to recovery. It will help you to plan a pathway through screening and assessment, to withdrawal and long-term relapse prevention. It will examine a range of psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted treatments. At each step of the pathway, you will review the biological basis of behaviour and treatment as well as evidence-based and service delivery considerations. It is an ideal starting-point for healthcare professionals who want to get to grips with potentially effective approaches to treating addiction,\u00a0and need tools to make critical decisions.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-11-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "AddictionX: Managing Addiction: A Framework for Successful Treatment", "price": 0, "instructors": "Abdallah Salem, Robert Ali, Linda Gowing and Dr Femke Buisman-Pijlma", "institution_name": ["University of Adelaide"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/managing-addiction-framework-successful-adelaidex-addictionx", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
