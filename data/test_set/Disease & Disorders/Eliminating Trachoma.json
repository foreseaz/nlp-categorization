It occurs in some of the poorest populations with limited access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, and is the world\u2019s leading infectious cause of blindness. At present, we have a unique opportunity to eliminate this disease.\n\nThis course aims to inform and support the personnel implementing and managing trachoma programmes at a district and community level. Additionally, the course will provide insights from stakeholders, experts and professionals as they share successes and resolve challenges to achieve elimination of trachoma.\n\nUnderstand trachoma as a disease\nThis course will teach you to evaluate the natural history, clinical signs, and grading of trachoma in individuals, and map the burden of disease at a community level.\n\nExplore the epidemiology of trachoma\nWe will investigate and provide guidance on how epidemiological data informs the selection of interventions at local and national level, and how it informs decision making on the path to eradicating the disease.\n\nDiscover how trachoma elimination strategies are implemented\nAppropriate interventions to eliminate trachoma are encapsulated by the acronym \u2018SAFE\u2019, which represents surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvement. We will consider what it takes to deliver the SAFE strategy in trachoma-endemic regions with agreed best practices, and how to best monitor and evaluate these activities for improved effectiveness.\n\nThroughout the course we will use a variety of learning tools and provide opportunities to interact and learn through online conversations with peers and educators from across the world. A wide range of experts will be taking part, including:\n\n\n  Staff from the World Health Organization\n  Academics from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine\n  Stakeholders from NGOs\n  Experts from water, sanitation and hygiene, and\n  People active at the community level.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "Eliminating Trachoma", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr Daksha Patel and Allen Foster", "institution_name": ["London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/eliminating-trachoma?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
