Mindfulness might be the solution.\n\nMindfulness is essentially about being more aware and awake in every moment of your life. It is about intentionally paying attention to each moment, being fully engaged in whatever is happening around and within you, with an attitude of friendliness and compassion.\n\nResearch shows that when we are not deliberately paying attention to something, our brain clicks off into default mode, which is characterised by mind wandering, operating on \u201cautopilot,\u201d dwelling on the past, and worrying about  judgment, criticism and the future.\n\nThe result can be increased stress and anxiety, poor communication, and impaired academic and occupational functioning.\n\nLearn mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and improve performance\n\nMindfulness can help you unhook from these unproductive thought patterns and behaviours, and engage more fully with work and leisure time.\n\nThis practical six-week course explores the science, practice and philosophy of mindfulness. You will learn how to incorporate mindfulness practices into your life to reduce stress, improve mental health, and enhance your personal and professional life.\n\nYou will understand formal mindfulness meditation practices, as well as the informal practice of being mindful in daily life to learn - to pay attention to the present moment instead of worrying, dwelling in the past or reacting to what is happening.\n\nYou will also develop an attitude of friendliness and compassion toward yourself, as opposed to self-criticism.\n\nThese mindfulness-based approaches have been found to improve executive functioning, learning and memory, performance, communication, empathy, and mental and physical health.\n\nLearn from experienced mindfulness practitioners\n\nAssociate Professor Craig Hassed is a General Practitioner and Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, and the Mindfulness Coordinator at Monash University.
