Currently, it\u2019s a problem without a solution - \ndieting is difficult, drug therapies are poor, and surgical solutions are \nonly offered to those suffering serious ill-health. In addition, there \nare many common misconceptions about appetite, diet and exercise, and about the\n best ways to treat or prevent obesity.\n\nThis course is taught by partners in the EU-funded research project Nudge-it.\n This project brings together dozens of experts in neurobiology, psychology and\u00a0behavioural economics from universities in the UK, Germany, \nthe Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, the US and New Zealand. \nThe project's overall aim is to better understand decision-making in food choice \nand to contribute to improving public health policy.\n\nIn this course we discuss the facts and misconceptions around \nobesity, and the gaps in the scientific knowledge. We discuss key \nphysiological and psychological concepts around the brain\u2019s control of \nappetite and body weight, and reflect on the power of these systems - \nhow they make weight gain easy and weight loss hard. We describe \nnew approaches to the treatment and prevention of obesity, and give you \nthe opportunity to reflect on your own knowledge and assumptions around \nthe causes of obesity.If you\u2019re on Twitter, tell us why you are taking\nthe course \u2013 use the hashtag #nudgeitmoocVisit the project website at\u00a0www.nudge-it.euWe're on Twitter:\u00a0@nudgeit_\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\u00a0Evidence. The\u00a0major aim of this course is to explore the evidence base for obesity science -\u00a0what\nwe know and what we don\u2019t know. We'll highlight how the\u00a0evidence sometimes\u00a0contradicts\u00a0commonly-held beliefs.\u00a0\n\nWeek 2: Physiology.\nExploring the neurobiological and hormonal control of appetite. How the environment interacts with our physiology to influence food choice. \n\nWeek 3:\u00a0Psychology.\nThe psychological\ncontrol of appetite. How cognition influences food choice. \n\nWeek 4: Stress. How\u00a0early-life experience\u00a0influences food choice in later life. Stress and emotional eating.\n\nWeek 5:\u00a0Economics. How behavioural economics may deliver new ways of changing choice\nbehaviour. Food insecurity and health inequities.\n\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Nudge-it: Understanding obesity", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Menzies and ", "institution_name": ["University of Edinburgh"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/nudgeit", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
