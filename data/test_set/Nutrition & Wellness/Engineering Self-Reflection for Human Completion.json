It is difficult to do\nbecause you spend your busy life every day with so much to do. Therefore, you\nare always looking forward, looking ahead. It is not easy to stop and take time\nto reflect on yourself. Research shows that if you reflect on yourself through\nmeditation or writing a diary, you can work more efficiently and become a\nsuccessful leader.In\nthis lecture, I will introduce a practical methodology of self-reflection\nmeditation.\u00a0 It is also a sustainable methodology you can\npractice in ordinary life. You will check your path in life, and you can\nunderstand yourself better in social relationships. You can concentrate on the\npurpose of your life through self-reflection. Examples from nature and air vehicles are\nalso used as corollaries to demonstrate how to live a fulfilling life.\n\n\n\nAfter reflecting on yourself according to this\nmethodology, you will know clearly your character, your pattern of response,\npast trauma and your current problems.\u00a0\nIf you eliminate the negative mind of the causes of the problem, your\ninner positive strength will be revealed. And more, you will also learn the\nmethodology to live a free and complete life. It is highly recommended for students with\nengineering and science backgrounds to enroll in such a\nhumanities course to achieve a balanced education and life.Human completion is to exceed your boundaries and live with your neighbors in the world in happiness and harmony. This is a totally new methodology.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Necessity of self-reflectionSelf- reflection is the methodology of meditation for growth, happiness and human completion- \u00a0 Why do we need self-reflection?- \u00a0 Academic research on self-reflection- \u00a0 Draw my life graph- \u00a0 Ultimate purpose of self-reflection\u00a0Week 2: Principle and practice of self-reflectionLearn the principle of self-reflection and practice the self\u2013reflection through 5 subjects- \u00a0 Methodology of self-reflection- \u00a0 Practice of self-reflection through 5 essential subjects (barrier in relationships, inferiority and ego in childhood, emotion of love and hatred since childhood, worries, response to problems )- \u00a0 My past life and my current selfWeek 3: Copied world and real worldRecognize the copied world and real world and think of living free from the self.- \u00a0 \u00a0Principle of mind formation- \u00a0 \u00a0Human recognition observed by philosophers and neuroscientists- \u00a0 \u00a0Understanding the reasons why we cannot live with free will- \u00a0 \u00a0Human mind and Original mind\u00a0Week 4: Methodology of mind subtraction changes myselfLearn and practice the methodology of mind subtraction- \u00a0 \u00a0Do you want to change yourself?- \u00a0 \u00a0Methodology of mind subtraction- \u00a0 \u00a0Repetition of the self-reflection of 5 essential subjects- \u00a0 \u00a0Real potential and positive mind\u00a0Week 5: Self-reflection and mind subtraction in ordinary life.Learn and practice the methodology of self-reflection and subtraction the mind in everyday life.- \u00a0 \u00a0Stress is the impetus for growth- \u00a0 \u00a0Case study on overcoming the self- \u00a0 \u00a0Health-mind relationship and brain wave changes- \u00a0 \u00a0Meaning of self-reflection and mind subtraction in life.\u00a0Week 6: Starting point of new life, life with wisdom and peaceful worldLet\u2019s start the peaceful life with wisdom- \u00a0 \u00a0Draw your life graph again- \u00a0 \u00a0People at school and the office practicing self-reflection continuously- \u00a0 \u00a0Meaning of self-reflection in social aspects (through reflections on communication and relationships)- \u00a0 \u00a0Starting point of peaceful life with wisdom\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Engineering Self-Reflection for Human Completion", "price": 0, "instructors": "Duck-Joo Lee", "institution_name": ["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/selfreflection", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
