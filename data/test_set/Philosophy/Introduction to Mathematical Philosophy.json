Let's calculate.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One: Infinity (Zeno's Paradox, Galileo's Paradox, very basic set theory, infinite sets).Week Two: Truth (Tarski's theory of truth, recursive definitions, complete induction over sentences, Liar Paradox).Week Three: Rational Belief (propositions as sets of possible worlds, rational all-or-nothing belief, rational degrees of belief, bets, Lottery Paradox).Week Four: If-then (indicative vs subjunctive conditionals, conditionals in mathematics, conditional rational degrees of belief, beliefs in conditionals vs conditional beliefs).Week Five: Confirmation (the underdetermination thesis, the Monty Hall Problem, Bayesian confirmation theory).Week Six: Decision (decision making under risk,\u00a0maximizing\u00a0xpected utility, von Neumann Morgenstern axioms and representation theorem, Allais Paradox, Ellsberg Paradox).Week Seven: Voting (Condorcet Paradox, Arrows Theorem, Condorcet Jury Theorem, Judgment Aggregation).Week Eight: Quantum Logic and Probability (statistical correlations, the CHSH inequality, Boolean and non-Boolean algebras, violation of distributivity)\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-22T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Hannes Leitgeb and Stephan Hartmann", "institution_name": ["Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/mathphil", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
