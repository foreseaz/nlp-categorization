Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nTill recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? (and about which you can find out more at http://deepredink.com/demos/happysmarts/books.php) can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nThe course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:\n      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),\n      - Ed Diener (\u201cDr. Happiness\u201d),\n      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),\n\nBy taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:\n      - Why aren\u2019t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could\u2014or should\u2014be\n      - What are the \u201c7 Deadly Happiness Sins\u201d that even the smart and the successful commit?, and\n      - What are the \u201c7 Habits of the Highly Happy\u201d and how can you implement them in your life?\n\nBy the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Course intro and happiness measurementModule 2: The 1st sin, habit, and exerciseModule 3: The 2nd sin, habit, and exerciseModule 4: The 3rd sin, habit and exerciseModule 5: The 4th sin, habit and exerciseModule 6: The 5th sin, habit and exerciseModule 7: The 6th sin, habit, and exerciseModule 8: The 7th sin, habit, and exerciseModule 9: Summary and concluding Remarks\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment", "price": 0, "instructors": "Rajagopal Raghunathan", "institution_name": ["Indian School of Business"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
