In The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip, we will illuminate what we take for granted in perception, action, and interaction with others. We\u2019ll explore this mindful awareness through demonstrations, illusions, brainteasers, thought experiments, riddles and jokes, all designed to shake you loose from your ordinary assumptions about the way consciousness works.\u00a0\n\nYou will explore your own mind and the minds of others in a new way, using a philosophical approach known as phenomenology.\u00a0You\u2019ll encounter some of the main ideas of the phenomenological tradition, through short readings by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Their ideas are provocative and will animate the online and offline conversation as we proceed. But the main approach of the course will be experiential and experimental. You\u2019ll learn phenomenology by doing it and journeying among the structures and elements of your own conscious experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "T004x: The Conscious Mind - A Philosophical Road Trip", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dan Lloyd", "institution_name": ["Trinity College"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/conscious-mind-philosophical-road-trip-trinityx-t004x", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
