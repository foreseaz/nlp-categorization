But what are the Jewish scriptures? When were they written? And why are they relevant in the 21st century?\n\nThis religion course introduces students to the diversity of the ever-expanding Jewish canon and the equally diverse ways of reading it. It will examine how Jews, ancient and modern, drew inspiration and guidance from the traditional texts while simultaneously reinterpreting their contents in light of new circumstances. The religion we call \u201cJudaism\u201d emerges at the nexus of text, interpretation, and lived tradition.\n\nWhether you are a long-time student of the Jewish scriptures or a complete newcomer, this course will give you a new understanding of the fascinating roles that sacred texts have played in the rich history of Judaism.\n\nThis course is part of the World Religions Through Their Scriptures XSeries Program.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-02-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "HDS3221.6x: Judaism Through Its Scriptures", "price": 0, "instructors": "Shaye Cohen and Matthew Hass", "institution_name": ["Harvard University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/judaism-through-its-scriptures-harvardx-hds3221-6x", "duration": "27 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
