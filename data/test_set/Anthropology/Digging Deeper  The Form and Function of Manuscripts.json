The\u00a0Digging Deeper\u00a0team of scholars from Stanford and Cambridge shows how to analyze the function of manuscripts, the methods by which they are conserved, and the digital means that are transforming the field of manuscript studies. We will look at the development of music, move beyond the European tradition to study non-Western manuscripts, and see how digital methods are allowing for new inquiry and posing new problems. In pursuing these studies, you will study some of the most significant and beautiful books held by the university libraries of Cambridge and Stanford.\r\nDigging Deeper\u00a0is a five-week course, with each week featuring filmed sequences of experts with manuscripts, reading assignments, a short transcription, and self-test quizzes. Assignments will help you further your knowledge of how to access manuscripts in person and online, skills in codicology (the study of the medieval book and the physical make-up of manuscripts), palaeography (the describing and analysis of medieval scripts), and transcription (the reading and interpretation of writing in manuscripts). Participants who finish the course will earn a Stanford Statement of Accomplishment.\r\nDigging Deeper: The Form and Function of Manuscripts\u00a0builds upon the Winter 2015 course\u00a0Digging Deeper: Making Manscripts, but that class is not a prerequisite to this course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "Digging Deeper: The Form and Function of Manuscripts", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. Orietta Da Rold, Dr. Suzanne Paul, Dr. Benjamin Albritton and Elaine Treharne", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://class.stanford.edu/courses/English/diggingdeeper2/Spring2015/about", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Stanford OpenEdx"], "start_date": "2015-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
