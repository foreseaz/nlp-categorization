The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire\u2019s provinces, Hadrian\u2019s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.\n\nThis six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian\u2019s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers\u2019 families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.\n\nDrawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:\n\n\n  the factors that determine the survival of evidence\n  the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation\n  the planning of archaeological projects\n  excavation techniques\n  and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.\n\n\nAs part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome\u2019s most famous frontier.\n\nFind out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the FutureLearn blog.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Hadrian's Wall: Life on the Roman Frontier", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ian Haynes", "institution_name": ["Newcastle University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hadrians-wall?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
