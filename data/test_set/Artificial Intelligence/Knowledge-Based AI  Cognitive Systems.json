Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.\n\nThis is a core course in artificial intelligence. It is designed to be a challenging course, involving significant independent work, readings, assignments, and projects. It covers structured knowledge representations, as well as knowledge-based methods of problem solving, planning, decision-making, and learning.\n\nThe class is organized around three primary learning goals. First, this class teaches the concepts, methods, and prominent issues in knowledge-based artificial intelligence. Second, it teaches the specific skills and abilities needed to apply those concepts to the design of knowledge-based AI agents. Third, it teaches the relationship between knowledge-based artificial intelligence and the study of human cognition.Why Take This Course?At the conclusion of this class, you will be able to accomplish three primary tasks. First, you will be able to design and implement a knowledge-based artificial intelligence agent that can address a complex task using the methods discussed in the course. Second, you will be able to use this agent to reflect on the process of human cognition. Third, you will be able to use both these practices to address practical problems in multiple domains.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Unit 1: Introduction to KBAI and Cognitive Systems.\n- Where Knowledge-Based AI fits into AI as a whole\n- Cognitive systems: what are they?\n- AI and cognition: how are they connected?\n\n### Unit 2: Fundamentals\n- Semantic Networks\n- Generate &amp; Test\n- Means-Ends Analysis\n- Problem Reduction\n- Production Systems\n\n### Unit 3: Common Sense Reasoning\n- Frames\n- Understanding\n- Common Sense Reasoning\n- Scripts\n\n### Unit 4: Planning\n- Logic\n- Planning\n\n### Unit 5: Learning\n- Learning by Recording Cases\n- Incremental Concept Learning\n- Classification\n- Version Spaces &amp; Discrimination Trees\n\n### Unit 6: Analogical Reasoning\n- Case-Based Reasoning\n- Explanation-Based Learning\n- Analogical Reasoning\n\n### Unit 7: Visuospatial Reasoning\n- Constraint Propagation\n- Visuospatial Reasoning\n\n### Unit 8: Design &amp; Creativity\n- Configuration\n- Diagnosis\n- Design\n- Creativity\n\n### Unit 9: Metacognition\n- Learning by Correcting Mistakes\n- Meta-Reasoning\n- AI Ethics\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-04-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Knowledge-Based AI: Cognitive Systems", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ashok Goel", "institution_name": ["Georgia Institute of Technology", "Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/knowledge-based-ai-cognitive-systems--ud409?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
