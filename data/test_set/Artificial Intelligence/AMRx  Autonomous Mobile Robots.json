The objective of this course is to provide the basic concepts and algorithms required to develop mobile robots that act autonomously in complex environments. The main emphasis is put on mobile robot locomotion and kinematics, environment perception, probabilistic map based localization and mapping, and motion planning. The lectures and exercises of this course introduce several types of robots such as wheeled robots, legged robots and drones.\n\nThis lecture closely follows the textbook Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots by Roland Siegwart, Illah Nourbakhsh, Davide Scaramuzza, The MIT Press, second edition 2011.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-06-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "AMRx: Autonomous Mobile Robots", "price": 0, "instructors": "Martin Rufli, Davide Scaramuzza, Marco Hutter, Margarita Chli, Paul Furgale and Roland Siegwart", "institution_name": ["ETH Zurich"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/autonomous-mobile-robots-ethx-amrx-1", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
