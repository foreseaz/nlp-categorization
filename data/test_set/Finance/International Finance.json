How are exchange rates determined? When if ever are ongoing trade deficits harmful? Are fixed or floating exchange rates better? What are the roots of the euro crisis and what resolution can we expect? Does China manipulate its exchange rate and if so how does that matter? We cover all of these topics and more, with an eye toward what a person really might want to know. There is no use of mathematics in this course beyond the very basic.The interesting thing about international finance is that even a lot of professional economists don\u2019t understand it very well, unless they have specialized in the area. If you complete this course, you\u2019ll probably know a lot which they don\u2019t! We encourage you to dive in at your own pace and watch videos more than once if it's helpful.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-09-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "International Finance", "price": 0, "instructors": "Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen", "institution_name": ["George Mason University"], "commitment": "1 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "http://mruniversity.com/courses/international-finance", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["MRUniversity"], "start_date": "2015-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
