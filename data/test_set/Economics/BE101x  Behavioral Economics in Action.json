There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to \u201cnudge\u201d choice.\n\nIn three modules, learners will be able to a). explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b). learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c). design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.\n\nUnderstanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioral economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral research. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.\n\nYou will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like \u201cdoes irrationality impact welfare?\u201d or \u201cwhat strategy is better for improving welfare \u2013 nudging or education?\u201d If you\u2019ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioral economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.\n\nSeveral leading scholars, policy makers, business people,\u00a0authors and\u00a0commentators will briefly join our debate and discussion sections. These guest lecturers include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (Harvard University), Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado), Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group), Owain Service (Behavioural Insights Team, UK Cabinet Office), Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author \u2013 The Hidden Brain), Professors Andrew Ching, Avi Goldfarb, Nina Mazar, and Claire Tsai, Min Zhao (University of Toronto) and many others!\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-07-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "BE101x: Behavioral Economics in Action", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dilip Soman", "institution_name": ["University of Toronto"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/behavioral-economics-action-university-torontox-be101x-0", "duration": "91 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
