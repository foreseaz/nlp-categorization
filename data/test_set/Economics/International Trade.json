You'll have the opportunity to learn more about fundamental ideas such as comparative advantage, increasing returns to scale, factor endowments, and arbitrage across borders.  The consequences we discuss include the effects of offshoring, how trade has shaped the economies of China, Mexico, and Korea, when foreign direct investment is desirable, and the history of free trade and tariffs, among other topics.  Trade is a topic of increasing importance and this material will give you a better grasp on the theories and empirics as they have been developed by economists.\r\n\r\nThis course is non-technical and is accessible to a beginner. If you pass the final exam, you will earn our \"International Trade\" certificate on your profile.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "International Trade", "price": 0, "instructors": "Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen", "institution_name": ["George Mason University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://mruniversity.com/courses/international-trade", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["MRUniversity"], "start_date": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
