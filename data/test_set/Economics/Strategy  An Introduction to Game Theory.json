Examples of such scenarios are two firms competing for market share, politicians contesting elections, different bidders participating in an auction for wireless spectrum, coal blocks etc. Game theory provides a convenient framework to model and interpret the behavior of participants in such strategic interactions. Hence it can be applied to solve a wide variety of problems involving diverse areas such as Markets, Auctions, Online Retail, Cold War, Paying Taxes, Bargaining, Elections, Portfolio Management etc. Therefore, both undergraduate and postgraduate students and professionals from diverse backgrounds such as Scientists, Engineers, Managers, Politicians and Political Scientists, Economists, Mathematicians etc will find the course content useful. Examples and exercises will be motivated by problems close to real life scenarios.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.Normal Games and Nash Equilibrium\u00a0\r\n2.Mixed Strategies\r\n3.Various examples (Markets, Paying Taxes etc)\r\n4.Sequential Games\r\n5.Games with Incomplete Information\r\n6.Auctions\r\n7.Repeated Games\r\n8.Cooperative Games\r\n9.Bargaining and Negotiation\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory", "price": 0, "instructors": "Vimal Kumar and Aditya K.
