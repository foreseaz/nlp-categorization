The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be \"nasty, brutish and short\"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.\nAt the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.\n\nHow does this course use videos? Do I need to watch the lectures live?\nVarious videos will be released each week including lecture sequences on the topic for that week, special interview videos with leading economists, and supplementary videos for reviewing topics in economics and statistics. You can watch these at your leisure once they come available each week, though we encourage you to keep up with the pace of the course.\n\nWill the text of the lectures be available?\nYes, transcripts of the videotaped lectures will be available alongside each video.\n\nIs there a required textbook?\nRequired readings will be assigned each week. More details will be available on the syllabus.\n\nHow are grades assigned?\nGrading will be based on lecture sequence questions (25%), homework assignments (45%), a brief final project (10%), and a final exam (20%).
