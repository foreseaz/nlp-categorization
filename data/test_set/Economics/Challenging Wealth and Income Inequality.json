What form can such inequality take in different countries? What impact does it have on society? And why should it matter to you?\n\nHas the baby boomer generation had it all?\n\nThis free online course will explore the growing concerns surrounding rising inequality in income and wealth in developed countries. You\u2019ll scrutinise claims that the baby boomer generation has had it all, in terms of pension deals and affordable houses, while social and political changes have left younger generations struggling to find security for their accommodation and retirement income.\n\nYou\u2019ll examine the causes and implications of growing economic inequalities and what can be done about them, by individuals, communities and governments.\n\nCan we create a fair deal for everyone?\n\nThis four-week course is extremely timely: everyday a news report mentions the growing gap between rich and poor. In many countries, politicians and social movements are arguing about austerity policies and the future of the welfare state and public services, and how to come out of the crisis with a fair deal for everyone.\n\nYou\u2019ll explore many different alternatives to achieve a more equal world for generations to come.\n\nYour course guides are Dr Jerome De Henau, Senior Lecturer in Economics at The Open University, and Jonquil Lowe, Lecturer in Personal Finance at The Open University.\n\nYou can find out more about what to expect from this course in their post for the FutureLearn blog: \u201cMyths or realities: what do we know about wealth and income inequality?\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "Challenging Wealth and Income Inequality", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jerome De Henau", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/inequalities-in-personal-finance?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
