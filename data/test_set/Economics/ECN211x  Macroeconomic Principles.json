Economic outcomes are the result of our complex interactions with other people, businesses, the government, as well as with people and businesses globally. In this economics course, you will learn the basic stylized framework that economists use to think about, account for, measure and explain these complex interactions and outcomes.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we consider how households decide how much to work and how to spend and save money. We will also look at how businesses make economic decisions such as how many workers to hire and how many machines and buildings to use to produce their products.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we consider how different policies can potentially enhance or distort market outcomes by offsetting, alleviating, or amplifying these inefficiencies. Our focus will be on five aspects of economic policy:\n\nlabor market policies and unemployment\n\tR&amp;D and innovation policies\n\tfiscal policies and taxation\n\tmonetary policy and inflation\u00a0\n\tfree-trade policies\nThis course satisfies the Social-Behavioral Sciences (SB) general studies requirement at Arizona State University.
