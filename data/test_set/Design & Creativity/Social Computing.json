Technology has made collaboration at a distance possible in new ways that present their own set of challenges. This course will introduce you to the major challenges and opportunities for creating online communities. What does the future hold? Learn how social computing can create collaboration experiences that go beyond what\u2019s possible face to face.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Connecting People through TechnologyWhen you think of social media, you might think of a popular social network, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. These are indeed powerful, but the universe of social media is much larger. Both online and off, most everything we do has a social component that is mediated by some technology.  After all, technologies have been helping people communicate since long before your favorite curly-haired CEO dropped out of college. In this module, you\u2019ll learn about different types of social software, how to think about physical collaboration and digital collaboration using the same framework, and what the challenges to success for collaborative software are. Challenges &amp; Opportunities of Collaboration OnlineIn our always-on, pervasively connected world, it can seem as if space and distance don\u2019t matter anymore. Indeed, more and more organizations are outsourcing work around the globe and/or opening satellite locations. But being instantly reachable from anywhere in the world, isn\u2019t the same as being there. In this module, you\u2019ll learn the ways that distance does and doesn\u2019t matter, how to design for this reality and how to create technologies that go beyond being there. CrowdsourcingIt can\u2019t possibly work, can it? Slice up challenging problems into tiny pieces, distribute them to people all over the planet, and then gather their responses to piece together a solution. In this module, you\u2019ll learn both the possibilities and limits of crowdsourcing. You\u2019ll learn strategies for being able to use crowdsourcing successfully, and even hear from the voice of a professional crowdworker about what makes it successful from a worker\u2019s perspective. To gain deeper intuitions, you\u2019ll get to try it out yourself in the assignment. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Social Computing", "price": 0, "instructors": "Scott  Klemmer", "institution_name": ["University of California, San Diego "], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-computing", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
