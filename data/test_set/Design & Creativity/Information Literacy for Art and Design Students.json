Information literacy is now a core competency mandated by higher education accreditation associations for almost all U.S. colleges and universities. It goes far beyond simple web searches and equips students with the research skills necessary to find, evaluate, and appropriately use the types of information required for college level research. This course is geared toward college students, especially those majoring in art and design, but will be useful to anyone who wants to become a more effective searcher. Students will explore the \u201cdeep web\u201d (information not found through search engines) and experiment with various search strategies and filtering techniques. Students will also be encouraged to explore resources found in local libraries.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-11-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Information Literacy for Art and Design Students", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/information-literacy-for-art-and-design-students", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
