{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Design & Creativity"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Typography is the art of manipulating the visual form of language to enrich and control its meaning. It\u2019s an essential area of skill and knowledge for graphic designers. Typography predates modern graphic design by around 500 years; it is rich in rules, conventions, and esoteric terminology\u2014but it remains an exciting space for invention and expression.\n\nIn this rigorous introductory course, we will study, name, and measure the characteristics of letterforms. We\u2019ll consider the pragmatic concerns involved in selecting and combining type. We\u2019ll peek into the \u2028rich historical, cultural, and aesthetic histories of familiar typefaces. We\u2019ll discuss time-tested conventions and best practices in setting type, as governed by principles of hierarchy and spatial organization. And we\u2019ll explore the expressive, meaning-making potential of type. \n\nInformative lectures will be complemented by a series of three peer-assessed assignments, culminating \u2028in an opportunity to design a full-scale typographic poster.\n\nPlease note that this is not a software course; a basic working knowledge of Adobe InDesign or other \u2028page layout software will be assumed. You will need access to a computer and page layout software, such as InDesign, to complete the assignments.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Talking TypeThis week, we\u2019ll take an up-close look at typefaces, both as physical artifacts and as works of design. \u2028We will study the formal elements that define and give character to type, and understand where they came from and why they look the way they do. We will review the terminology and measuring system used to describe type, and look at the way the form and proportion of letters relate to the practical concerns of selecting and combining typefaces. The week will wrap up with a graded quiz.Week 2: Typefaces and their StoriesThis week, we\u2019ll explore the way typefaces express connotative meaning\u2014tell stories\u2014through their association with different time periods, aesthetics, and ideas. Through six short case studies, we \u2028will look at the way a typeface\u2019s connotations are shaped by its context, understand the historic evolution of typographic forms, and familiarize ourselves with the way typefaces are classified. You\u2019ll extend \u2028your exploration through some independent research into a typeface of your choosing.Week 3: Putting Type to WorkThis week, we will engage the visual principles and conventions of typesetting. We will look at how the spaces between letters, lines, and blocks of type can be manipulated to refine the appearance and control the meaning of type. We\u2019ll explore the ways typographic hierarchy and grid systems can further organize and clarify type. And we\u2019ll survey the rules and conventions that can add polish to your typesetting. You\u2019ll apply your skills and knowledge in a peer-reviewed typesetting exercise at the end \u2028of the week.Week 4: Making Meaningful TypeIn our final week, we\u2019ll examine the ways typographic form can dramatically shape the meaning of written language. We\u2019ll survey and analyze possibilities for type treatments\u2014from subtle typesetting choices\u2028 to dramatic manipulations\u2014by looking at examples of expressive and unconventional typography. At the end of the week, you\u2019ll bring together and apply everything you have learned in this course in the \u2028design of a full-scale typographic poster.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Typography", "price": 0, "instructors": "Anther Kiley", "institution_name": ["California Institute of the Arts"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/typography", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
