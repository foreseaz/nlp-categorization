Prototyping is a crucial part of this process. Building prototypes gives you a chance to get your ideas out of your head and into the hands of the people you're designing for. By getting feedback early and often, and continuing to improve your idea, you'll be well on your way to getting useful ideas and solutions out into the world.This four-week course builds on Design Kit: The Course for Human-Centered Design, a class that has been taken by thousands of teams around the world. The curriculum will strengthen your existing knowledge of the human-centered design process and help you to become a more innovative problem solver by building up your prototyping skills. You'll walk away knowing how to prototype products, services, and environments, and get constructive feedback along the way.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-28T00:00:00Z", "title": "Design Kit: Prototyping", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Ideo.org"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/prototyping-2016-2", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
