We will discuss the key variables involved in structuring \"effective\" coaching that results in lasting changes in teacher practice and ultimately more classroom learning. We recommend approaching material by first watching lecture videos and then doing to associated reading. Afterwards, the quiz is a summative assessment that allows you to demonstrate mastery of Module One material. MindsetLectures during the Module 2 will introduce students to the first variable in our Effective Coaching Formula, the Fixed Mindset Tax. We draw heavily on the work of psychologist Carol Dweck to frame the extent to which a teacher's mindset can greatly influence the effectiveness of a coaching intervention. Module 2 will offer strategies for overcoming common behaviors associated with fixed mindset, the belief that one cannot improve at a particular skill. We will also demonstrate how combating these behaviors could also help you promote Growth Mindset, the attitude of optimism and investment in improving. Instructional VisionModule 3 explains the second variable in our formula, the Clarity of Instructional Vision -- the extent to which coach and teacher agree on and can communicate effectively about what constitutes excellent instruction. This variable is key in developing common language, goal setting, and maintaining urgency in the coaching context. While there are numerous philosophies for what excellent instruction looks like, this week will also introduce participants to the Match Teacher Residency's \"student-facing\" vision for optimal classroom culture.
