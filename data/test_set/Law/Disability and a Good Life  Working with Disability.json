But what is disability?  It\u2019s often assumed that people with disabilities can\u2019t have a good life. But what is a good life?\n\nIn this course, and its sister course Thinking through Disability, we\u2019ll reflect on how disability is part of who we are as human beings. These courses will give you and your fellow learners the opportunity to think through and work with some of the big issues facing societies, governments and disabled people.\n\nWork with disability\n\nToday we recognise disability as a part of human diversity. But what does it mean to work with disability in a way that enables a good life for ourselves and others? In this course, we will explore a human rights approach to disability and examine how disability politics and policy, advocacy and activism can inform what we mean by a good life.\n\nTo begin, you\u2019ll reflect on the meaning and significance of human diversity. As you move through the topics, you will engage with different approaches to disability by examining the concepts of inclusion, access and support. At the end of the course we will challenge you to consider how you work with disability to enable a good life for all.\n\nLearn in a variety of ways\n\nIn this free online course, you can choose your pathway through the materials.
