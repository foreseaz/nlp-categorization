{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Law"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This online course will introduce you to American laws related to terrorism and the prevention of terrorism. My approach to the topic is the case-study method. Each week, we will read a case study, along with the statutes, regulations, and other law-related materials relevant to the case. We\u2019ll see how the case was handled in court and what reforms were enacted following the trial.\r\n\r\nEach week\u2019s assignment will include copies of the relevant laws and court rules, a glossary of terms, background readings, and other supplementary materials.\r\n\r\nThe course will commence with the first attempt by Islamic militants to bring down the World Trade Center towers with a truck bomb in 1993. From there, I'll take you through the major terrorist incidents of the past 20 years, including acts perpetrated by homegrown terrorists, such as the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 and the trial of the SHAC Seven (animal rights) terrorists in Trenton (NJ) in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe textbook for this course is Counter Terrorism Issues: Case Studies in the Courtroom, by Jim Castagnera (estimated cost: $100) Find it at CRC Press.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-10-28T00:00:00Z", "title": "American Counter Terrorism Law", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Castagnera", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/american-counter-terrorism-law-1", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
