During the first two MOOCs, we focused on specific techniques for specific applications. Instead, with this third MOOC, we provide you with different examples  to open your mind to different applications from different industries and sectors.\nThe objective is to give you an helicopter overview on what's happening in this field. You will see how the tools presented in the two previous courses of the Specialization are used in real life projects. \nWe want to ignite your reflection process. Hence, you will best make use of the Accenture cases by watching first the MOOC and then investigate by yourself on the different concepts, industries, or challenges that are introduced during the videos.\n\nAt the end of this course learners will be able to: \n- identify the possible applications of business analytics,\n- hence, reflect on the possible solutions and added-value applications that could be proposed for their capstone project.\n\nThe cases will be presented by senior practitioners from Accenture with different backgrounds in term of industry, function, and country.  Special attention will be paid to the \"value case\" of the issue raised to prepare you for the capstone project of the specialization.\n\nAbout Accenture\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
