The course aim to cover statistical ideas that apply to managers. We will consider two basic themes: first, is recognizing and describing variations present in everything around us, and then modeling and making decisions in the presence of these variations. The fundamental concepts studied in this course will reappear in many other classes and business settings. Our focus will be on  interpreting the meaning of the results in a business and managerial setting.\n\nWhile you will be introduced to some of the science of what is being taught, the focus will be on applying the methodologies.  This will be accomplished through use of Excel and using data sets from many different disciplines, allowing you to see the use of statistics in very diverse settings. The course will focus not only on explaining these concepts but also understanding the meaning of the results obtained.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tTest for beliefs about a population..\n\u2022\tCompare differences between populations.\n\u2022\tUse linear regression model for prediction. \n\u2022\tLearn how to use Excel for statistical analysis.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Module 1: Hypothesis TestingWatch any infomercial and you hear many outrageous promises.  Use this cream and your skin will look 80% firmer!  Use this supplement and you will lose 10 pounds in the first 10 days!  Are they telling you the truth?  Are they all lying? The only way to know the answer to any of these questions is to scientifically test the claim being made \u2013 that is what we call hypothesis testing and what we will learn in this module.Module 2: Statistical Inference Based on Two SamplesDoes the medicine a person is taking to treat his condition really work better than a sugar pill?  Is the new chip-enabled credit card more secure than the magnetic card? How do you know whether the claims being made about anything being \u201cbetter than\u201d or \u201cfaster than\u201d a competitor are true?  In this module we will learn to make this comparison.Module 3: Simple Linear RegressionDoes your job involve a lot of sitting?  If so, you are at higher risk of coronary heart disease.  How do I know this?  We got to know the relationship between coronary heart disease and sitting when researchers studied a cohort of London bus drivers and bus conductors from 1947 to 1972.  If you want to know more, then read on!Module 4: Multiple Linear RegressionYou are trying to predict next month\u2019s sales numbers.  You know that dozens, maybe even hundreds, of things like the weather, competitor\u2019s promotions, rumors, etc. can impact the number. You talk to five people and each one has an idea about what makes the biggest impact, and the only thing they offer is \u201ctrust me.\u201d  Do you wish there was a better way of doing this rather than relying on blind faith?  Well, there is.  We can use Multiple Regression to sort through this mess and bring the focus to factors that really do matter.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Inferential and Predictive Statistics for Business", "price": 0, "instructors": "Fataneh Taghaboni-Dutta", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-statistics", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
