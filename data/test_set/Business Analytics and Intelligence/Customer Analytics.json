From credit card transactions and online shopping carts, to customer loyalty programs and user-generated ratings/reviews, there is a staggering amount of data that can be used to describe our past buying behaviors, predict future ones, and prescribe new ways to influence future purchasing decisions. In this brand new course, four of Wharton\u2019s top marketing professors will dive deeper into the key areas of customer analytics: descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and their application to real-world business practices including Amazon, Google, and Starbucks to name a few. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand how data is used to describe, explain, and predict customer behavior; best practices for using this data to prescribe more effective business strategies; and how successful companies are currently using such data to meet (and shape) customer needs, and to increase their bottom line in the process.  This course has been designed to help you make better business decisions about emerging data structures, so that you can apply what you\u2019ve learned to your own company or business today.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to Customer AnalyticsWhat is Customer Analytics?
