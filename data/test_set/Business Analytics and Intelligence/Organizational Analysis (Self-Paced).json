Broughton MBAIt is hard to imagine living in modern society without participating in or interacting with organizations. The ubiquity and variability of organizations means there is ample room for complexity and confusion in the organizational challenges we regularly\nface. Through this course, students will consider cases describing various organizational struggles: school systems and politicians attempting to implement education reforms; government administrators dealing with an international crisis; technology firms\ntrying to create a company ethos that sustains worker commitment; and even two universities trying to gain international standing by performing a merger.\n\nEach case is full of details and complexity. So how do we make sense of organizations and the challenges they face, let alone develop means of managing them in desired directions? While every detail can matter, some matter more than others. This is why\nwe rely on organizational theories -- to focus our attention and draw out relevant features in a sensible way.\n\nThrough this self-paced course you will come to see that there is nothing more practical than a good theory. In every module, you\u2019ll learn a different organizational theory, and it will become a lens through which you can interpret concrete organizational situations.\nArmed with a toolset of theories, you will then be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it \u2013 and use the theories to predict which actions will best redirect the organization in a desired direction.Join your future classmates and course alumni on\u00a0Facebook!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1: Introduction\nModule 2: Decisions by rational and rule-based procedures\nModule 3: Decisions by dominant coalitions\nModule 4: Decisions in organized anarchies\nModule 5: Developing organizational learning and intelligence\nModule 6: Developing an organizational culture\nModule 7: Managing resource dependencies\nModule 8: Network forms of organization\nModule 9: Institutions and organizational legitimacy\nModule 10: Summary\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-12-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Organizational Analysis (Self-Paced)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Daniel A.
