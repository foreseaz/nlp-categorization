The course provides the first complete, easy introduction to this fascinating discipline.\r\nDuring the course, many spectacular ancient sites \u2013 such as Stonehenge in England, Giza and Karnak in Egypt, Chichen Itz\u00e1 in the Yucatan, Macchu Picchu in Peru and the Pantheon in Rome \u2013 will be visited and the fascinating events occurring there in special days of the year (such as solstices, equinoxes, or the day of the foundation of Rome) will be shown and explained. The course also provides the necessary background on Astronomy with the naked eye and a general introduction to the role of Astronomy in religion and in the management of power among ancient cultures.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "ArchAstr101 - Archaeoastronomy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Giulio Magli", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.pok.polimi.it/courses/course-v1:Polimi+ArchAstr101+2016_M5/about", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Polimi OPEN KNOWLEDGE"], "start_date": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
