We often have a vision of the right policies or strategies for improving health, safety, and economic well being, but the real problem is getting things done. Even a simple policy intervention such as child vaccination requires much more than nurses and a stock of vaccine to be effective.\n\nCase studies are a vital tool for sharing insight about the how of policy implementation and institutional reform. They trace the steps taken to produce results, show solutions people have devised to address anticipated challenges and overcome unanticipated obstacles. Case studies help us think about how to adapt approaches so that they work in different contexts.\n\nThis social science course is most suitable for:\n\nPractitioners who want to document and analyze their efforts to implement a program or build a new institution\n\tResearchers who want to trace how programs achieved results\n\tGraduate students who want an introduction to one type of case study method\nNo certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will be awarded in connection with this course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "CaseStudies101x: Writing Case Studies: Science of Delivery", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jennifer Widner and Pallavi Nuka", "institution_name": ["Princeton University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/writing-case-studies-science-delivery-princetonx-casestudies101x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
