{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Grammar & Writing"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This course revolves around the work of revising writing, learning, and engaging with language and community. You will explore who you are as a learner as you write about yourself and your language use, as well as consider who you are as a communicator as you critique texts, persuade audiences, and collaborate with others. We've designed this course to help you revise how you write and to help you collect a toolkit of effective reading, writing, and learning strategies. Each of the four modules integrates academic and social contexts (e.g., Facebook, ELI peer review application) to encourage a wide application of the skills you acquire during the course.\r\nThe skills you will practice in this course (like narration, summary, etc.) are fairly typical for writing classes at many U.S. universities; however, our course focuses on you as a writer and thinker. Recognizing specific learning and communication practices and considering ways to employ them can make you more successful in future coursework and in all communication.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-08-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Thinking Like a Writer", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jeff Grabill and Julie Lindquist", "institution_name": ["Michigan State University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/thinking-like-a-writer-1", "duration": "9 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
