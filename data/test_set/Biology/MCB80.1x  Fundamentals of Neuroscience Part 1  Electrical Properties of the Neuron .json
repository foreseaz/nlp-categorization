{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Biology"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Fundamentals of Neuroscience is a three part course that explores the structure and function of the nervous system -- from the microscopic inner workings of a single nerve cell, to the staggering complexity of the brain, and beyond to the social interactions and societal dynamics that our brains make possible.\n\nIn this first module\u00a0we\u2019ll look at how individual neurons use electricity to transmit information.\u00a0 We\u2019ll invite you to build up a neuron, piece by piece, using interactive simulations, and we\u2019ll take you on field trips in and around Harvard and Boston, bring you into the lab, and show you how to conduct DIY neuroscience experiments on your own.\n\nLessons will include video content, interactive content, forum spaces associated with the lessons, and in Lessons 3, labs and lab content.\n\nYou can move around within the lessons at your own pace. The only 'graded' part of the course is your final exam. You don't have to get everything correct to 'complete' lessons, you just have to engage with the content!\u00a0\n\nPlease note that this course is\u00a0NOT hosted on the edX platform, but can be found at \u00a0www.mcb80x.org.\u00a0To receive a certificate for this course, you must register for the course through EdX and successfully complete the\u00a0final exam during an established exam period.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the\u00a0edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations. Enrollees who are taking HarvardX courses as part of another program will also be governed by the academic policies of those programs.\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning. By registering as an online learner in an HX course, you will also participate in research about learning. Read our\u00a0research statement\u00a0to learn more.\n\nHarvard University and HarvardX are committed to maintaining a safe and healthy educational and work environment in which no member of the community is excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination or harassment in our program.
