{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Biology"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Welcome to the class! We are excited that you want to explore your body's place in the world. Your body is an amazing machine that is equipped with the capacity to deal with the world's great stressors.\r\nThis course may be different from other courses you may have taken online. Our intention is to create more than just a class conveying information; we want to create an educational experience. You will be engaged in stories about physiology from across the country, develop relationships with the instructors as they sacrifice their bodies for the good of science, and be awed by the complexity and adaptability of the human body. You will also have the opportunity to hear from top scientists and adventurers in the field. The class will illustrate and explain how your body responds to cold, heat, stress, age, altitude, g-forces, diving and zero gravity. Video travel locations include Stanford, Harvard, MIT, US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, Pikes Peak, Las Vegas, and Livermore California.\r\nCheck out the\u00a0promo video\u00a0to get a flavor of the adventure.\r\nBuckle up! We hope you enjoy the ride.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPREREQUISITES\r\nAn excitement for storytelling and learning about the human body!\r\nThe course aims to be accessible to everyone. However, it is still challenging. A background in basic human physiology will prepare you to get the most out of this experience.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nColdThe storytelling adventure begins at Stanford University in a thermoregulation laboratory. Just thinking about it gives us goosebumps. Poor Corey! Look forward to learning about piloerection, hypothermia, after-drop, and some practical tips on dealing with the cold.\r\nHeatThe EnvPhyz team is back on Stanford campus exploring the effect of heat on the body. There's no air conditioning in this section. Look forward to learning about hyperthermia, cooling techniques, heat injuries and some practical tips on dealing with the heat.\r\nAgingThe EnvPhyz team gets old! Get ready for a trip to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to learn about the impacts of time (age) on our physiology. With age comes wisdom, so be prepared to glean a few gems from this section and learn some tips that could change the trajectory of your aging. Look forward to learning about the causes of age-associated changes; which ones are inevitable and which ones you can influence.\r\nStressThe EnvPhyz team throws a big curveball as last minute changes make a big impact on the story. Anne and Corey give their bodies to science to explore stress and its affect on your body. This section is sure to elevate your heart rate, so get ready for a wild ride! Look forward to learning about the stress response, chronic stress, and some practical tips on how to manage stress in your daily life.\r\nAltitudeThe team travels to the Army Research Station near Boston and to Pikes Peak, Colorado, to get you up close and personal with altitude research. Expect some adventures, good science, and rough transitions to altitude exposure. Look forward to learning about acute altitude exposure, chronic altitude exposure, serious altitude risks and some practical tips on preparing for that next trip up to the mountains.\r\nVariable PressuresAfter being subjected to so many environmental conditions, Corey finally gets his opportunity to strike back. Expect some high flying adventures into the world of variable pressures. Look forward to learning about g-forces, zero gravity, and the high pressures of deep water diving.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE TEAM\r\n\r\nThe EnvPhyz team is composed of professors, students, storytellers and video producers. We interface with academic researchers and real life people in order to create an experience that draws students closer to science. We make fun, experiential videos on each topic that lead the student into other supporting online learning materials that explain the underlying physiology. Support for this project comes from the Stanford Vice Provost for Online Learning (VPOL), the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, and the Program in Human Biology.\r\n\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-23T00:00:00Z", "title": "Your Body in the World: Adapting to Your Next Big Adventure", "price": 0, "instructors": "Anne L.
