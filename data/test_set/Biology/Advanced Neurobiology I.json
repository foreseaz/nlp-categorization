Welcome to advanced neurobiology!\n\nNeuroscience is a wonderful branch of science on how our brain perceives the external world, how our brain thinks, how our brain responds to the outside of the world, and how during disease or aging the neuronal connections deteriorate. We\u2019re trying to understand the molecular, cellular nature and the circuitry arrangement of how nervous system works.\n\nThrough this course, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of basic neuroanatomy, electral signal transduction, movement and several diseases in the nervous system. \n\nThis advanced neurobiology course is composed of 2 parts (Advanced neurobiology I and Advanced neurobiology II, and the latter will be online in late April or May). They are related to each other on the content but separate on scoring and certification, so you can choose either or both. It\u2019s recommended that you take them sequentially and it\u2019s great if you\u2019ve already acquired a basic understanding of biology.\n\nThank you for joining us!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Anatomy of the Nervous SystemLet's start with a basic introduction of neuroanatomy. Morphology of the neuronal cell &amp; Cellular and Molecular Biology of the NeuronLet's learn more about the basic unit of the nervous system: the neuron.Cellular and Molecular Biology of the NeuronLet\u2018s continue with the neuron.Signaling within neurons &amp; Ion channels and membrane potentialsLet's switch to the electrical properties of the neuron.Ion channels, membrane potential and synaptic transmissionLet's continue with the ion channels, membrane potential and synaptic transmission.Neurotransmitter releaseLet's learn more about the neurotransmitter release.Synaptic transmission &amp; Synapitic plasticityLet's continue with synaptic transmission and synapitic plasticity.Techniques in neuroscienceLet's learn some prevalent techniques in neuroscience.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Advanced Neurobiology I", "price": 0, "instructors": "Yan Zhang and Yulong Li", "institution_name": ["Peking University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-neurobiology1", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
