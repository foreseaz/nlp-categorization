As the course progresses, the structure and function of important organs will be demonstrated, discussed and related to common surgical scenarios and current research. Each of the three weeks will focus on a specific area of the abdomen; starting at the surface you will then enter the abdomen and be able to detail the anatomy of numerous organs including the stomach and liver.\n\nAt the end of each week subject specialists such as surgeons, pathologists and radiologists will come together to compare and discuss contrasting surgical techniques. This will help you to apply your understanding of basic anatomy to common clinical scenarios and research being undertaken at the University of Leeds.\n\nFor example, in the first week of the course you will examine the complex anatomy of the abdominal wall and discover why this area is of particular interest to surgeons during inguinal hernia repair.\n\nIn this course your tutor James Pickering will take you on a journey to explore the depths of the human abdomen.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThis course has been certified by the CPD Certification Service as conforming to continuing professional development principles. By completing the course you will have achieved 12 hours of CPD time.\n\nThis course will also give you the opportunity to purchase a Statement of Participation which you can use as evidence of your engagement in the course.\n\nIf you want to demonstrate your knowledge further, you can register for an end-of-course exam to earn a Statement of Attainment.\n\nThis optional formal exam has been set by the team at the University of Leeds and is based on the contents of the course. You will be able to sit the exam at various test centres across the world after the end of the course. There will be a choice of exam dates (dates to be confirmed).\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Exploring Anatomy: the Human Abdomen", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Pickering", "institution_name": ["University of Leeds"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/anatomy?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
