An investigation of alleles, traits, genotypes, phenotypes, genetic crosses, and the role of dominance is used to explore simple Mendelian genetics, as well as the use of pedigrees.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Basic Genetics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Wendy Noffke", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/basic-genetics", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
