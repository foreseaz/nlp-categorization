A new genetics for 21st century studentsWho might want to take this course?\n\n    People affected by or concerned about a genetic disease (either directly or in a family member)\n    People interested in the genetic diversity of humans or other species\n    People who have had (or are considering having) their genes or genomes analyzed by companies such as 23andMe\n    People concerned about the public use of personal genetic information\n    People interested in breeding animals or plants, or in in conservation of endangered species\n    People interested in genealogy and ancestry analysisHealth care professionals\n    Science teachers\n    Anyone interested in genetics but unable to enroll in university at this time\n    \n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Useful Genetics is taught in two parts.\u00a0 Students in Part 1 may want to also sign up for the separate course Useful Genetics Part 2.Part 1. \u00a0Genes and their effects (6 weekly modules plus a final exam week)\nModule\u00a01. How different\nare we?\u00a0 Introduction to DNA, genes and chromosomes and the relationships\n    between human populations.\u00a0 Ancestral interbreeding with Neanderthals.\nModule\u00a02. How DNA molecules change. \u00a0The causes and immediate consequences of mutations.\n\nModule\u00a03. DNA differences\nand gene functions. \u00a0How mutations that change gene activity or function affect the properties of organisms. \u00a0Module\u00a04. Mutations in regulatory genes. How mutations cause cancer. Sex determination and genes on sex chromosomes.\u00a0\nModule\u00a05.\n\u00a0Natural genetic variation. How natural genetic variation is studied, and how it differs from classical alleles. Heritability and genome-wide association studies. \u00a0Genetic variation for cancer risks.\nModule\u00a06. \u00a0Personal\ngenomics. \u00a0Kinds of DNA typing and genome analysis, and what\n    can be learned from them about health risks, personal attributes and ancestry.Part 2. \u00a0Inheritance (taught as the separate course Useful Genetics Part 2) \u00a0(5 weekly modules plus a final exam week)Module\u00a07. \u00a0The mechanics of inheritance.\u00a0\u00a0How genes and chromosomes are transmitted through the generations (including the molecular mechanisms of mitosis and meiosis).Module\u00a08. \u00a0Genetic analysis.\u00a0\u00a0Using genetic crosses as a research tool to investigate how genes work and what they do. \u00a0Sex-linkage, pedigree analysis, and hypothesis testing.Module\u00a09. All about breeding and inbreeding.\u00a0\u00a0More about heritability and association studies. Inbreeding in humans, crops and livestock, and evolution.\u00a0Hybrids and genetically modified organisms.Module\u00a010. \u00a0Chromosomal changes.\u00a0 Changes in the number of chromosomes and in how genes are arranged on them.\u00a0 Genome evolution.Module\u00a011. \u00a0Selected advanced topics.\u00a0\u00a0The origin of life, mitochondrial genes and mutations, genetic mosaicism, fetal DNA in mothers, epigenetic inheritance, and other topics students may suggest.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-10-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "Useful Genetics Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Rosemary Redfield", "institution_name": ["The University of British Columbia"], "commitment": "6-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/usefulgenetics", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
