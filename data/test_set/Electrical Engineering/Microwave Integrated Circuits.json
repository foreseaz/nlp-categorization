Sice at microwave frequencies, the distributed circuit effects become very prominent, new circuit theories based on Maxwells laws have to be introduces. Further new circuit design techniques as well as new circuit elements are also introduced. The first part of the course deals with the basics of theory. In the later part, the design of various microwave devices like couplers, circulators, filters and amplifiers is introduced. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1Introduction, Transmission Line Theory Transmission line equations, Reflection Coefficient, VSWRImpedance using lumped elements, Smith Chart (Z, Y and Z-Y Smith chart)Applications of the Smith ChartIntroduction to stripline, CPW and microstrip transmission lineWeek 2Broadband Impedance matchingThe quarter-wave transformer, theory of small reflectionsMulti-section transformerMaximally flat (binomial) transformerChebyshev transformerNon uniform transmission lineWeek 3Scattering ParametersImpedance matrix, Admittance matrixPassive reciprocal loss-less two port junctionsGeneral two-port networkPower gain/loss, Signal flow graph, Transducer power gain/loss ABCD parametersWeek 4Passive Components (and Applications)1 and2 Port passive components, TeesCirculators, Power Divider Directional Coupler, Rat race and branch line couplersCoupled lines: even mode, odd mode analysisWeek 5Introduction to filter design\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Filter design: Image parameter method, Insertion loss methodInsertion loss method: Equiripple, Maximally flat, Linear phase low pass filter designFilter transformation: Impedance, frequency scaling; Bandpass-bandstop transformationRichards transformation, Kuroda\u2019s Identity, Impedance-admittance inverterNarrowband bandstop filters, Narrowband bandpass filters, Multisection bandpass filtersWeek 6Stepped impedance low pass filterCoupled line filtersReview of resonant circuitsBandpass and bandstop using quarterwave resonatorDirect-coupled and capacitively coupled resonatorsMultisection bandpass filtersWeek 7Amplifier power gainStability circles, Constant-gain circlesNoise figure, Noise figure in cascaded network Constant noise figure circlesLNA designWeek 8Oscillator basics, two port oscillation conditionFeedback oscillators, one port negative resistance oscillators\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Microwave Integrated Circuits", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jayanta Mukherjee", "institution_name": ["IIT(Indian Institute of Technology Bombay)"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_ec02", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2016-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
