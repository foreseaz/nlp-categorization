At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\u00a0\n\nCourse videos are presented in Mandarin with English subtitles.\n\nThe principles of electric circuits are critical for electrical engineering and computer science students. In this course, we will cover linear and nonlinear resistive circuits, and dynamic circuits in time and phasor domains. In addition to learning critical methods for analyzing circuits, the course will discuss modern circuit elements, such as MOSFETs and Op Amps, used in cutting-edge technologies. This course provides a solid introduction to the real-world application of electric circuits. You will gain a deeper understanding of the important role circuits play in our lives.\n\nFor the part 2 of the course, dynamic circuits containing capacitors and/or inductors will be the main actors. Plenty of excellent examples will be discussed.\n\n\u7535\u8def\u539f\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u662f\u7535\u7c7b\u5404\u4e13\u4e1a\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u95e8\u5b66\u79d1\u57fa\u7840\u8bfe\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u5404\u4e13\u4e1a\u57fa\u7840\u8bfe\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bfe\u90fd\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u8fd9\u95e8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u662f\u7535\u7c7b\u4e13\u4e1a\u672c\u79d1\u751f\u7684\u201c\u770b\u5bb6 \u8bfe\u201d\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u7535\u8def\u539f\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u963b\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u963b\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6b63\u5f26\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u67904\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66\u7535 \u8def\u539f\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5f53\u4ee3\u7535\u8def\u5143\u5668\u4ef6\u3001\u7535\u8def\u539f\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u7b49\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002 \u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u7b2c2\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bb2\u6388\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7535\u5bb9\u548c\u7535\u611f\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89d2\u3002\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c06\u8ba8\u8bba\u4f17\u591a\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-04-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "20220332_2x: Principles of Electric Circuits: Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Xinjie Yu", "institution_name": ["Tsinghua University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/tsinghuax/tsinghuax-202203322x-principles-electric-1319", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2014-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
