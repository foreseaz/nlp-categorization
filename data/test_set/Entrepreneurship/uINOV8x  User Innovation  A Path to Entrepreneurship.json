Innovation isn\u2019t confined inside the walls of research labs swarming with PhDs. More often than not, innovation is about ordinary people solving problems that matter to them personally. This could be you.\n\nFirst, think about what you need. Next, find out\u00a0whether\u00a0others want the same thing. If they do, you can start a venture \u2013 for profit or non-profit - to supply others with the novel product or service you first developed for yourself.\n\nThe examples of user innovation are infinite. A surfer created the GoPro to take \u201cselfies\u201d while surfing. A student came up with Dropbox after forgetting his flash drive. Two broke entrepreneurs rented out their living room to help pay rent, and Airbnb was born. They\u2019ll share their paths to startup success.\n\nTaught by Eric von Hippel, the founding scholar of user innovation, this course will help you think about what problems you should choose to solve and how to share your innovations with others.\n\nYou\u00a0can innovate.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-07-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "uINOV8x: User Innovation: A Path to Entrepreneurship", "price": 0, "instructors": "Eric von Hippel", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/user-innovation-path-entrepreneurship-mitx-uinov8x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
