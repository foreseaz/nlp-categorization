Now how do you assess whether you're really reaching your target market? Customers at the bottom of the pyramid are diverse. They span different ages, poverty levels and occupations and use products and services in different ways. The more you know about your target customers, the better you can develop strategies and offerings that meet their needs.\r\nThis Short Course from +Acumen and Grameen Foundation will teach you about market segmentation, or how to divide your market into clusters that have relatively similar needs. You'll learn about the Progress Out of Poverty Index; understand the nuts and bolts of market segmentation; complete a customer segmentation matrix; and start to build customer personas so that you can better identify who you're targeting and design products or programs with them in mind. We'll draw from case studies of companies who have used the Progress Out of Poverty Index to collect meaningful customer insights. After this course, you'll be better prepared to implement market segmentation and use survey tools that can yield important insights about your customers.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "Market Segmentation at the Bottom of the Pyramid", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "1 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/market-segmentation-q3-2015", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2015-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
