Learn about such fundamental distributed computing \"concepts\" for cloud computing.\n\nSome of these concepts include: Clouds, MapReduce, key-value stores, Classical precursors, Widely-used algorithms, Classical algorithms, Scalability, Trending areas, And more!\n\nUnderstand how these techniques work inside today\u2019s most widely-used cloud computing systems. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the optional programming track, implement some of these concepts in template assignments provided in C++ programming language.\n\nYou will also watch interviews with leading managers and researchers, from both industry and academia.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Orientation, Introduction to Clouds, MapReduce Week 2: Gossip, Membership, and GridsWeek 3: P2P SystemsWeek 4: Key-Value Stores, Time, and OrderingWeek 5: Classical Distributed Algorithms\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Indranil Gupta", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "4-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
