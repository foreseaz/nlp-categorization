The security of the most popular Public-Key Cryptosystems are based either on the hardness of factoring or the presumed intractability of the discrete logarithm problem. Advances on these problems or the construction of large quantum computers would dramatically change the landscape: Code-Based Cryptography is a powerful and promising alternative.The objective of this course is to present the state of the art of these cryptosystems. This MOOC covers the essentials that you should know about this hot topic in Cryptography and Coding Theory: the security-reduction proofs, the possible attacks, several proposals to reduce the key-size, etc.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1Error-Correcting Codes and CryptographyWeek 2McEliece CryptosystemWeek 3Message Attacks (ISD)Week 4Key AttacksWeek 5Other cryptographic constructions relying on coding theory\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-22T00:00:00Z", "title": "Code-Based Cryptography", "price": 0, "instructors": "Matthieu Finiasz, Nicolas Sendrier and Irene M\u00e1rquez-Corbella", "institution_name": ["Inria (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation)"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41006/session01/about", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["France Universit\u00e9 Numerique"], "start_date": "2015-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
