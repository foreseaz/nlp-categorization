What are the barriers to participating in education? How do you include \u201call\u201d in the classroom?\n\nOver the next three weeks we will be exploring some answers to these and other questions with you. This is very timely as a new global universal sustainable development goal (SDG) has just been set.  SDG 4 urges us to \u201cEnsure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning\u201d.\n\nEnsuring inclusion and equity in education\n\nWe will examine issues related to inclusion and equity in education, and think about how we can support the learning of those who are marginalised and excluded.\n\nDuring the course, you will meet key individuals who work \u201con the ground\u201d with young people who are or have been marginalised and excluded from their right to education. You will also meet academics involved in  teacher education.\n\nTogether, we will reflect on the conundrum of why some young people are still marginalised and excluded from learning, thus requiring us to \u201cbreak down the barriers,\u201d so that they can participate in education.\n\nStrengthening capacity within and through teachers and teacher education will in turn strengthen a country\u2019s capacity to build an inclusive learning environment,  so we will also look to the future and consider how educators can provide learning experiences that take account of all learners.\n\nBreaking down the barriers to education\n\nThere will be plenty of opportunities for you to share your experiences, so we can learn from each other.\nBy the end of the course you will be able to:\n\n Understand the international legislation relating to Education for All, children\u2019s rights, inclusion and disability; \n Identify and discuss the barriers faced by groups of learners that are disenfranchised from educational opportunities; \n Describe different ways of breaking down the barriers that exist for some groups of learners; \n Discuss the complexity of inclusive education and understand why issues of social justice and equity along with attitudes and understanding are critical to the achievement of inclusive practices for learners.\n\n\nYou can follow the team behind this course on Twitter - @UofGInclusiveEd.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Right to Education: Breaking Down the Barriers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Margaret Sutherland", "institution_name": ["University of Glasgow"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/right-to-education?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
