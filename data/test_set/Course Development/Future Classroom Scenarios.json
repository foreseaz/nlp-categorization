The course is designed in response to the increasing challenges faced by educators around the world to accommodate the rising importance of technology in education and the impact this has on teaching and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course covers six modules which introduce you to key concepts like 21st century skills and allow you to exchange with your peers about your own experiences of trying out new activities and technologies in the classroom. During the course we will also reflect and discuss the role of technology tools in the future classroom and your current teaching and learning environments. A number of tools are introduced which help the process of innovation in the school and classroom but are equally useful for your everyday teaching practices.\r\nThe course is run by teachers for teachers and most of the learning will happen collaboratively so you will be asked to actively participate and share your thoughts and ideas with the other course members. We will be using a variety of tools that allow a collaborative learning process.\r\nYou will also be asked to test some of the ideas and activities presented on the course in your classrooms, providing feedback about successes and challenges and helping each other in evaluating your ideas and activities.\r\nAt the end of the course you will receive an electronic certificate of participation.\r\nFollow announcements on the course via Twitter\u00a0#FCScourse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-09-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Future Classroom Scenarios", "price": 0, "instructors": "William Ellis and Benjamin Hertz", "institution_name": ["European Schoolnet Academy"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/future-classroom-scenarios-2nd-round", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2014-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
