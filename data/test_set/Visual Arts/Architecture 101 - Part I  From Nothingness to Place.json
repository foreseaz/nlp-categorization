To transform a place into a state of mind.\r\nArchitecture 101:\r\nArchitecture to convert a place into a state of mind. Apparently a simple task, actually a fairly tricky operation. To (try to) understand, we split our journey into three parts. This course is about part 1: from nothingness to place (part 2\u00a0is from place to space,\u00a0part 3\u00a0is from space to architecture).\r\nWhat is a place? What is space? How do we make space? How do we prepare our mind to make space?\r\nWithout a concept, we can\u2019t have a place. Without a place, we can\u2019t have space. Without a space, we can\u2019t have architecture...\r\nIf we want to create space, in the first instance, it has to happen in our mind. When a conceptual vision takes form in our minds, a place (with its own spatial features) is born.\r\nArchitecture 101 is an introduction to space and architecture through 101 exercises. A six-month journey divided into 3 courses \u201conline\u201d on iversity (part 1, part 2 and part 3), one final exhibition / graduation party. If you are still alive after all of this daunting process, there will be a one-week workshop \u201coffline\u201d, where we will go one step beyond.\r\nIn short:\r\nPart 1: From Nothingness to Place (Jan 5 to Feb 28, we will work in 2d) Part 2: From Place to Space (Mar 2 to Apr 25, we will work in 3d) Part 3: From Space to Architecture (Apr 27 to Jun 20, we will work in scale 1 to 1)\r\nExhibition / Graduation at Abadir, in Sicily (Jun 19 to Jun 21, we set up our fancy exhibition) Workshop: Architecture 101 Summer Camp at Abadir, in Sicily (Jun 22 to Jun 26, we build for real).\r\nArchitecture 101 (part 1: from nothingness to place)\r\nTo start our journey, we will deal with the absence of space and place. Something that could be defined as \u201cnothingness\u201d.\r\nAs Ang Lee or Paul Valery would respectively say : \u201cThe source of all the material comes from nothingness.\u201d \u201cGod made everything out of nothing, but the nothingness shows through.\u201d\r\nIn a different way, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught us that when things have no name, they don\u2019t exist. Hence in order to understand things, we have to start with worlds in which things have no name. Pieces of music without sound. Televisions without signal.\r\nWe will go through the process of shaping meaning. Articulate and complex meanings, defining relationships between mind and bodies, bodies and places. Little by little, we will encounter places and see the world taking shape.\r\nAll of this, using a \u201chands-on\u201d system (you will by doing).\r\nCourse Structure\r\nWeek 1: taking pictures Week 2: learning to sketch Week 3: making collages Week 4: observing the weather Week 5: shaping diagrams Week 6: drawing maps Week 7: passing an exam Week 8: taking a break\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nTo see places like architects do. To understand the principles upon which we convert a place into a state of mind. We will explore nothingness, void and negative space. We will learn to name things, we will learn how to invent place (as we wrote before, when things have no name, they cannot exist).\r\nWe will learn to stare, observe and see. We will learn a significative amount of extremely interesting (and totally useless) things.\r\nAll of the above refers to the conceptual part of our course. Then, since we love having our students making practical things, you will also learn lots of technical things using a number of interesting applications.\r\nAt the end, what do I make?\r\nA booklet (with a given proportion, size, appearance) where you will collect all of your visual experiments. Each booklet devoted to a specific \u201cplace\u201d. If one thousand people finish this part 1, we will have a fabulous collection of 1000 booklets.\r\nPrior Knowledge\r\nImportant thing!\r\nIn terms of prior knowledge, nothing in particular is required. However, in terms of technical equipment, this course will be easier to follow for those with access to a smartphone or tablet. We shaped this course for a very specific kind of student. Our imaginary student is a gent (or gentle lady) who accesses our content via his/her smartphone. Of course you can follow us via a desktop, make homework at home on your table. Yet, the way we intended the whole thing is for someone who takes the whole course (including doing homework) via a smartphone (or tablet).\r\nWorkload\r\nBetween 3 and 7 hours a week. From Monday to Friday, for a total of 6 weeks, you will receive an email with a 15 second-video to watch (to get you in the mood), and a pdf with some instructions for completing an assignment and a series of references (to go deeper in the subject at hand).\r\nThen, you will get to work on your assignment. Once you complete your assignment, you will upload it to the iversity platform and share it on your preferred social media account(s). Ideally Instagram.\r\nThen, during the weekend, we will give you some time to catch up.\r\nAre you ready?\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-02-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Architecture 101 - Part I: From Nothingness to Place", "price": 0, "instructors": "Petronela Nita, Anne-Sophie Gauvin and Stefano Mirti", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "3-7 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://iversity.org/en/courses/architecture-101-part-i", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["iversity"], "start_date": "2015-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
