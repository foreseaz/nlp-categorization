In Modules 1-4 we will cover the final elements of the Specialization necessary to round out this introduction to the fundamentals of Photography, and prepare you for creating your own exciting project in the Capstone!  You have come a long way since the beginning of this journey from Smartphone Basics to DSLR and Beyond!  In Course Four you will start with a survey of content in photography, from fact to fiction, documentary to purely expressive.  Next we will look at the essential element of Light, in Ambient/Natural settings and then in Controlled Continuous and Strobe situations.  We'll end the Course with an overview of methods for finalizing your pictures in print form, including simple but effective matting techniques, and in web page designs as well.  Protecting your copyrights by understanding that concept and the ways that you can assert them, being careful about blogs and other outlets, and recognizing you are part of a community that respects the individual's creative effort, well that is an important subject to end up with too!
