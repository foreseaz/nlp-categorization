New building materials and construction methods reflected changing times, and the radical contrast between tradition and modernism in the nation was clearly visible in architecture throughout Japan.\n\nAfter exploring the intense Westernization Japan experienced to rival the world\u2019s developed countries, we will turn to look at how Japanese architects developed their own version of Modernism. Initially, Japanese wanted to pursue the discoveries of the Franco-Swiss Le Corbusier and of Walter Gropius at the German Bauhaus. But soon, Japan also began to produce its own 20th-century architects and develop its own style. Following World War II, Kenzo Tange became the first Japanese architect in history to achieve international fame.\n\nLastly, we will mount an interview-based case study titled \u201cExploring Tokyo Tech\u2019s Twenty-First Century O-okayama Campus.\u201d\u00a0Tokyo Institute of Technology (aka Tokyo Tech) possesses its own unique and unbroken succession of architects and a campus consisting of their buildings. We will learn about Kazuo Shinohara, one of the most prominent Japanese designers of the second half of the 20th century, and several of his renowned disciples from Tokyo Tech.\n\nThis course aims to illustrate the present state of Japanese Modernist and postmodern building, as well as the distance covered over the past 150 years, including the 130-year history of Tokyo Tech itself. Join us on this journey through time as we examine and admire Japan\u2019s architecture to better understand Japanese history.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "ARCH101x: Modern Japanese Architecture: From Meiji Restoration to Today", "price": 0, "instructors": "Koichi Yasuda and David B.
