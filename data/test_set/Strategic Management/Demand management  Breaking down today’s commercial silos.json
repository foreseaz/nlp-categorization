While this hasn't changed, the means to achieve it has changed exponentially over the last two decades. As the customer searches for and finds your hotel, you will have to deal with the costs of distribution and how to sell through the most profitable channels to keep a healthy bottom line, while ensuring adequate visibility and top line. Revenue ManagementIn this module, we will look at what problems Revenue Management was invented to help hotels and other similar business overcome. Then we will go through each of the critical six steps of the Revenue Management Cycle answering such questions along the way as: Where do I get the data I need from? What do I do with the data once I have it? How can I predict what is going to happen in the future? What kind of forecasting method can I use? What decisions do I need to make to get the most revenue and profit?\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Demand management: Breaking down today\u2019s commercial silos", "price": 0, "instructors": "Peter O'Connor", "institution_name": ["ESSEC Business School"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/demandmanagement", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
