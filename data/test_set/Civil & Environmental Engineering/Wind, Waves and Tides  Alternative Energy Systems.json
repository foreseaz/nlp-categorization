Anyone who has lived on a coast or even vacationed there is familiar with waves and tides. That these naturally-occurring fluid flows contain energy is intuitively recognizable and indeed technologies to harvest wind and tidal energy were in use centuries ago. Our current quest for sustainable energy sources has led us to refocus once again on the potential of wind, waves and tides. This course will explain and describe the technologies to extract energy from each. The strengths and weaknesses of these various technologies will be discussed and illustrated through case studies of specific installations.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        MODULE 1 - WIND ENERGY\u2022\tPart A \u00a0Wind sources and influences (week 1)\u2022\tPart B \u00a0Fundamentals of wind energy technology (week 2)\u2022\tPart C \u00a0Predicting wind turbine output (week 3)\u2022\tPart D \u00a0Economic and environmental issues (week 4)\u2022\tPart E \u00a0Case studies (week 4)MODULE 2 \u2013 WAVE ENERGY\u2022\tPart A \u00a0Wave energy fundamentals (week 5)\u2022\tPart B \u00a0Wave energy converters (week 6)MODULE 3 \u2013 TIDAL ENERGY (week 7)\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-11-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "Wind, Waves and Tides: Alternative Energy Systems", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Wallace", "institution_name": ["University of Toronto"], "commitment": "5-7 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/windwavetide", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
