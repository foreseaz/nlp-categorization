From your smartphone to your tablet, location enabled devices are present in almost every household. With over 80% of all data having some type of spatial (or geographical) component, GIS and the principles of geographic data have relevancy everywhere. This course will introduce students to GIS and the principles of spatial data in their personal life as well as applications of GIS across various industries. Major components of the course include computer representation of geographic information, the basics of GIS databases, spatial analysis with GIS, and application areas of GIS. At the end of the course, students will have an understanding of elementary GIS theory and examples of GIS-based solutions in the world around them.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\u00a0Introduction to Geographical Information Systems (GIS)\r\nWeek 2:\u00a0Layers, Scales of Measurement, Map Design\r\nWeek 3:\u00a0Inside A GIS\r\nWeek 4:\u00a0Earth Measurements, Coordinate Systems and Projections\r\nWeek 5:\u00a0GIS Editing, Geoprocessing, and Programming\r\nWeek 6:\u00a0GIS Data and Analysis in GIS\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Geographical Information Systems (GIS)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Amber Bloechle", "institution_name": ["University of West Florida"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/uofwestflorida/courses/geographical-information-systems-1", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
