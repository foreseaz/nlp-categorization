The energy system has been continually changing, as the economy and technology progress.\n\nToday, energy systems are confronted with pressing global challenges: climate protection; economic and social development; poverty eradication; adequate food production; health for all; and the conservation of ecosystems, peace and security. A major transformation \u2013 an energy transition - is required to address these challenges.\n\nTake a multidisciplinary approach to energy transition\n\nEnergy transition, however, is not a simple question with straightforward solutions. Instead, it must consider and balance technological, legal, economic, spatial and social aspects.\n\nOn this free online course, we will take this multidisciplinary approach, to examine the energy transition question from each of these perspectives. We will provide you with the framework and methods to analyse the question yourself.\n\nWe will start by introducing global energy and sustainability issues, and possible scenarios in the first week. To facilitate and realise changes in energy systems, technology and innovation plays an important role. This will be discussed in Week 2.\n\nIn Weeks 3 and 4, we will analyse  legal and economic considerations at regional and country levels. When country-level decisions are being implemented, spatial planning and social acceptance come into the picture.\n\nIn Weeks 5 and 6, we will discuss how communities and individuals perceive energy transitions and interact with policies.\n\nAnalyse energy transition in your own country\n\nIn the final week, you will use the knowledge and skills you will have acquired from this course, to analyse the energy transition question in your own country.\n\nTo provide insightful analysis and suggest sensible solutions in your final assignment, start thinking  now about energy transition questions in your country that you want to work on. With these questions in mind, you can practise and deepen your knowledge with articles, discussions and quizzes each week.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "Solving the Energy Puzzle: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Energy Transition", "price": 0, "instructors": "Andr\u00e9 Faaij", "institution_name": ["University of Groningen"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/energy-transition?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
