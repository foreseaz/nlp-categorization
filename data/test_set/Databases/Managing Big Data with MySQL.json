You will learn how relational databases work, and how to use entity-relationship diagrams to display the structure of the data held within them.  This knowledge will help you understand how data needs to be collected in business contexts, and help you identify features you want to consider if you are involved in implementing new data collection efforts.  You will also learn how to execute the most useful query and table aggregation statements for business analysts, and practice using them with real databases. No more waiting 48 hours for someone else in the company to provide data to you \u2013 you will be able to get the data by yourself!\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of how relational databases work, and have a portfolio of queries you can show potential employers. Businesses are collecting increasing amounts of information with the hope that data will yield novel insights into how to improve businesses.

This specialization consists of four courses and a final Capstone Project, where you will apply your skills to a real-world business process. You will learn to perform sophisticated data-analysis functions using powerful software tools such as Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and MySQL. To learn more, watch the video and review the specialization overview document we provided. In the fourth course of this specialization \"Managing Big Data with MySQL\u201d you will learn how relational databases  work and how they are used in business analysis. Specifically, you will:Describe the structure of relational databasesInterpret and create entity-relationship diagrams and relational schemas that describe the contents of specific databasesWrite queries that retrieve and sort data that meet specific criteria, and retrieve such data from real MySQL and Teradata business databases that contain over 1 million rows of dataExecute practices that limit the impact of your queries on other coworkersSummarize rows of data using aggregate functions, and segment aggregations according to specified variablesCombine and manipulate data from multiple tables across a databaseRetrieve records and compute calculations that are dependent on dynamic data features, andTranslate data analysis questions into SQL queries that accommodate the types of anomalies found in real data sets. By the end of this course, you will have a clear understanding of how relational databases work and have a portfolio of queries you can show potential employers. Businesses are collecting increasing amounts of information with the hope that data will yield novel insights into how to improve businesses.  Analysts that understand how to access this data \u2013 this means you! \u2013 will have a strong competitive advantage in this data-smitten business world. To get started, please begin with the video 'About This Specialization.'I hope you enjoy this week's materials!Understanding Relational DatabasesWelcome to week 1! This week  you will learn how relational databases are organized, and practice making and interpreting Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams and relational schemas that describe the structure of data stored in a database. By the end of the week, you will be able to:Describe the fundamental principles of relational database design Interpret Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams and Entity Relationship (ER) schemas, andCreate your own ER diagrams and relational schemas using a software tool called ERDPlus that you will use to aid your query-writing later in the course.This week\u2019s exercises are donated from a well-known Database Systems textbook, and will help you deepen and strengthen your understanding of how relational databases are organized.  This deeper understanding will help you navigate complicated business databases, and allow you to write more efficient queries.  At the conclusion of the week, you will test your understanding of database design principles by completing the Week 1 graded quiz. To get started, please begin with the video \u201cProblems with Having a Lot of Data Used by a Lot of People.\u201d As always, if you have any questions, post them to the Discussions. I hope you enjoy this week's materials! Queries to Extract Data from Single Tables Welcome to week 2! This week, you will start interacting with business databases. You will write SQL queries that query data from two real companies. One data set, donated from a local start-up in Durham, North Carolina called Dognition, is a MySQL database containing tables of over 1 million rows. The other data set, donated from a national US department store chain called Dillard\u2019s, is a Teradata database containing tables with over a hundred million rows.By the end of the week, you will be able to:Use two different database user interfacesWrite queries to verify and describe all the contents of the Dognition MySQL database and the Dillard\u2019s Teradata databaseRetrieve data that meet specific criteria in a socially-responsible using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and TOP clauses, and format the data you retrieve using aliases, DISTINCT clauses, and ORDER BY clauses.Make sure to watch the instructional videos about how to use the database interfaces we have established for this course, and complete both the MySQL and the Teradata exercises. At the end of the week, you will test your understanding of the SQL syntax introduced this week by completing the Week 2 graded quiz.To get started, please begin with the video \u201cIntroduction to Week 2.\u201d  As always, if you have any questions, post them to the Discussions.I hope you enjoy this week's materials!Queries to Summarize Groups of Data from Multiple Tables Welcome to week 3! This week, we are going to learn the SQL syntax that allows you to segment your data into separate categories and segment.  We are also going to learn how to combine data stored in separate tables.By the end of the week, you will be able to:Summarize values across entire columns, and break those summaries up according to specific variables or values in others columns using GROUP BY and HAVING clausesCombine information from multiple tables using inner and outer joinsUse strategies to manage joins between tables with duplicate rows, many-to-many relationships, and atypical configurationsPractice one of the slightly more challenging use cases of aggregation functions, andWork with the Dognition database to learn more about how MySQL handles mismatched aggregation levels.Make sure to watch the videos about joins, and complete both the MySQL and the Teradata exercises. At the end of the week, you will test your understanding of the SQL syntax introduced this week by completing the Week 3 graded quiz.We strongly encourage you to use the course Discussions to help each other with questions.  To get started, please begin with the video 'Welcome to Week 3.\u2019I hope you enjoy this week\u2019s materials! Queries to Address More Detailed Business QuestionsWelcome to week 4, the final week of Managing Big Data with MySQL!  This week you will practice integrating the SQL syntax you\u2019ve learn so far into queries that address analysis questions typical of those you will complete as a business data analyst.  By the end of the week, you will be able to:Design and execute subqueriesIntroduce logical conditions into your queries using IF and CASE statementsImplement analyses that accommodate missing data or data mistakes, andWrite complex queries that incorporate many tables and clauses.By the end of this week you will feel confident claiming that you know how to write SQL queries to create business value. Due to the extensive nature of the queries we will practice this week, we have put the graded quiz that tests your understanding of the SQL strategies you will practice in its own week rather than including it in this week\u2019s materials.  Make sure to complete both the MySQL exercises and the Teradata exercises, and we strongly encourage you to use the course Discussions to help each other with questions.  To get started, please begin with the video 'Welcome to Week 4.\u2019I hope you enjoy this week\u2019s materials!Strengthen and Test Your Understanding This week contains the final ungraded Teradata exercises, and the final graded quiz for the course. The exercises are intended to hone and build your understanding of the last important concepts in the course, and lead directly to the quiz so be sure to do both!\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Managing Big Data with MySQL", "price": 0, "instructors": "Daniel Egger and Jana Schaich Borg", "institution_name": ["Duke University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
