In this course, you'll use analytical elements of SQL for answering business intelligence questions. You'll learn features of relational database management systems for managing summary data commonly used in business intelligence reporting. Because of the importance and difficulty of managing implementations of data warehouses, we'll also delve into storage architectures, scalable parallel processing, data governance, and big data impacts.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        DBMS Extensions and Example Data WarehousesModule 1 introduces the course and covers concepts that provide a context for the remainder of this course. In the first two lessons, you\u2019ll understand the objectives for the course and know what topics and assignments to expect. In the remaining lessons, you will learn about DBMS extensions, a review of schema patterns, data warehouses used in practice problems and assignments, and examples of data warehouses in education and health care. This informational module will ensure that you have the background for success in later modules that emphasize details and hands-on skills.You should also read about the software requirements in the lesson at the end of module 1. I recommend that you try to install the Oracle software this week before assignments begin in week 2. If you have taken other courses in the specialization, you may already have installed the Oracle software.SQL Subtotal OperatorsNow that you have the informational context for relational database support of data warehouses, you\u2019ll start using relational databases to write business intelligence queries! In module 2, you will learn an important extension of the SQL SELECT statement for subtotal operators. You\u2019ll apply what you\u2019ve learned in practice and graded problems using Oracle SQL for problems involving the CUBE, ROLLUP, and GROUPING SETS operators. Because the subtotal operators are part of the SQL standard, your learning will readily apply to other enterprise DBMSs. At the end of this module, you will have solid background to write queries using the SQL subtotal operators as a data warehouse analyst.SQL Analytic FunctionsAfter your experience using the SQL subtotal operators, you are ready to learn another important SQL extension for business intelligence applications. In module 3, you will learn about an extended processing model for SQL analytic functions that support common analysis in business intelligence applications. You\u2019ll apply what you\u2019ve learned in practice and graded problems using Oracle SQL for problems involving qualitative ranking of business units, window comparisons showing relationships of business units over time, and quantitative contributions showing performance thresholds and contributions of individual business units to a whole business. Because analytic functions are part of the SQL standard, your learning will apply to other enterprise DBMSs. At the end of this module, you will have solid background to write queries using the SQL analytic functions as a data warehouse analyst.Materialized View Processing and DesignAfter acquiring query formulation skills for development of business intelligence applications, you are ready to learn about DBMS extensions for efficient query execution. Business intelligence queries can use lots of resources so materialized view processing and design has become an important extension of DBMSs. In module 4, you will learn about an SQL statement for creating materialized views, processing requirements for materialized views, and rules for rewriting queries using materialized views. To gain insight about the complexity of query rewriting, you will practice rewriting queries using materialized views. To provide closure about relational database support for data warehouses, you will learn about about Oracle tools for data integration, the Oracle Data Integrator, along with two SQL statements useful for specific data integration tasks. After this module, you will have a solid background to use materialized views to improve query performance and deploy the Extraction, Loading, and Transformation approach for data integration as a data warehouse administrator or analyst.Physical Design and GovernanceModule 5 finishes the course with a return to conceptual material about physical design technologies and data governance practices. You will learn about storage architectures, scalable parallel processing, big data issues, and data governance. After this module, you will have background about conceptual issues important for data warehouse administrators.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Relational Database Support for Data Warehouses", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Mannino", "institution_name": ["University of Colorado System"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/dwrelational", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
