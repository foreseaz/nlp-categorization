It aims to build bridges between traditionally antagonistic approaches to understanding the mind.\n\nWhat is a mind?\n\nThis  question has perplexed philosophers, scientists, historians and ordinary people across time and cultures.\n\nWhile advances in the medical understanding of how the brain functions can shed light on neurological functions and disorders, the essential question of what the mind is speaks to a different problem.\n\nThis problem cannot be answered by a purely scientific understanding of the brain, nor by a purely philosophical or psychological approach. Many disciplines have attempted to address the question\u2019, resulting in multiple and sometimes antithetical answers.\n\nNew understandings of the mind\n\nOn this course, Professor Mark Solms, Chair of Neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town, will adopt a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nHe will bring in perspectives from a range of disciplines, to explore four specific aspects of the mind-  subjectivity, intentionality, consciousness and agency.  Together, these will help us think about the fundamental questions: what it is to be a mind, why we have a mind and what it feels like to have a mind.\n\nYou can find out more in Professor Mark Solms\u2019s posts for the FutureLearn blog: \u201cWhat is a mind? One of the great mysteries of our time\u201d and \u201cThinking and feeling: what\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "What Is a Mind?", "price": 0, "instructors": "Mark Solms", "institution_name": ["University of Cape Town"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/what-is-a-mind?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
