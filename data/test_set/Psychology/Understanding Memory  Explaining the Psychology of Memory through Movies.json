Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to enhance memory function, especially as we get older. Rather than covering all aspects of human memory, I will provide an introduction to the scientific study of memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold widespread popular appeal. \n\nAll of my lectures will describe what has been learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background in psychology. To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous films to illustrate different aspects of memory. Many of us love watching movies because they offer an unparalleled opportunity for entertainment, even if entertaining films are not always scientifically accurate. Still, I believe that we can learn a lot about memory from popular films, if we watch them with an educated eye. \n\nThis course is based on my new book from MIT Press - Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory. While it is not required for the course, it can enhance your understanding of memory by providing a thorough coverage of the topics that I describe as well as additional fascinating aspects of memory covered only in the book. This book is available in either hardcopy or ebook form and MIT Press is offering a 30% discount off the cover price by using discount code MMAM30 at https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/memory-and-movies.\n\nWelcome once more. I am looking forward to showing you what films can teach us about memory.\n\n*This course was previously titled \"Memory and Movies\"\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Memory Processes and Memory MoviesHuman memory involves a collection of systems that enable us to remember the past and imagine the future. Films can enhance our understanding of memory by telling us stories about people, illustrating how their present was shaped by their past and how, by watching their stories, we might navigate similar situations in our future.Making Long Lasting MemoriesMemory\u2019s main purpose is to facilitate future thinking. But to plan successful future actions, effective strategies for learning and retention are needed. Some strategies are highly effective for producing long lasting memories, others are not.Autobiographical Memories and Life StoriesEach of us has a life story based on our personal experiences. These autobiographical memories define us and make us unique. But in telling our life story, we have reconstructed a personal narrative, much like a memoir writer. These recollections are generally accurate, but our memories are never a perfect record of the past. Understanding the Reality of AmnesiaAmnesia has often been portrayed in film as resulting from a bump on the head and cured by another head bonk. In real life, amnesia can follow physical or emotional trauma, it may be temporary or permanent, and if it resolves, it is never from another blow to the head.Senior Moments, Forgetfulness, and DementiaChanges in memory can occur as we get older. Some changes are normal, whereas others might signal the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or some other form of dementia. Memory loss is worrisome, but there are effective ways to help maintain memory function as we age. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Seamon", "institution_name": ["Wesleyan University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/memory-and-movies", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
