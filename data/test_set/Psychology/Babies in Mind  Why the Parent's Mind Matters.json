This will include, for example, thinking about the parent\u2019s ability to be \u2018mind-minded\u2019 in terms of being able to treat their baby as an individual with a mind of their own.\n\nThroughout, we\u2019ll seek to answer questions such as:\n\n\n  How does a parent\u2019s mind influence the development of a baby before he or she is born?\n  What processes take place in the post-natal period that influence the baby\u2019s developing mind?\n  What can we do during pregnancy and the post-natal period to support parents who are experiencing difficulties?\n\n\nYou will get the chance to hear from expert academics and clinicians working in infant mental health, and share your views with other parents and caregivers around the world.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Babies in Mind: Why the Parent's Mind Matters", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jane Barlow", "institution_name": ["The University of Warwick"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/babies-in-mind?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
