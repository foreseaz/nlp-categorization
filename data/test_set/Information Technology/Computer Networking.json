Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.\n\nThis course covers advanced topics in Computer Networking such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Data Center Networking and Content Distribution. The course is divided into three parts:\n\nPart 1 is about the implementation, design principles and goals of a Computer Network and touches upon the various routing algorithms used in CN (such as link-state and distance vector). \n\nPart 2 talks about resource control and content distribution in Networking Applications. It covers Congestion Control and Traffic Shaping.\n\nPart 3 deals with the operations and management of computer networks encompassing SDN's (Software Defined Networks), Traffic Engineering and Network Security.Why Take This Course?Want to build on your Computer Networking knowledge or move into Network Engineering positions such as Systems Admin, Network Admin or Technical Operations (WebOps)? If so, this is the class for you.\n\nComputer Networking takes a hands-on approach to teaching very technical material, using Mininet (a network emulator) to show you how a computer network functions, what factors contribute to its efficiency and how to overcome inherent limitations.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Introduction\n\n- Computer Networking Overview\n- What This Class is Not About\n\n\n### Lesson 2: Architecture &amp; Principles\n\n-\tA Brief History of the Internet\n-\tArchitectural Design Principles\n-\tPacket Switching\n-\tFile Transfer\n-\tEnd to End Argument Violations\n\n### Lesson 3: Switching\n\n-\tSwitching and Bridging\n-\tBootstrapping: Networking Two Hosts\n-\tARP: Address Resolution Protocol\n-\tInterconnecting LANs with Hubs\n-\tSwitches: Traffic Isolation\n-\tSpanning Tree\n-\tSwitches vs. Routers\n-\tBuffer Sizing for a TCP Sender\n\n\n### Lesson 4: Routing\n\n-\tInternet Routing\n-\tIntra-AS Topology\n-\tDistance-Vector Routing\n-\tLink State Routing\n-\tInterdomain Routing\n-\tIGP vs. iBGP\n-\tBGP Route Selection\n-\tMultiple Exit Discriminator (MEI)\n-\tInterdomain Routing Business Models\n\n\n### Lesson 5: Naming, Addressing &amp; Forwarding\n\n-\tIP Addressing\n-\tPre-1994: \u201cClassful\u201d Addressing\n-\tIP Address Allocation\n-\tClassless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)\n-\tMultihoming Frustrates Aggregation\n-\tAddress Lookup Using Tries\n-\tMemory Efficiency and Fast Lookup\n-\tAlternatives to LPM with Tries\n-\tNAT and IPv6\n-\tNetwork Address Translation (NAT)\n\n### Lesson 5.1: Router Design Basics\n\n-\tRouter Design\n-\tBasic Router Architecture\n-\tDecision: Crossbar Switching\n-\tSwitching Algorithm: Maximal Matching\n-\tHead of Line Blocking\n-\tScheduling and Fairness\n-\tMax-Min Fairness\n\n### Lesson 5.2: Domain Name System (DNS)\n\n-\tRecord Types\n-\tExamples (using \u201cdig\u201d)\n-\tLookup IP Address\n\n### Lesson 6: Congestion Control &amp; Streaming\n\n-\tCongestion Control\n-\tAIMD (TCP Congestion Control)\n-\tData Centers &amp; TCP \u201cIncast\u201d\n-\tBarrier Synchronization &amp; Idle Time\n-\tMultimedia &amp; Streaming\n-\tDigitizing Audio &amp; Video\n-\tStreaming Video\n-\tSkype\n\n\n### Lesson 7: Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping\n\n-\tTraffic Classification &amp; Shaping\n-\tSource Classification \n-\tLeaky Bucket Traffic Shaping\n-\t(r, t) Traffic Shaping\n-\tShaping Bursty Traffic Patterns\n-\tPower Boost\n-\tEffects on Latency\n-\tBuffer Bloat\n-\tPacket Monitoring\n\n### Lesson 8: Content Distribution\n\n-\tThe Web and Caching\n-\tHTTP Requests\n-\tPersistent Connections\n-\tContent Distribution Networks (CDNs)\n-\tServer Selection\n-\tContent Routing\n-\tBit Torrent\n-\tSolution to Freeriding: \u201cChoking\u201d\n-\tDistributed Hash Tables\n-\tConsistent Hashing\n\n### Lesson 9: Software Defined Networking\n\n-\tNetwork Management Overview\n-\tSoftware Defined Networking (SDN)\n-\tControl and Data Planes\n-\tDifferent SDN Controllers\n-\tNOX: Overview\n-\tRyu, Floodlight, Nox and Pox\n-\tCustomizing Control\n\n### Lesson 10: Traffic Engineering\n\n-\tTraffic Engineering Overview\n-\tInterdomain Traffic Engineering\n-\tMeasuring, Modeling and Controlling Traffic\n-\tLink Utilization Function\n-\tBGP in Interdomain Traffic Engineering\n-\tMultipath Routing\n-\tData Center Networking\n-\tValiant Load Balance\n-\tJellyfish Data Center Topology\n\n### Lesson 11: Network Security\n\n-\tInternet is Insecure\n-\tResource Exhaustion \n-\tRouting Security\n-\tOrigin and Path Authentication\n-\tDNS Security\n-\tDNS Cache Poisoning\n\n### Lesson 11.1: Internet Worms\n\n-\tViruses and Internet Worms\n-\tInternet Worm Lifecyle\n-\tFirst Worm: \u201cMorris\u201d Worm\n-\tWorm Outbreaks in Detail \n-\tModeling Fast-Spreading Worms\n\n### Lesson 11.2: Spam\n\n-\tSpam\n-\tIP Blacklisting\n\n### Lesson 11.3: Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks\n\n-\tTCP 3-Way Handshake\n-\tInferring Denial of Service Activity using Backscatter\n-\tAutomated DoS Attack Mitigation\n-\tMTPCP\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-10-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Computer Networking", "price": 0, "instructors": "Nick Feamster", "institution_name": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/ud436", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2014-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
