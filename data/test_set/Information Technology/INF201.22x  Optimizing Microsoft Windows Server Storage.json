Once you have initially configured your Microsoft Windows Server storage you will want to take advantage of three key features: iSCSI Storage, Storage Spaces and Data Deduplication.\n\niSCSI is a protocol that supports remote access to SCSI-based storage devices over a TCP/IP network. It provides and easy to use alternative to Storage Area Networks (SANs) and can use existing infrastructure.\n\nStorage Spaces lets you group physical disks together and present them as a single logical disk. This makes it easy to manage and dynamically allocate storage.\n\nData Deduplication is a service that identifies and removes duplications within data. The goal of Data Deduplication is to maximize the use of disk space.\n\nThis course follows INF201.21, Implementing Microsoft Windows Server Disks and Volumes but it is not required.\n\nGo beyond simple storage strategies and take control of your organization\u2019s storage needs!\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-01-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "INF201.22x: Optimizing Microsoft Windows Server Storage", "price": 0, "instructors": "Cynthia Staley and Marcin Policht", "institution_name": ["Microsoft"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/optimizing-microsoft-windows-server-microsoft-inf201-22x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
