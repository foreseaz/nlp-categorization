We will discuss common data structures, including ExpressionSets, SummarizedExperiment and GRanges used across several types of analyses.Week TwoIn this week we will learn how to represent and compute on biological sequences, both at the whole-genome level and at the level of millions of short reads.Week Three In this week we will cover Basic Data Types, ExpressionSet, biomaRt, and R S4.Week FourIn this week, we will cover Getting data in Bioconductor, Rsamtools, oligo, limma, and minfi\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kasper Hansen", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioconductor", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
