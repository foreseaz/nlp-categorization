We will explain how to start with raw data, and perform the standard processing and normalization steps to get to the point where one can investigate relevant biological questions. Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment.\n\nWe will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples.\n\nThis class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.\n\nThis course is part of a larger set of 8 total courses running Self-Paced through September 15th, 2015:PH525.1x:\u00a0Statistics and R for the Life Sciences\n\nPH525.2x:\u00a0Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra\n\nPH525.3x:\u00a0Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences\n\nPH525.4x:\u00a0Introduction to Bioconductor\n\nPH525.5x:\u00a0Case study: RNA-seq data analysis\n\nPH525.6x: Case study: Variant Discovery and Genotyping\n\nPH525.7x:\u00a0Case study: ChIP-seq data analysis\n\nPH525.8x:\u00a0Case study: DNA methylation data analysis\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.
