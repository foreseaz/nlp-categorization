We will see that dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic tool when we compare two genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or two proteins. When we \"zoom out\" to compare entire genomes, we will employ combinatorial algorithms.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 How Do We Compare Biological Sequences?
