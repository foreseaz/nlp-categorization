But what makes a good learning game? Where do ideas come from and how do you create them? These are the questions that this course tries to answer.\n\nThe premise of learning games from some perspectives seems like a perfect and easy solution - get people to learn things they don\u2019t want to by motivating them through game play. To others it seems like an oxymoron - if learning is hard then it can\u2019t possibly be fun at the same time. The key to designing good learning games is to reconcile these perspectives by creating games that focus on creating environments based on \u201chard fun.\u201d This idea will be a central tenet of this course.\n\nThrough six units comprising nine weeks, we will look at the evolution of educational video games and hear from experts working on many aspects of learning games from design to development to implementation. For the course project, participants will create their own learning game. This course utilizes Gameblox, a game editor that uses a block based programming language to allow anyone to create games.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "11.127x: Design and Development of Games for Learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Paul Medlock-Walton, Jason Haas and Eric Klopfer", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "6-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/design-development-games-learning-mitx-11-127x-0", "duration": "9 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
