Global health is a relatively new field and there is currently some debate over its definition.Emerging Trends in Global Health: Infectious DiseasesThere are 7 parts to module 3. Lessons 3 &amp; 4 are both introductory sections that describe key concepts necessary to understand infectious diseases and how we deal with them. Lesson 5 constitutes the core lesson of module 3. This lesson focuses on the current global situation and future challenges for the most prominent infectious diseases of the world. In lessons 6-9 we discuss neglected tropical diseases, re-emerging infectious diseases and epidemics/pandemics. Finally, lesson 10 and 10b summarize module 3 in a set of key conclusions.Emerging Trends in Global Health: Non-Communicable Diseases and DisabilityIn this module we consider the rise of non-communicable (NCDs) diseases across countries, along with  mental  disorders  and  disability.  Governance for Global Health, Health Systems and FinancingThis module is concerned  with the global health system (which refers to responses  to health conditions  or the prevention  of these)  and the management  of this system  through  global health governance.Foreign Policy, Trade and HealthHealth policy has undergone profound changes during the last few decades. Although health has for a long time been an issue in international relations, it was for most of the 20th century perceived  as a national  and technical  matter. This meant that solutions  to health problems were seen to require primarily scientific and technological collaboration rather than political commitment. Along with the dramatic  changes  associated with globalisation,  health is increasingly  seen as a higher priority on international  political agendas. \nIn Module 6, we discuss what triggered this political \u2018revolution\u2019 and  its  implications.Research, Development, Innovation and Technology for Global HealthThis module addresses the lack of attention to research and development for medicines and technologies for diseases that disproportionately affect developing  countries and all the issues related to drug development and intellectual property rights.The Environment, Sustainable Development and HealthIn this module we consider the relationship between the environment, sustainable development and health.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Global Health: An Interdisciplinary Overview", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["University of Geneva"], "commitment": "6-7 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-health-overview", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
