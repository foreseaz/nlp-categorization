Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed or predicted with traditional statistical methods. Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change. Systems thinking and systems models devise strategies to account for real world complexities.\n\n\nThis work was coordinated by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, the World Health Organization, with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

System Conceptualization Using Causal Loop DiagramsThis module will introduce you to the concepts of causal loop diagrams and how they can be used in participatory research. You will also be introduced to the software Vensim that allows you to draw causal loop diagrams.System Dynamics Simulation Using Stock-and-Flow DiagramsThis module will introduce you to the concepts of systems dynamics modeling and will show you how to use Vensim to run a pre-existing system dynamics model.Practical and policy implicationsThis Module wraps up the course and shows you how systems thinking can contribute to policy making.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Systems Thinking In Public Health", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ligia Paina, PhD and David Bishai, MD, PhD", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/systems-thinking", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
