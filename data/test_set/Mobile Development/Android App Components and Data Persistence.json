You will learn by example how to program these core Android components together with basic Java file I/O classes (such as File, InputStream, OutputWriter, etc.) and Android storage mechanisms (such as Shared Preferences).  Throughout this MOOC you'll work incrementally on a project involving a simple multi-activity game that requires data persistence. Each week you will add additional capabilities to the project, based on material covered in the lecture videos. You'll spend roughly 4 hours per week watching video lectures, taking quizzes, and programming assignments with Java and Android.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Android App Components and Data Persistence", "price": 0, "instructors": "Douglas Schmidt, Michael Walker and C.
