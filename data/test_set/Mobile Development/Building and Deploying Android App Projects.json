Students will work incrementally on a hands-on project involving a simple Material Design-based music streaming app throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week they will add additional capabilities to it, based on the material covered in that week\u2019s lecture videos.\n\nThere will be roughly 3-4 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments. The ordering of the modules below is designed to be flexible.  In particular, students can watch the videos in whatever order suits their experience and needs, e.g., they may want to watch the  Material Design videos prior to the advanced Android Studio videos if they prefer to learn about Material Design first.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Building and Deploying Android App Projects", "price": 0, "instructors": "Douglas Schmidt, C.
