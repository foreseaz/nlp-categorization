Cloud systems allow employees to remain connected and the latest data available and accessible at all times. Each business and role has unique needs and to ensure your mobile employees have a simplified user experience, SAP has introduced SAP Fiori so you can easily build personalized and simplified interfaces for your users.\r\nNow more than ever, developers need the right platform to quickly extend, build and run cloud business applications. SAP HANA Cloud Platform is the Platform-as-a-Service built to meet the needs of modern developers. With comprehensive services and capabilities, the world's best developers depend on SAP HANA Cloud Platform to build better apps in less time.\r\nThis course is aimed at developers interested in creating mobile apps with mobile features such as push notifications, lifecycle management, application security, offline use, and much more. The course will demonstrate how to quickly build, extend, integrate, and mobilize SAP Fiori Apps. Although the course will focus on extending SAP Fiori apps into mobile apps, the techniques used can be applied to native apps for both Android and iOS.\r\nTaking part in the hands-on exercises is optional but before the course begins, from October 13 we will show you how to create your trial accounts and prepare your system. To successfully set up your system, you will need admin rights.
