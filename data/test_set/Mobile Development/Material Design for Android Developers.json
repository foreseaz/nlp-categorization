We'll start by walking you through Android design fundamentals, then we'll show you how to apply this knowledge to transform design elements of sample apps. By the end of the course, you'll understand how to create and use material design elements, surfaces, transitions and graphics in your app, across multiple form factors.Why Take This Course?What makes an app intuitive or easy to use? What makes it hard or frustrating?  Learning the foundations of good design and platform-specific design patterns will help you create better apps for your users.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Android Design Fundamentals\nUnderstand and apply the fundamentals of Android design to your app, and experiment with app structures, common navigation patterns and themes. \n\n### Lesson 2: Surfaces\nUnderstand how to use surfaces to structure the hierarchy and interaction of elements in an app.\n\n\n### Lesson 3: Bold Graphic Design\nUnderstand and apply branding guidelines -- including key lines, metrics, fonts, typographic scale, color palette and themes/styles.  \n\n### Lesson 4: Meaningful Motion\nUnderstand the use of motion in apps, how to use transitions to change app states and properly choreograph the motion in an app. \n\n### Lesson 5: Adaptive Design\nUnderstand how to refine and test your designs on for use on multiple form factors.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Material Design for Android Developers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Roman Nurik, Nick Butcher and James Williams", "institution_name": ["Google"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
