By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to perform exploratory tests, run profiling tools, use outputs to navigate to problematic code, and design a plan of attack to mitigate poor performance. You\u2019ll also gain a higher level of understanding about how program code and the Android platform interact, which will help you optimize for performance in the future.Why Take This Course?Users want apps that download and run fast and efficiently. If your app performs well on low-end devices and slower internet connections, your user base, and thus your impact and potential for monetization, can increase dramatically. The ability to make conscious coding decisions that focus on the user experience is a trait that separates mediocre Android programmers from the leaders of the industry.  \n\nYou may have the most exciting Android app in the world, but if it is slow and drains the battery, users will uninstall it, and leave you bad ratings because of it. Performance matters to users, so it must matter to you. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will understand how common performance problems arise from your hardware, OS, and application code. Using profiling tools to gather data, you will be able to identify and fix performance bottlenecks, so users can have that smooth 60 FPS experience that will keep them coming back for more.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 0: Welcome!\nAn introduction to the course content and structure.\n### Lesson 1: Render\nHow to identify and diagnose the key performance problems that come with drawing to the screen. \n### Lesson 2: Compute and Memory\nUnderstand how code is executed in your program, and how to handle the performance problems associated with compute and memory. \n### Lesson 3: Battery\nHow to detect and diagnose battery problems, and why it matters to your users.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "Android Performance", "price": 0, "instructors": "Colt McAnlis", "institution_name": ["Google"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/android-performance--ud825?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
