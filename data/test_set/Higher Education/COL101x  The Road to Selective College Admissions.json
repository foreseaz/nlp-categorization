Students will become well versed in the language of college admissions and participate in exercises aiming to broaden their access to available resources. At the end of this course, students will understand how to research schools as they build a list of colleges of interest. We will provide tools to help students plan their high school summers, and begin considering financing a college education. Students will learn how to build a support network and given tips on how to be successful in college once they matriculate. Most importantly, students will be led through the application itself, focusing on standardized testing, essays, and extracurricular activities.\n\nThe college counselors at St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal School bring a wealth of experience to the college admission process.
