What are the possibilities for you, as a student, and for the institution to be involved in the organisation of a university? How do you behave professionally involved in the organisation of a higher education institution? How do you represent the interests of peers in a meeting of a governing body? This free online course will cover these and many more questions.\n\nIn Week 1, we will start with why it is beneficial - for the students as well as for the institution - to involve students in the organisation of higher education institutions. After that, we will explore the notion of professional behaviour and how to act professionally by presenting a practical framework developed by the student assistants of our university.\n\nStudent assistants are often involved in teaching and learning activities. Therefore, Week 2 will cover the basic design principles of good education and Week 3 will focus on how to prepare yourself for standing in front of a class. Topics that will be covered are, among others, the building blocks of a course, classroom management, motivating students, and interactive teaching and learning activities.\n\nIn Week 4, communication will be central. Giving feedback, mentoring first year students and participating in the governing bodies of the university are the main topics that will be covered.\n\nWeek 5 will contain seven case studies to be solved in order to assess the knowledge gained from the first four weeks. The case studies are based on real situations and departments within the University of Groningen. Examples of the case studies are: behaving professionally when invigilating at digital exams as a student assistant; and dealing with a disruptive classroom.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\nBehave professionally in a higher education working environment,\nGive a well-founded opinion of what is a good university teacher and mentor,\nIdentify the basic principles for designing a course,\nSpecify the aspects of how to teach a small group session in an interactive way while paying attention to classroom management and atmosphere,\nRecognise constructive written feedback on assignments,\nProvide adequate support to staff and students in a higher education environment,\nRecognise challenges of students participating in governing bodies. \n\n\nShare your stories with us on Instagram or Twitter using #FLstudentshe\n\nFind us on YouTube and Facebook.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Becoming a Student Assistant: Teaching and Mentoring", "price": 0, "instructors": "Robbert van Veen, Klaas van Veen and Ine Noben", "institution_name": ["University of Groningen"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/students-higher-education?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
