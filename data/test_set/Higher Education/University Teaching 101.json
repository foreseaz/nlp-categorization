In recent years, however, it has become apparent that teaching is not an intuitive behavior. In addition to content, teaching also involves a complex intellectual process, and to develop the \u201cart\u201d of teaching, professors require guidance and support. As the roles and responsibilities of university-level educators have evolved and expanded in recent years, the preparation of emerging university\u00a0faculty leaders must focus on the development of the knowledge, skills, and strategies for teaching and learning in higher education. This short course is designed to introduce the strategies and exemplars of university teaching skills necessary to meet these new professional demands for teaching at a university level. \u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: The Science of Teaching and LearningExploration of the science of teaching and learning, the role of neuroscience in teaching and learning, how to respond to learner differences, and technology and support for next generation learning.Teaching with the Science of LearningNeuro-Education: The Role of Neuroscience in Teaching and LearningUnderstanding Learners and Responding to their DifferencesTechnology and Support for Next Generation LearningThe Science of Learning at Work in PracticeWeek 2: Principles of Best Practices in EducationExamination of evidence-based teaching as well as strategies and approaches for integrating the principles of best practices.
