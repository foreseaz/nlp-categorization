This novel is remarkable for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Shelley wrote the novel when she was only 18 years old.Frankenstein\u00a0is a representation of both the Gothic and Romantic movements, and is often considered to be one of the earliest novels of science fiction as well. This story has had a huge influence on literature and popular culture, and has generated many adaptations in the forms of movies and plays.\u00a0 The first film adaptation, in fact, appeared in 1910.\nParticipants in this course will read, discuss, and write about the text and its influence. As in most book clubs, the focus will be on lively discussion. Course materials will include background information for understanding the text, as well as vocabulary and language support. Assessment will include quizzes and short writing assignments.\n\u00a0\nThis is the third part of the BerkeleyX Book Club offerings.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "ColWri3.3x: \"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus\" by Shelley: BerkeleyX Book Club", "price": 0, "instructors": "Maggie Sokolik", "institution_name": ["University of California, Berkeley"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/frankenstein-or-modern-prometheus-uc-berkeleyx-colwri3-3x-0", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
