The first of five modules on The Ancient Greek Hero, \u201cEpic and Lyric\u201d looks at ancient Greek heroes from the perspective of two different but related media of poetry and songmaking, epic and lyric. The major focus is Achilles, especially as viewed through the lens of the Homeric Iliad and through the \u201crose-colored glasses\u201d of Sappho\u2019s songs. While the epic of the Iliad is typical of verbal art that is performed by and for men, the lyric songs of Sappho derive from traditions of singing performed mainly by women of all ages, including adolescents about to be initiated into womanhood. These \u201cwomen\u2019s traditions\u201d are best known for two kinds of singing, laments and love songs, which are interchangeable in contexts that will surprise the modern mind. Another surprise, as we will see, is that the Iliad too contains embedded \u201cquotations\u201d of such laments and love songs, and that our first impression of this epic as a \u201cmen\u2019s tradition\u201d obscures the fact that Homeric poetry channels the songs of women as well as men. A perfect expression of such \u201cchanneling\u201d is the figure of Achilles himself, who was admired by Greek song culture as a virtuoso singer of laments and love songs in his own right. An analysis of Homeric passages that \u201cquote\u201d the singing of Achilles will be an integral part of our overall experience in close reading.\n\nSee other courses in this series:Module 2, \u201cHours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography\u201dModule 3, \u201cHours 12-15: Cult of Heroes\u201dModule 4, \u201cHours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy\u201dModule 5, \u201cHours 22-24: Plato and Beyond\u201d\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.
