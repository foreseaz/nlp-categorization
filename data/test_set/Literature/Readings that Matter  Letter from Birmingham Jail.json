This series is adapted from a set of readings that Acumen\u2019s Fellows and staff discuss\u00a0on a regular basis as part of our leadership training and development.\r\n\u201cINJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE\u2026\u201d\r\nWe have chosen to start with Martin Luther King\u2019s most widely-read text \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d because the\u00a0themes are particularly\u00a0relevant today. As we\u00a0become more interconnected as a world, we see a growing sense of otherness and awareness of injustices. This is true in the United States and across the world. Through a systematic reading and discussion of Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d\u00a0with a group of people you know, you will explore his arguments, dissect his masterful use of rhetoric, and we hope, come to a better understanding of where you stand on the various ideas he\u00a0shares.\r\nYOU'LL LOVE THIS COURSE IF\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re a leader or aspiring leader looking to learn from a master of moral imagination with the humility to see the world as it is and the audacity to imagine what it could be.\r\nYou\u2019re looking to learn powerful techniques to confront injustice and speak truth to power.\r\nYou enjoy discussing issues of justice, leadership, and the systems in which we live.\r\n\r\nHOW THE COURSE WORKS\r\nThis 1-module course is probably more akin to a\u00a0book club.\u00a0 Its power comes from the group\u2019s experience of the reading and discussion.\r\n\r\nGet a group of people together.\u00a0 We recommend starting with 3-5 people you know \u2013 your friends, family, classmates, or colleagues.\r\nHave each person you invite sign up individually\u00a0here\u00a0to receive the reading.\r\nYour group session will work best if someone takes the lead as a facilitator.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made this easy by providing a full facilitator\u2019s guide (including email templates to invite your friends) which will be emailed to you upon registration.\r\nSet a date to meet in-person (recommended) or online.\r\n\r\nTo start, we suggest setting aside 1 hour to read the letter and then 2 hours for your group\u2019s discussion.\u00a0 From our past experience, it is quite likely that your group will not get through the full reading in that time.\u00a0 Because of this we have made the course materials available on demand so that you don\u2019t have to complete them in one sitting.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Readings that Matter: Letter from Birmingham Jail", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://plusacumen.org/courses/readings-matter-martin-luther-kings-letter-birmingham-jail/", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
