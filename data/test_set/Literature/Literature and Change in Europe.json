The emphasis on intermediality aims to provide students with innovative tools for understanding changing paradigms in postmodernity. We will focus on the interplay between literature, oral, and visual culture, as well as key concepts in cultural and textual analysis, such as literacy, fictionality, transmediality, popular culture, hybridity, and creolisation. Finally, the context against which we will place these concepts is Europe, by challenging classical conceptions of Europe as a geographical, homogeneous entity and epistemological framework, we will propose a more fluid concept that positions Europe as a changing matrix of cultural, political, and economical values where post-colonial migrations and globalisation are quickly reconfiguring its old, hegemonic position on the global map.\r\n\r\nThe course consists of seven modules each focusing on a different topic and taught by a different university with faculty interaction and feedback provided.
