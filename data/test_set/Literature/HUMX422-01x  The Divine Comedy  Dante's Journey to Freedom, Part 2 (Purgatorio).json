Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a \u201cschool of contemplation,\u201d where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one\u2019s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante\u2019s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a \u201cwhole person\u201d more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante\u2019s\u00a0Purgatorio.\n\nFor us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the\u00a0Purgatorio\u00a0is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante\u2019s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.\n\nIn this course, you will be asked to participate in learning\u00a0activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep\u00a0reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits\u00a0as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical\u00a0approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the\u00a0poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about\u00a0the meaning of the poem at a personal level.\u00a0This module is the second of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the\u00a0Vita Nuova and Inferno\u00a0will launch on October 15, 2014, and the concluding module on\u00a0Paradiso\u00a0will launch in April 2015. This course features Robert and Jean Hollander's contemporary translations of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, permission courtesy of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Random House LLC.
