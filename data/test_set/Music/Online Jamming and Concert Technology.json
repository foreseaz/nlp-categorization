Under the right conditions, the Internet can be used for ultra-low-latency, uncompressed sound transmission. The course teaches open-source (free) techniques for setting up city-to-city studio-to-studio audio links. Distributed rehearsing, production and split ensemble concerts are the goal. Setting up such links and debugging them requires knowledge of network protocols, network audio issues and some ear training.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1:\u00a0Basics And Setup\u00a0Basics: Network protocols, audio signals + soundcards and network audio.\r\nSession 2:\u00a0Jacktrip Application + Connection\u00a0Things that go wrong with Jacktrip: Network &amp; Audio.
