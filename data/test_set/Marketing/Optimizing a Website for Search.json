As you may remember from Module 4 within the last course, Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals, keywords are an extremely important tool for helping your customers find you in an often crowded field. Effective use of keywords on your optimized website can result in free targeted traffic to your site, helping you to reach your business goals. In this module, you will use the keyword research you conducted in the last course and you will learn a process for selecting the best keywords to optimize your website in search results. We will look at concepts like relevancy to the site, keyword intent, how competitive the keyword is in organic search, and how well that term might convert once it receives traffic. We\u2019ll also discuss how to identify and evaluate competitors, how to map keywords to pages, and how to create a keyword map for your clients and your own site.  There is a lot to discuss in our first module, so if you are taking this course without learning the materials of module 4 within the SEO Fundamentals course, I highly recommend you complete that module before diving into this one. So, let\u2019s get started learning how to apply keyword research!Advanced On-Page SEOWelcome to week 2! While keywords help users locate relevant web pages, it\u2019s the content itself that determines whether  a click converts to a sale or increased site traffic. In many corners of the SEO world, the expression \u201cContent is King\u201d is a generally accepted rule, and in this module we\u2019ll examine content from many perspectives: how to analyze it, organize it, create it, make it great and build it into our strategies. You\u2019ll also learn how to conduct effective competitive content analysis and internal content audits. And finally, you\u2019ll learn how to create a site-wide content strategy building on the data we uncover in our study and analysis of content. Local SEOWelcome to week 3! In the lessons that follow, you will take a close look at local SEO strategy. You will see how to optimize your Google business pages, on-site content and external references such as citations, backlinks, and reviews to help your local business have higher visibility in the local search landscape. By the end of this module, you should be able to not only describe a bit of the history of how Google displays local searches but also utilize best practices to develop a high quality local SEO approach.
