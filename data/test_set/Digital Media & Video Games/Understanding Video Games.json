These games are defined by, and define our modern culture. In this course, students will learn how to study games and engage in informed discussions about them. Ultimately, this course is about understanding the literacy of video games.Understanding Video Games was created with the help of world\u00a0renowned video game developer,\u00a0BioWare\u00a0Corp, located in Edmonton, Alberta.The three main parts of the course are: 1) developing the terminology that enables us to talk about video games; 2) exploring how these terms are used in theoretical frameworks to interpret games, and; 3) turning these theories toward cultural aspects of games in order to understand how the medium has impacted society. One of the most important insights students will gain from the course will be an understanding of the interplay between video game designers, players and the games themselves.Course material is delivered in a student-friendly short-form fashion, with numerous formative feedback sections. Students will gain access to a number of special interactive modules designed specifically for this course. These modules will give users the opportunity to design their own video game avatar, as well as explore the short but fascinating history of video game releases. This course's unique lesson delivery, combined with classic quiz structure, will enable students to quickly gain a solid foundational understanding of video games within the context of modern culture.\u00a0UAlberta students can earn course credit: Learn how.For information on how non-UAlberta students can earn course credit, please see the FAQs below on this page.Understanding Video Games is part of an ongoing program of research into digital learning conducted by the University of Alberta and therefore anonymized data provided by Coursera and survey information can be made accessible to the researchers.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1: IntroductionIn this short lesson, students will learn what to expect from the course, and will be introduced to our avatar creation module.Lesson 2: Play and GamesHere, students will gain an appreciation for the differences between play and games.
