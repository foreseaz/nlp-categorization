The course then surveys the current production in the field of generative art across creative practices such as: poetry, literature, and narrative, music, visual art, moving images, video, performance art, dance, theatre, circus, design architecture, games, robotics, web and bio-art. In doing so, we also introduce the various algorithmic approaches, software, and hardware tools being used in the field. Finally, the course addresses relevant philosophical\u00a0and societal debates issues associated with the field.\u00a0\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \u00a0Session 1: Introduction and Ontology of Generative Art (February 1, 2016)In this session, we define generative art and computational creativity and establish a typology of generative systems based on levels of autonomy and agency.Session 2: History of Generative Art (from pre-history to the 80s) (February 2, 2016)Generative art is nothing new, and this session goes through the history of the field from pre-history to the 80sSession 3: Generative Art and Text (February 2, 2016)This session focuses on generative processes deployed in literature, poetry and other written forms.Session 4: Generative Music (February 2, 2016)In this session, algorithms used for the generation of both notated and interpreted music are reviewed.Session 5: Generative Visual Art, Video, and Film (February 2, 2016)This session explores the various processes deployed to date in the field of static and moving images.Session 6: Generative Sculpture, Design, and Architecture (February 2, 2016)3D and tangible realizations based on generative systems are reviewed in this session.Session 7: Generative Art and Performance, Dance, Theatre, and Circus (February 2, 2016)This session is exploring the various uses of generative systems in performative disciplines.Session 8: Generative Art and Games (February 2, 2016)This session reviews how generative algorithms are used in video games from procedural level generation to computational narratives and automatic character design.Session 9: Generative Art, Robotics, bio-Art and Web Art (February 2, 2016)This session introduces generative systems deployed in disciplines that did not exist before the computerization of our societies, such as robotics, Web Art, Virtual Reality, biotech-based art.Session 10: Computer-assisted Creativity (February 2, 2016)This session, defines the main concepts and approaches used in systems that are designed to collaborate with humans in their creative tasks.Session 11: Valuation and Evaluation of Generative Art (February 2, 2016)In this session, we explore the methodologies that can be used to evaluate how successful a given generative system is. Can a generative system be as good, or sometimes better than humans at their specific task?Session 12: Generative Art, Authorship and Societal Perspectives (February 2, 2016)This session concludes the course by deepening our understanding of the possible applications and implications of generative art. We address ethical, and philosophical concerns that can be raised by generative systems. What does developing or using a generative system means in terms of authorship and creativity\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-24T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Generative Arts and Computational Creativity", "price": 0, "instructors": "Philippe Pasquier", "institution_name": ["Simon Fraser University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-generative-arts-and-computational-creativity/info", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Kadenze"], "start_date": "2016-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
