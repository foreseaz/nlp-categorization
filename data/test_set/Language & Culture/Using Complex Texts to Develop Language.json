The purpose of the course is to support teachers to enhance students' language development by analyzing complex texts and using language from those texts, the major practices emphasized in the current college- and career-ready standards. The course will have 4 different sessions addressing the following: 1) what makes a text complex; 2) effective strategies for teaching students to analyze textual features; 3) effective strategies for teaching students to use and acquire textual language; and 4) designing lessons that emphasize students using textual language and analyzing textual features.Throughout the course, participants will complete 4 assignments that require them to collect samples of student language as it relates to the analysis and discussion of complex texts. It also organizes a massive collaboration of educators who wish to support students, particularly English Language Learners, in developing their abilities to use complex language.We hope you will join us on this exciting journey.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-01-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Using Complex Texts to Develop Language", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sara Rutherford-Quach and Belinda Louie", "institution_name": ["Stanford University", "University of Washington"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/language-complex-texts", "duration": "14 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2015-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
