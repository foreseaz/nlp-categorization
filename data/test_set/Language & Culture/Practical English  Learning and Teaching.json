Along with that, it illustrates the employed scheme and methodology of teaching in full view of the participants. As such, a sincere follower of this course will not only develop a good command over English in all its operational aspects, but also acquire the technique of teaching it to others.In order to achieve this with adult learners within a limited span of time, the scheme makes use of the medium of a so called Common Local Language (CLL) which is presumably familiar to its target audience. In this particular instance, Hindi has been taken as the CLL and the participants will be expected to have a basic operational aptitude in Hindi. [After collecting the feedback on this, partner groups will be sought to develop other versions of the course with Kannada, Tamil, Bengali etc as CLL on the basis of the same core material, which is independent of the medium language.]\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-08-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Practical English: Learning and Teaching", "price": 0, "instructors": "Bhaskar Dasgupta", "institution_name": ["IIT (Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur)"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_hs12/preview", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2015-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
