{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Web Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    In this course, you will use computers to creatively design web pages using HTML and CSS.  You will then use Javascript to develop programs and algorithms--ways to get the computer to solve problems.  As you progress, you will master the programming process that will be used through the remainder of the courses in this Specialization.\n\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\n1. Make a web page with HTML and CSS;\n2. Explain the high-level process of developing a program;\n3. Think critically about how to solve a problem;\n4. Solve programming problems with Javascript, including if/else and looping constructs; \n5. Use Javascript to manipulate images and process data; and\n6. Recognize debugging as an application of the scientific method.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will complete a mini-project where you will use Javascript to create your own images algorithmically and a website you have built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to the CourseWelcome! In this module, you will be introduced to computer science and to the organization for this course. At the end of the module, you will have a chance to gauge your incoming knowledge of some of the concepts that will be presented in this course. If you struggle to answer any of the questions in this quiz, that's good! That means this course will be a good fit for you, where you will learn these answers and more!What Is a Web Page?The final project for this course is building your own web page. In this module, you will gain a better understanding of what a web page is, how it works, and other key elements of the digital world like web servers, browsers, internet protocols, and more. In addition, this module will introduce you to the power of collaboration in designing web content as well as help you consider what makes a good user experience. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) define what a web page is, as well as key components of the digital world like web servers, browsers, and internet protocols; and (2) explain key details about the Internet, its history, and how it works.Building a Web Page with HTMLIn this module, you will gain your first tool for building web pages: HyperText Markup Language (HTML). With HTML, you will be able to structure text in a web page as well as add tables, insert links, and show images. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) access and use CodePen, the tool you will use for building websites in this course; (2) design the basic structure for a webpage using HyperText Markup Language or HTML (ordered and unordered lists, tables, headings, links, inserted images); and (3) describe some of the ethical issues surrounding the sharing of digital content.CSS for Styling a Web PageAs you use HTML to structure and add content your web page, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will help visually bring your web pages to life! You will learn in this module how to use CSS to customize the colors, fonts, and overall look of your web pages. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) explain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they are used in modern webpages in conjunction with HTML; (2) use CSS to make changes to the style of your webpage content, including changes to color and font; and (3) use any color you want for an element in a web page you create: whether it has a standard name, or you need to specify it by number.Learning to Program in JavaScriptWhen designing a web page or creating something else with computers, there are often recurring tasks that would be very time consuming to do manually. Solving these challenges programmatically, that is, by writing a program that tells your computer how to do the task, is often more efficient. In this module, you will learn the basics of your first programming language (JavaScript) as well as essential programming tools: conditional statements, loops, variables, functions, and more. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) identify situations where a program is needed for tasks that are not possible to complete manually; (2) program in JavaScript using conditional statements, loops, variables, and functions; (3) use vocabulary related to creating and editing digital images; and (4) edit images by writing and running a pixel modification program.Design Principles for ProgrammingIn this module, you will learn the seven-step process for developing a computer program from scratch: from identifying a solution to a problem, to listing out the step-by-step directions of your solution, to translating these directions into code. As part of this process, you will also learn how to test and debug your code. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) replace a green screen background with an image of your own choosing; (2) use the seven-step design process for developing programs from scratch; and (3) debug code using the scientific method.Finding Information in DataIn this module, you will write and use functions in JavaScript programs to manage program complexity with well-developed abstractions. You will also learn how to use arithmetic to manipulate pixel color and values so that you can hide messages in images, an example of what\u2019s called steganography. You will implement the seven-step design process to solve a real world problem of image enlargement. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) write useful functions in JavaScript programs; (2) use arithmetic expressions in manipulating images; and (3) solve problems with the seven-step process. Mini-Project: Create Your E-PortfolioIn this final module for the course, you will bring together your new skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and you will create an e-portfolio\u2014the concluding project for this course.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Programming and the Web for Beginners", "price": 0, "instructors": "Susan H.
