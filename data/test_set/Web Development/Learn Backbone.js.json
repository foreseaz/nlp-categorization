{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Web Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This course is a collection of resources designed to introduce you to Backbone, a common organizational library for front-end web applications.\n\nBy the end of this course, you\u2019ll know how to write well organized web applications using the Backbone framework. You\u2019ll also make use of the Local Storage API or a service like Firebase to support persistent data storage across user sessions.Why Take This Course?There are two reasons this course will help you. First, having experience with a popular organizational library or framework will significantly boost your skill set in the eyes of future employers.\n\nSecond, this course requires you to read external resources and practice learning on your own. Researching and learning new technologies is a critical skill for all Front-End Web Developers. This course will help you put those skills into practice.\n\nThese resources will also:\n\n* provide a high-level view of Backbone, what it provides, and how to organize applications with it\n* demonstrate how to build an app, (chunk by chunk) from simple to more complicated\n* take you step-by-step through the creation of moderately complex sample apps\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course is composed of blog posts, articles, and documentation pages we've curated to get you started with Backbone.\n\n### Getting Started\nUsing this first resource you\u2019ll get an overview of the Backbone framework and the various components that make it up.\n\n### Building a Simple Backbone App\nYou\u2019ll follow a short tutorial to build a simple Backbone application that dynamically calculates a shopping cart total.\n\n### Hello Backbone\nThis resource will walk you through a number of Backbone examples that get progressively more difficult. Get these examples up and running within your own environment and then add functionality and experiment with them!\n\n### Diving Deeper with Backbone\nYou\u2019ll read through a portion of Addy Osmani\u2019s book, Backbone Fundamentals, to gain a deeper understanding of how Backbone helps you create highly organize web applications.\n\n### Building a Todo Application from Scratch\nYou\u2019ll take everything you\u2019ve learned thus far and put those skills into practice as you develop a todo list application.\n\n### Real-time Data with Firebase\nYou\u2019ll learn how to use Firebase within a Backbone application, providing real-time, persistent, data storage.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-09-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Learn Backbone.js", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ben Jaffe", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-backbonejs--ud990?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
