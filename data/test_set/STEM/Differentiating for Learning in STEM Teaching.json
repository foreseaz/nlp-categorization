This free online course - designed for STEM teachers in primary and secondary schools, and sixth form and further education colleges - will help you improve your understanding and use of Differentiating for Learning (DfL) within the STEM subjects.\n\nUnderstand Differentiating for Learning in theory and practice\n\nThrough this course you will:\n\n\n  see extensive real-life classroom video footage;\n  examine the key principles of effective differentiated learning;\n  focus on differentiating by task using examples from the STEM subjects;\n  get a range of practical ideas for how you can best respond to the assessment evidence elicited from your students;\n  and explore the links between Differentiating for Learning and Assessment for Learning.\n\n\nEnjoy your teaching more\n\nAs the course progresses you\u2019ll be encouraged to try Differentiating for Learning in your classroom and laboratory, actively reflect on what you discover in the process, and share your experience as part of the course discussions.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be invited to read some of the research literature about Differentiating for Learning. Your learners will gain as a result - and you\u2019ll enjoy your teaching more.\n\nLearn with Dylan Wiliam, Christine Harrison and Andrea Mapplebeck\n\nThis course has been developed by the National STEM Learning Centre. It gives you the opportunity to learn with three leading experts in STEM education and assessment:\n\n\n  \n    Dylan Wiliam: Emeritus Professor of Educational Assessment at University College London and author of Embedded Formative Assessment;\n  \n  \n    Christine Harrison: Senior Lecturer in Science Education at King\u2019s College London, past Chair of the Association for Science Education and former secondary school teacher;\n  \n  \n    Andrea Mapplebeck: Educational Consultant, Formative Education Ltd and former secondary school teacher.\n  \n\n\nContinue learning with the STEM Teaching program\n\nThis course is one of three in the STEM Teaching program - a suite of high-impact professional development from the National STEM Learning Centre. Completing the program will enable you to master different elements of STEM teaching and earn a FutureLearn Award as evidence of your continuing professional development (CPD).\n\nAbout the National STEM Learning Centre\n\nThe National STEM Learning Centre provides world-class professional development activities and resources to support the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects. The Centre is a purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility based at the University of York backed by an unrivalled team of experts in the fields of education and STEM.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Differentiating for Learning in STEM Teaching", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dylan Wiliam, Chris Harrison and Andrea Mapplebeck", "institution_name": ["National STEM Learning Centre"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/differentiating-for-learning-stem?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
