Modern astronomy extends the human view to previously unexplored regions of space and time. In this course, you will gain an understanding of these discoveries through a focus on relativity\u2014Einstein's fascinating and non-intuitive description of the physical world. By studying relativity and astronomy together, you will develop physical insight and quantitative skills, and you\u2019ll regain a profound sense of wonder for the universe we call home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat topics will the course cover?\n\n\tSection One\u2014Introduction\n\t\tSection Two\u20143, 2, 1 \u2026 Launching the journey into spacetime\n\t\tSection Three\u2014Special relativity: from light to dark\n\t\tSection Four\u2014General relativity: from flat to curved\n\t\n\t\n\tIs there a required textbook?\n\n\t\n\t\tNo textbook is required.
