What is the physics behind these properties? Starting from an electronic or atomic level, how can we arrive at the properties of the materials? These are the questions this course will attempt to answer. Focus will be on electronic properties, but other properties will also be looked at.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Physics of Materials", "price": 0, "instructors": "Prathap Haridoss", "institution_name": ["IIT ( Indian Institute of Technology Madras)"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_mm03/preview", "duration": "14 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2015-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
