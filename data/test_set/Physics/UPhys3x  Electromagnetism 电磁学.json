Most learners and engineering students may choose to study only the basics. Those who want to learn at the level of a physics major should study the advanced sections of the course as well. However, the final examination will only cover the basic parts.\n\n\u672c\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7535\u573a\u548c\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u9700\u898128\u5b66\u65f6 (7\u5468\u5de6\u53f3)\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u6253\u661f\u6216\u53cc\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u548c\u5de5\u79d1\u5b66\u751f\u53ea\u9700\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8981\u8fbe\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5219\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6700\u540e\u8003\u8bd5\u53ea\u8986\u76d6\u57fa\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00Z", "title": "UPhys3x: Electromagnetism \u7535\u78c1\u5b66", "price": 0, "instructors": "Yu An, Liuwan Zhang and Xinyi Chen", "institution_name": ["Tsinghua University"], "commitment": "5-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/electromagnetism-dian-ci-xue-tsinghuax-uphys3x", "duration": "18 weeks", "language_name": ["Chinese"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
