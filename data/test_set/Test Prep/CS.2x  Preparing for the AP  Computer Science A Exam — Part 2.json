This highly interactive course will introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computer science. The course will be structured to encourage students to think computationally and enjoy problem solving. New York City\u2019s companies, museums, art and architecture will be used as examples to emphasize the ubiquitous role of computing and programming concepts in the world around us.\n\nThe course will delve into object- oriented problem solving and design using the Java\u00a0 programming language. \u00a0Students will have access to practice problems that will help them learn to program without spending hours on finding and fixing syntax errors.\u00a0 These will include online multiple-choice questions in the style of those on the AP exam, mixed-up code that the user drags into the correct order, fill in the blank code and audio tours of the code.\n\nTopics include problem solving, \u00a0programming design strategies and\u00a0 data structures, algorithms, role of computation in real-world applications like smart phones, google glass and robots. This material may be used for self-study and as a preview by students and teachers considering the September 2015 offering of the course.\u00a0Video lectures for this course will be available in May 2015.\u00a0\u00a0Ancillary material including labs will be added over the Summer of 2015. All of the course will be available September 1, 2015\n\nThis is a self-paced course - you may take CSAP.1x on your schedule.\n\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\n* Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-09-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "CS.2x: Preparing for the AP* Computer Science A Exam \u2014 Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Anita Raja", "institution_name": ["Cooper Union"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/preparing-ap-computer-science-exam-part-cooper-union-cs-2x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
