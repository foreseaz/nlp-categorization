This course is Part 1 of our XSeries: AP Calculus AB and it is designed to prepare you for the AP exam.\n\nIn Part 2, you will use and apply the meaning and interpretations of derivatives from Part 1 to the integral, antiderivatives and differential equations. You will learn some applications of integrals including finding volumes of solids and solids of revolution, volumes with known cross sections and applications to Velocity-Time graphs. We will close with an introduction to differential equations and see how they are used.\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP calculus teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems. \u00a0By the end of the course, you should be ready to take on the AP exam!\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "AdvCalcAB.2x: Preparing for the AP Calculus AB Exam \u2013 Part 2: Integrals", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tracey Jensen", "institution_name": ["Rice University"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/preparing-ap-calculus-ab-exam-part-2-ricex-advcalcab-2x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
