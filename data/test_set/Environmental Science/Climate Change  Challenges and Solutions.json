It engages a number of experts from the University of Exeter and a number of partner organisations.\n\nThe course will set contemporary human-caused climate change within the context of past nature climate variability. Then it will take a risk communication approach, balancing the \u2018bad news\u2019 about climate change impacts on natural and human systems with the \u2018good news\u2019 about potential solutions. These solutions can help avoid the most dangerous climate changes and increase the resilience of societies and ecosystems to those climate changes that cannot be avoided.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to follow the team prior to the course opening, please look us up on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "Climate Change: Challenges and Solutions", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tim Lenton", "institution_name": ["University of Exeter"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
