In the\ngrand scheme of things it is the blueprint by which the universe operates. We\nsee symmetry in nature, art, architecture, science and engineering. This course\nexplores the Beauty, Form and Function of Symmetry in common objects, then\nprogresses to investigate tiling and tessellation, gems and crystals, and\nfinally its indispensable role in technology.\u00a0\nSymmetry and asymmetry are also key factors that ensure the successful\nreproduction of plants and animals. For example, the bilateral symmetry of\norchids is widely admired and this geometry is essential for insects to pollinate\nthese flowers.Duration: 8 weeksTime Commitment: 7-10 hours per\nweekTarget Group: Scientists and\nEngineers (current and prospective NTU students)Recognition: Verified Certificate through Signature Track enrollmentNTU Academic Units: Verified\nCertificate Students earn 3 Academic UnitsNTU Course Type:\u00a0 Unrestricted Elective or General ElectiveThis course gives you the means to address several fundamental questions.What tags do we recognize in decorative arrangements?What guidelines shape the patterns in the world around us?What functions do these symmetrical patterns serve?How are drug and materials design engineered through\natomic scale symmetry?How is the internal\narrangement of atoms reflected by crystal faceting?How does symmetry manipulation create polytypes, polymorphs and polysomes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo amplify these ideas, you will\nundertake field-exercises and be introduced to specialists - botanists,\nartists, geomancers, historians, scientists and engineers - that work with\nsymmetry, and who will provide their personal insights into its \u2018magic\u2019 and\nimpact on their disciplines.\n\n\n\nThe option of earning AUs is open\nto all students.

There are specific windows for uploading\nhomework and undertaking peer-to-peer marking. These are detailed in the downloadable course timetable.Part I: Basic Concepts of SymmetryWeek 1: \u2018A World of Symmetry\u2019 will refresh your intuitive\nappreciation of symmetry in furniture, botany and common objects and introduce\nthe mathematics of point symmetry.Week 2: \u2018Tiling and the Asymmetric Unit\u2019 begins by examining tessellations\nin architecture that will illustrate key concepts in plane symmetry including\nthe asymmetric unit.\u00a0 \u2018Chirality\u2019 discusses this key concept in symmetry and its impact on drug design\nand delivery.Part II: Plane (2D) and Space (3D)\nSymmetryWeek 3: \u2018Escher and Graphic Design\u2019 introduces symmetry operations in 2 dimensions\nand the difference between \u2018primitive\u2019 and \u2018centered\u2019 unit cells are illustrated\nusing the art of Escher. \u2018Nets\u2019 examines the role of symmetry in Islamic\narchitecture and history in the context of regular networks.Week\n4: \u2018Space Symmetry\u2019 expands the symmetry operations to include 3 dimensional\nmotion.\u00a0 The methodology for reading and\nusing the symmetry diagrams of the 17 plane groups and 230 space groups is\nintroduced.Part III: Symmetry in CrystalsWeek 5: \u2018Crystal Forms and the Beauty of Minerals\u2019 looks the external shape of\nmineral crystals and we learn about crystal power by visiting a geomancer. The manner in which crystal faceting\nreflects the internal atomic arrangements is described. \u2018Planes, Directions and Unit Cell\u2019 introduces the mathematics\nfor describing perfect crystal structures. Week 6: \u2018Platonic Solids and Atomic Bonding\u2019\nshows that regular geometrical shapes can be derived from folding plane \nnets into polyhedra that often describe atomic clustering and also the appearance of defects or\nasymmetry that are important aesthetically and technologically.\u00a0 A laboratory tour will show the experiments\nused to extract crystallographic information.Part IV: Symmetry and TechnologyWeek 7: \u2018Tailoring Crystals for Technology\u2019 brings together chemistry and\ncrystallography, shows how they are inter-related, and how they are adapted to\nengineer designer technological materials.\u00a0\nA clean room fabrication facility provides real world context for\nexploiting chemically- and physically-driven symmetry.Week 8:\u00a0 \u2018Looking for Broken Symmetry - Atomic Scale Imaging\u2019 looks beyond 3 dimensional symmetry to higher dimensional\nrepetitions found in incommensurate crystal structures. \u2018Deceptive Perception - Symmetry &amp; Furniture Design\u2019 returns to the everyday appearance of symmetry that can now be\nexplored analytically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the conclusion of this study, you will\npossess the tools and the motivation to look at symmetry with even greater\ndelight, wonder and appreciation!\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "An Exploration of Symmetry (Eligible for NTU Credit)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tim White", "institution_name": ["Nanyang Technological University"], "commitment": "4-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/ntusym", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
