Each week will cover a different environmental management topic, through video, podcasts and case studies from around the world:\n\nWeek 1: Language of nature\n\nLearn about the different ways that nature is perceived by different types of societies and the impact of property rights on natural resource management. The case study explores the history of different types of ownership in Tanzanian forests.\n\nWeek 2: Mathematics of nature\n\nDiscover the mathematics of nature by examining examples of complexity, causality and diversity, and change in social-economic systems. You will explore population growth and uneven consumption of natural resources.\n\nWeek 3: Environment and conflict\n\nUnderstand the relationship between human conflict and the natural world; what impact does war have on both humans and the environment, and what is the relationship between the two? Scarcity and conflict is explored through the California water shortage and the case study looks at the environment as a weapon of war.\n\nLearn with a range of social-ecological systems experts\n\nThe course is led by Professor Jon Lovett,  Chair in Global Challenges at the University of Leeds. His research focuses on the institutional economics of environmental  management, and takes an interdisciplinary approach to bring together both the natural and social sciences.\n\nJon is the educator responsible for the highly successful University of Leeds course on FutureLearn, Fairness and Nature: When Worlds Collide:\n\n\n  \u201cThis MOOC made me question my own ideas about what is just in issues concerning nature. The teacher is absolutely committed to this subject. His knowledge, resources and enthusiasm make this course, in my opinion, one of the best around.\u201d\n- FutureLearner, Marilyn Rietveld, on Fairness and Nature: When Worlds Collide\n\n\nExperts from a range of different disciplines will also contribute to the discussion and will provide a richness and diversity to the conversation:\n\n\n  Professor Janet Watson, Leadership Chair for Language at Leeds;\n  Abdallah al-Mahri, Mehri language expert;\n  Dr Claire Quinn, Associate Professor of Natural Resource Management, University of Leeds;\n  Pam Warhurst, Chair, Pennine Prospects;\n  Ruth Waters, Natural England;\n  Dr Chris Hassall, School of Biology, University of Leeds;\n  Jane Dawson, Quakers;\n  Dr Manal Nader, Nivine Abbas and Sahar Issa, Institute of the Environment, University of Balamand, Lebanon.\n\n\nThere will be quizzes and debates to explore the issues further and provide an opportunity for you to share your own reflections with Jon, our experts and other learners.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "Environmental Management: Social-ecological Systems", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jon Lovett", "institution_name": ["University of Leeds"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/environmental-management?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
