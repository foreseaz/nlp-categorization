These habitats provide goods and services for hundreds of millions of people but human activities have led to their global decline. TROPIC101x will introduce you to the incredible plants and animals that create these unique ecosystems. You will go on to explore the challenges these ecosystems are facing such as overfishing, coastal pollution, ocean warming and acidification, then learn about some techniques being used to tackle these problems. Lectures will be delivered by leading experts. Many of them were filmed on-site in the Great Barrier Reef, at The University of Queensland\u2019s research station on Heron Island. The course concludes with an innovative virtual ecology project, where you will have the option to take part in a citizen science project. Join us on an exciting journey, as you develop new knowledge and skills, during this beautiful and engaging course!\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-06T00:00:00Z", "title": "TROPIC101x: Tropical Coastal Ecosystems", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ove Hoegh-Guldberg", "institution_name": ["University of Queensland"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/tropical-coastal-ecosystems-uqx-tropic101x-2", "duration": "27 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
