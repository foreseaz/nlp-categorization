This environmental studies course enables participants to apply the principles of a systems approach to food production systems with a focus on environmental sustainability. We will analyze production systems at both ends of the spectrum: highly productive systems with relatively high inputs and emissions to the environment, and low productive systems with low input use and depletion of soil fertility. Crop-livestock interaction is a focal point.\n\nThe course includes:\n\nIntroduction to the complexity of food production systems\n\tIntroduction to systems thinking\n\tAnalysis and comparison of the productivity of food production systems and the environmental issues\n\tThe assessment of environmental sustainability using indicators\u00a0(this last topic allows students to integrate topics of previous modules)\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "STESx: Food Security and Sustainability: Systems thinking and environmental sustainability", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. I.J.M. de Boer, Carolien Kroeze, Gerrie van de Ven, Dr. Eddie Bokkers and Martin van Ittersum", "institution_name": ["Wageningen University"], "commitment": "6-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/food-security-sustainability-systems-wageningenx-stesx", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
