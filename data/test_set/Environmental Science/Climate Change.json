Our insatiable demand for energy from fossil fuels is changing the atmosphere, and in turn changing our climate. Climate change is already affecting the physical surface of the earth, the environment that provides our life support, our food supply, economy and society. These changes will accelerate over the next few decades\r\nIn this course you will explore the impacts of climate change; why we should care about them, the science that underpins our understanding and how we can fix the problem before it\u2019s too late.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nWhy human activities are changing the climate\r\nHow our knowledge of science underpins what we know about the past, present and future climate\r\nWhat our future might hold, and why we should care about it\r\nWhy an increase of 2 or 4\u00b0C in global average temperature is important\r\nHow the changing climate is affecting, and will continue to affect, the incidence and impacts of extreme weather events\r\nThe role of extreme events and the effect it has on our species, ecosystems, coastlines, food supply, health, infrastructure, economy and security\r\nHow climate change is likely to exacerbate existing problems of social inequality\r\nHow climate change will interact with other pressures on global systems such as ecosystem degradation and human population growth\r\nWhy fixing the climate problem is urgent, and how the timing of solutions is critical\r\nThe relative contributions that different emission reduction solutions have had on solving the climate problem\r\n\r\nThis course requires approximately 2 - 4 hours of study per week, but can vary depending on the student. This includes watching videos, and taking quizzes and assessments.\r\nIf you pass this course you'll receive a Certificate of Achievement. While this certificate isn't a formal qualification or credit, you can use it to demonstrate your interest in learning about this area to potential employers or educational institutions.\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nSustainability project officer\r\nSustainability / Climate policy officer\r\nUrban development officer\r\nSustainability manager\r\nEnvironmental and social sustainability consultant\r\nSustainability project manager\r\nSustainability officer\r\nEnvironmental and social sustainability officer\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a01:\u00a0CLIMATE CHANGE: WHY SHOULD WE CARE?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a02:\u00a0WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING AND WHY?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a03:\u00a0WILL WE COPE?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a04:\u00a0FIXING IT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Climate Change", "price": 0, "instructors": "Prof. Lesley Hughes", "institution_name": ["Macquarie University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.open2study.com//node/1762", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open2Study"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
