However, in\u00a0the scientific community, there is little controversy with 97% of climate scientists\u00a0concluding humans are causing global warming.\n\nWhy the gap between the public and scientists?\n\tWhat are the psychological and social drivers of the rejection of the\u00a0scientific consensus?\n\tHow has climate denial influenced public perceptions and attitudes\u00a0towards climate change?\nThis course examines the science of climate science denial.\n\nWe will look at the most common climate myths from \u201cglobal warming stopped in\u00a01998\u201d to \u201cglobal warming is caused by the sun\u201d to \u201cclimate impacts are nothing to\u00a0worry about.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll find out what lessons are to be learnt from past climate change as well as\u00a0better understand how climate models predict future climate impacts. You\u2019ll\u00a0learn both the science of climate change and the\u00a0techniques used to distort the\u00a0science.\n\nWith every myth we debunk, you\u2019ll learn the critical thinking needed to identify\u00a0the fallacies associated with the myth. Finally, armed with all this knowledge,\u00a0you\u2019ll learn the psychology of misinformation. This will equip you to effectively respond to climate misinformation and debunk myths.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a climate MOOC; it\u2019s a MOOC about how people think about climate change.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-08-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Denial101x: Making Sense of Climate Science Denial", "price": 0, "instructors": "John Cook", "institution_name": ["University of Queensland"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/making-sense-climate-science-denial-uqx-denial101x-1", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
