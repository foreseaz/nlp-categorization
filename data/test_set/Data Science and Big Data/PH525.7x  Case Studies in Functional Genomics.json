Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment. We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts of RNA-seq and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level: counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level: inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.\n\nGiven the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.\n\nThese courses make up 2 XSeries and are self-paced:\n\nPH525.1x:\u00a0Statistics and R for the Life Sciences\n\nPH525.2x:\u00a0Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra\n\nPH525.3x:\u00a0Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-throughput Experiments\n\nPH525.4x:\u00a0High-Dimensional Data Analysis\n\nPH525.5x:\u00a0Introduction to Bioconductor: annotation and analysis of genomes and genomic assays\u00a0\n\nPH525.6x: High-performance computing for reproducible genomics\n\nPH525.7x:\u00a0Case studies in functional genomics\n\n\nThis class was supported in part by NIH grant R25GM114818.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code. HarvardX will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the\u00a0edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the HarvardX course; revocation of any certificates received for the HarvardX course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations. Enrollees who are taking HarvardX courses as part of another program will also be governed by the academic policies of those programs.\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning. By registering as an online learner in an HX course, you will also participate in research about learning.
