You\u2019ll learn how  to access open data, clean it and analyse it and to produce visualisations. You will also learn how to write up and share your analyses, privately or publicly.\n\nYou will install free software (see Requirements below) to learn to code in Python, a widely used programming language across all disciplines, due to its support for scientific and engineering libraries and visualisation tools, and wide range of development tools.\n\nYou will write up analyses and do coding exercises using the popular Jupyter Notebooks platform, which allows you to see immediately the result of running your code and helps you identify \u2013 and fix \u2013 any errors more easily.\n\nYou will look at real data from the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and other organisations. You\u2019ll be encouraged to discuss the data and your analyses with your fellow learners, and to build a community of researchers around these and other datasets.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Learn to Code for Data Analysis", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michel Wermelinger", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learn-to-code?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
