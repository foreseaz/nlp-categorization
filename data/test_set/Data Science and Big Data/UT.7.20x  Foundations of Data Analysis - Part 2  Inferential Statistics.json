You\u2019ll learn the basics of statistical thinking \u2013 starting with an interesting question and some data. Then, we\u2019ll apply the correct statistical tool to help answer our question of interest \u2013 using R and hands-on Labs. Finally, we\u2019ll learn how to interpret our findings and develop a meaningful conclusion.\n\nIn this second of a two part statistics course, we will cover basic Inferential Statistics \u2013 integrating ideas of Part 1. If you have a basic knowledge of Descriptive Statistics, this course is for you. We will learn how to sample data, examine both quantitative and categorical data with statistical techniques such as t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA, and Regression.\n\nBoth parts of the course are intended to cover the same material as a typical introductory undergraduate statistics course, with an added twist of modeling. This course is also intentionally devised to be sequential, with each new piece building on the previous topics. Once completed, students should feel comfortable using basic statistical techniques to answer their own questions about their own data, using a widely available statistical software package (R).\n\nThis course will consist of:\n\nInstructional videos for statistical concepts broken down into manageable topics.\n\tGuided questions to help your understanding of the topic.\n\tWeekly tutorial videos for using R. Scaffolded learning with Pre-Labs (using R), followed by Labs where we will answer specific questions using real-world datasets. Weekly wrap-up questions challenging both topic and application knowledge.\nJoin us in learning how to look at the world around us. What are the questions? How can we answer them? And what do those answers tell us about the world we live in?\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "UT.7.20x: Foundations of Data Analysis - Part 2: Inferential Statistics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael J.
