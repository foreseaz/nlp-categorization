Practice  using this\u00a0technique to resolve complicated \nproblems in a range of fields  including the physical and \nengineering\u00a0sciences, finance and economics,  medical, social and \nbiological sciences. Enhance communication  of\u00a0information by creating \nvisual representations of scientific data.\nThis course is a  survey of numerical solution techniques for ordinary \nand partial differential  equations. Emphasis will be on the application\n of numerical schemes to  practical problems in the engineering and \nphysical sciences. Apply advanced  MATLAB routines and toolboxes to \nsolve problems. Review and practice graphical  techniques for \ninformation presentation and learn to create visual  illustrations of \nscientific results\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-01-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Scientific Computing", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["University of Washington"], "commitment": "10-15 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/scientificcomp", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
