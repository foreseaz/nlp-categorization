You will gain the numeracy skills needed to succeed in both employers\u2019 numeracy tests and the workplace. It is designed to build your confidence.\n\nOver three weeks, we will look at where numbers occur in everyday life and what numeracy means in this context.  We will look at the rationale behind employers\u2019 numeracy testing and the skills you will need to be successful.\n\nIn addition to refreshing your understanding of specific numeracy skills (such as percentages, ratios, averages and currency conversions), you will develop essential skills for interpreting numerical data and understanding statistics.\n\nBuild your mathematical confidence\nThe course will develop your skills through a carefully paced, step-by-step introduction to relevant topics with opportunities to check your understanding through quizzes.  There will be feedback at every stage.\n\nCompleting this course will help you build your mathematical confidence and prepare you for both employers\u2019 numeracy testing and using numeracy in the workplace.\n\nWe hope you will join us.\n\nNote: This course includes video content and other visual teaching methods.
