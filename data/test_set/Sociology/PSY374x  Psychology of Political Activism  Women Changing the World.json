Have you ever wondered what motivates some people to become activists? What experiences in your childhood or when you were a teenager may have shaped your political identity? Join us, along with Gloria Steinem, Loretta Ross, and others, in a seven-week exploration of these questions and more. In this course, you will analyze some of the psychological theories that help explain what leads people to want to change society.\n\nThrough rich, interactive case studies you will meet nine prominent women activists who were engaged in efforts and movements in the U.S. from the 1960s through the 1990s including the Civil Rights Movement, the LGBTQ Movement, and the Reproductive Justice Movement. Within our online community you will discuss\u00a0and debate how psychological theories can explain these activists\u2019 motivations, discover where the theories are and are not applicable, and collaboratively create new understandings and analyses.\n\nEach week, Gloria Steinem (SC \u201856) will provide her thoughts and insight into how these theories might apply to contemporary issues.\n\nPhoto Credit: Diana Davies\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "PSY374x: Psychology of Political Activism: Women Changing the World", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lauren Duncan", "institution_name": ["Smith College"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/psychology-political-activism-women-smithx-psy374x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
