Can one person truly make a difference? In this social sciences course, we sample the possibilities and limits of social change in an interconnected, inequitable global landscape.\n\nThis course features in-depth examinations of the rise of garment work for Bangladeshi women, a labor strike in a Mexican suit factory, anti-sweatshop activism in China, and a chat with the president of one of the oldest textile manufacturers in the U.S.\n\nGlobal Sociology is recommended but not required. Let\u2019s start to understand how social change really works.\n\nImage: Ganesh Ramachandran |\u00a0www.purpleganesh.com\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-05-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "SOC103x: Global Social Change", "price": 0, "instructors": "Smitha Radhakrishnan", "institution_name": ["Wellesley College"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/global-social-change-wellesleyx-soc103x", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
