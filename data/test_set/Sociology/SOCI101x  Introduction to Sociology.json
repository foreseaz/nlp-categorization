We start to wonder about the world around us, asking questions like: \u201cHow do certain people become billionaires when others are homeless? Why do humans worship Gods or form families? What makes killing in war acceptable but not in any other situation?\u201d\n\nIf you have ever wondered about these issues and/or other, you aren\u2019t alone. Similar questions have been asked since the beginning of history, and searching for objective answers using scientific research is the goal of sociology.\u00a0\n\nThis course is designed to look critically and analytically through different sociological perspectives, including the functionalist, interactionist, conflict and feminist, to help us realize the extent to which society guides our thoughts and actions. The course material provides a fresh, new look at societies and cultures\u2014more objective, full of inquiry and analysis, striving towards social justice and change. Sociology urges us to draw connections between public issues and personal problems, to see the strange as familiar and the familiar as strange, and to examine biography in a historical and social context.\n\nIssues of inequalities, social class, race, sexual orientation, disability, age and gender are critically examined within a global perspective in this course. You do not need any prior knowledge of sociological theories or methods to take this class.\u00a0 Bring your life experiences and knowledge, and see how the Sociological Imagination will allow you to dispel cultural myths and reframe reality.This course will cover topics found on the CLEP Sociology exam.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "SOCI101x: Introduction to Sociology", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. Joanna Hadjicostandi", "institution_name": ["University of Texas of the Permian Basin"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-sociology-asux-soc101x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
