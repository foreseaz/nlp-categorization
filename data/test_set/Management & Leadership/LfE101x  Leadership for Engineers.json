{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Management & Leadership"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Many of today\u2019s global challenges require tech-driven solutions -- climate change, the growth of the world population, cyber security, the increasing demand for scarce resources, digitalization, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. With this in mind, it is no surprise that one fourth of the CEOs of the world\u2019s 100 largest corporations have an engineering degree.\n\nSolving these global problems requires leaders who, in the first place, are comfortable with technology, models and quantitative analyses -- Leaders who see systems instead of isolated problems. However, simply understanding technology is not enough. Successful leaders today must have both the ideas and the know-how to put these ideas into action by working collaboratively with others, winning their hearts and minds.\n\nWe need leaders who know how to seize opportunities in a networked world, and can mobilize people and other stakeholders for large-scale change. Leaders who lead fulfilling lives and who are able to move themselves and others from the \u2018me\u2019 to the \u2018we\u2019. Leaders who are long-term oriented and who deliver economic profit, while also making positive contributions to society and the environment. We call these leaders \u2018sustainable leaders\u2019.\n\nThis course has three parts:\n\n\n\t\u00a0In the first part, you will explore the context that leaders are facing, building an understanding of the complexities of global and business challenges. You will discover the ambiguities and the many stakeholders that leaders must consider when making their choices. You will get a sense of effective leadership practices.\n\tIn the second part, you will discover your \u201cwho am I\u201d through personal and group exercises. You will create a \u201cPersonal Charter\u201d that can serve as a life-long guide, helping you, as a leader, to make important choices in your personal and professional life.\n\tIn the third part, we will bring the knowledge of the context and yourself together. We will translate the insights of this course into a leadership model and you will discover what sustainable leaders do. We will offer you frameworks to help you make your own career choices. We will finally help you to \u2018sell\u2019 yourself as a leader.\n\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "LfE101x: Leadership for Engineers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Hans de Bruijn", "institution_name": ["Delft University of Technology"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/leadership-engineers-delftx-lfe101x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
