Over 94,000 enrolled in our first two sessions of this course in 2014, and the instructor rating for it was second-highest of all University of Pennsylvania courses on Coursera. \u00a0Here is a\u00a0detailed analysis of course outcomes\u00a0from Session 1. \u00a0Below are a few quotes from Coursera students:I absolutely enjoyed this course. I have some wonderful new tools for my leadership toolbox and I plan to continue my experiments. Thank you Professor Friedman for your compassionate lectures. This was a great course. Very inspiring!\u00a0-- M. W.There is so much goodness in this course, I have been touched to see so many good people showing care and sensitivity to others through peer feedback and discussion forums that I find it soul cleansing. \u00a0The professor has been taking so much efforts to participate in so many discussion forums as well as conduct office hours to help us in our lives. I have found great learning from each of the discussion forums and have got different perspectives.  Peer feedback is a wonderful opportunity for us to help others.\u00a0-- V. S.\u00a0Through your constant nurturing and defining of principles for being a better leader and leading a richer life I think we have all gained knowledge to be leaders in our lives, and it is through this kind of nurturing that all things are possible.  Thank you for putting me back in touch with what makes greatness, the small wins that add up over time.  Your methodology is simple, it is not always easy, but it is worthwhile. -- C.Learn more at Total Leadership and the\u00a0Wharton Work/Life Integration Project. \u00a0Like us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and follow on Twitter @StewFriedman. \u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course is about growing as a leader in all parts of your life and having fun while doing so.
