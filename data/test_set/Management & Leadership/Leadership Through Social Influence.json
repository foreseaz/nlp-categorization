Learners will be able to identify different challenges faced by persuaders and to fashion appropriate strategies for addressing those challenges. The broad goal is to provide learners with not only an extensive persuasion tool kit, but also with an understanding of how different tools are useful in different situations. Specifically, the course will address four broad topics: strategies for influencing people\u2019s personal attitudes; strategies for affecting social factors influencing behavior; strategies for affecting people\u2019s perceived ability to undertake the desired behavior; and strategies for inducing people to act on their existing intentions.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Influencing Attitudes This module discusses the first of four challenges that persuaders often face: getting people to think that what you\u2019re proposing is a good idea. Sometimes, the reason people aren\u2019t already doing what you want is that they\u2019re not yet convinced that they should\u2014that is, they don\u2019t have sufficiently positive attitudes. This module discusses some fundamental strategies for changing people\u2019s attitudes.Influencing Social Factors Even if people have positive attitudes about what you\u2019re proposing, social factors\u2014what they think other people do or want them to do\u2014might lead them to not do what you want. This module discusses several ways in which such social considerations might pose a challenge for persuaders\u2014and discusses how to successfully influence such factors.Influencing Perceived AbilityPeople can have positive attitudes about your advocated action, and all the social considerations can be lined up positively, but still people might not engage in the desired behavior\u2014because they don\u2019t think they can perform the action. That is, they think the behavior is too difficult, too hard to do, they lack the ability. This module discusses strategies for addressing that challenge\u2014strategies for influencing perceived behavioral ability.Converting Intentions into Action Even when people already have the desired positive attitudes, positive social factors, and high perceived ability to perform the behavior\u2014that is, even when they intend to engage in the behavior you want\u2014even then they might fail to do so. When people have the intentions you want but aren\u2019t acting on them, then the challenge is to get people to convert those intentions into actions. This module discusses several strategies that can encourage people to do that. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Leadership Through Social Influence", "price": 0, "instructors": "Daniel J.
