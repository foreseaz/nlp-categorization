Probability topics include counting methods, discrete and continuous random variables, and their associated distributions. Statistical inference topics include sampling distributions, point estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for single- and two-sample experiments, nonparametric statistics, and goodness-of-fit testing. Excel will be used to demonstrate how to solve some class examples, and you'll be expected to use Excel to solve some homework problems. The statistical software package R will be introduced to address very basic statistics problems. Course prerequisites include calculus (differentiation and integration).\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Fundamentals of Engineering Statistical Analysis", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kash Barker", "institution_name": ["The University of Oklahoma"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://janux.ou.edu/course.tag-nextthought-com-2011-10-nti-courseinfo-summer2016-ise-5013.html", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Janux"], "start_date": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
