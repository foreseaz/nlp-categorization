People in the health sciences profession rely on regression modeling to gain insight on make decisions based on a continuous flow of response data.Focusing on linear and multiple regression, this course will provide theoretical and practical training\u00a0in statistical modeling.This is a hands-on, applied course where students will become proficient at using computer software to analyze data drawn primarily from the fields of medicine, epidemiology and public health.There will be many practical examples and homework exercises in this class to help you learn.\u00a0If you fully apply yourself in this course and complete all of the homework, you will have the opportunity to master methods of statistical modeling when the response variable is continuous and you will become a confident user of the Stata* package for computing linear, polynomial and multiple\nregression.*Access to Stata will be provided at no cost for the duration of this course.\n\nThis course was developed in partnership with the Centre Virchow-Villerm\u00e9 for Public Health Paris-Berlin, a bi-national centre of the Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 and Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin.
