As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem \u2013 the World Center for Holocaust Research.

In this meeting we will also refer to the vital Jewish world to be found under various Nazi occupations and influences.\n\nWeek 3: The Isolation Abyss - the Perspective of the Individual\nWe will try to reveal different aspects of Jewish life in the face of the badge of shame, ghettos and segregation, as well as the formation of individual, societies\u2019 and leader\u2019s reactions in the face of a consistent policy of dispossession and discrimination.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed this course, you can continue your learning with The Holocaust: an Introduction - Part 2.\n\nThis online course is offered in an innovative, multi-level format, comprising:\n\nComprehensive lectures by leading researchers from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem.\nA wealth of voices and viewpoints presented by guest lecturers.\nNumerous documents, photos, testimonies and works of art from the time of the Holocaust.\nNovel learning experience: Crowdsourcing \u2013 involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-11-23T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Holocaust: an Introduction - Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Inbar Bondy, Dr Na'ama Bela Shik and Dr. Havi Dreifuss", "institution_name": ["Tel Aviv University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/holocaust-part-1?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
