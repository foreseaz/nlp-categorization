Research across fields as disparate as science, literacy, history, visual processing, curriculum, and computer science suggests that video games aren\u2019t just fun \u2013\nthey can actually be good for your mind as well. In this course, we will discuss current research on the kinds of thinking and learning that go into video games and gaming culture. We\u2019ll investigate the intellectual side of digital gameplay, covering\ntopics that range from perception and attention in Left 4 Dead 2 to the development of historical understanding in Civilization to collaborative learning in massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft. Throughout the course, we examine the\ninherent tensions between contemporary youth culture and traditional education and new developments in games for learning that promise to help bridge that growing divide.\n\nIf you do have questions about the course itself, please direct your inquiries to vglcoursera@gmail.com.\n\nData from this course is being used for quality assurance and for educational research purposes.
