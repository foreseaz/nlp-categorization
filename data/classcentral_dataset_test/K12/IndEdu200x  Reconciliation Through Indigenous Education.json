This is an approach that more and more educators see as far more likely to ensure the success of Indigenous learners, as well as enhance the learning experiences of all students.\n\nChoosing reconciliation as a lens for rethinking policy and learning practices acknowledges that there are contradictions in the current curriculum of schooling that impact the success of Indigenous learners. Reconciliation in this course emphasizes changing institutional structures and personal and professional ideologies to create equitable and inclusive learning environments for Indigenous learners, and where all students should have opportunities to learn from Indigenous histories, traditions, and knowledges as part of a social justice education.\n\nEducators need to be able to respond to educational reforms that prioritize improved educational outcomes for Indigenous learners. In addition, educators must build the capacity of all learners to engage in relationships with Indigenous peoples based on intercultural understanding, empathy, and respect. To support these goals, teachers, administrators, young people, school staff, community-based organizations, and researchers will learn from Indigenous Elders, educational leaders, and culturally relevant learning resources as part of their experiences in this MOOC.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-11-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "IndEdu200x: Reconciliation Through Indigenous Education", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jan Hare", "institution_name": ["The University of British Columbia"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/reconciliation-through-indigenous-ubcx-indedu200x-0", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
