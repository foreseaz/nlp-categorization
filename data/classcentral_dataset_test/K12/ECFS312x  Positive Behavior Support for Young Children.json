Certificates will not be issued.\n\nMany early childhood educators report feeling ill equipped to meet the needs of children with challenging behavior and frustrated in their attempts to develop safe and nurturing early learning environment. If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children\u2019s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.\n\nThe overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "ECFS312x: Positive Behavior Support for Young Children", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gail Joseph", "institution_name": ["University of Washington"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/positive-behavior-support-young-children-uwashingtonx-ecfs312x-0", "duration": "9 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
