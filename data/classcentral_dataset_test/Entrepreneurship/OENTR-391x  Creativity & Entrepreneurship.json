Creativity &amp; Entrepreneurship applies concepts from the creative and musical creation process, such as observing, prototyping, iterating and embracing failure, as a means of guiding you through the concept of thinking like a startup. You will develop the basic mindset, knowledge, and insights required to pursue an entrepreneurial career, whether as the steward of your own career or as the founder of a new business in any field.\n\nCreativity &amp; Entrepreneurship is about the side of entrepreneurship you won\u2019t learn at a business school but, instead, in the music studio.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAbout video original music \"Maria Antoinette\" by Leo Pigot (feat.
