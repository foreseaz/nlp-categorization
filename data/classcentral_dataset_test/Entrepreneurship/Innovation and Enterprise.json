New ideas can be plentiful, but selecting the best ideas and implementing them can be challenging.  Managing the innovation process is neither a scientific process nor a black art.  In addition to detailed research and planning, its success is influenced by human factors and, of course, luck!\n\nIn order to make sense of this complex topic, we have created a model for the innovation process and its management. The course will describe the PROCESS; the way the innovation pathway works from creation of new ideas to their selection and implementation.\n\nWe will study four main areas that influence this process:\n\n\n  We will study the PERSON/PEOPLE that are involved in the process.  This will include the entrepreneur, the inventor and the innovator, for example.\n  By studying the POSSIBILITY of coming up with new ideas and making them happen, we will take a detailed look at creativity and opportunity spotting.\n  We will focus on the PROTECTION of ideas through intellectual property and how this can help/hinder the innovation process.\n  We will look at the PRACTICE of turning an idea into a new product or service.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Innovation and Enterprise", "price": 0, "instructors": "Julie Holland", "institution_name": ["Loughborough University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/innovation-and-enterprise?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
