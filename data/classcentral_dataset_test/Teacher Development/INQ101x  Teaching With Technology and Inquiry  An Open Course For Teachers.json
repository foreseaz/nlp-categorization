This course explores STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) learning and discusses some of the major themes and challenges of integrating inquiry and technology as a community of practitioners. Throughout this course, we will collect and share resources and exchange ideas about what works for specific topics and age groups.\u00a0 We also support design groups to collaboratively develop a new lesson.\n\nIn six weeks, this course will cover the following topics: Inquiry and student-centered pedagogy; designing lessons and assessments; collaborative learning, Handheld and mobile devices; knowledge co-construction; and inquiry enactment.\n\nParticipation options\n\nINQ101x offers two parallel participation options: Foundations strand and Design strand. You can complete INQ101x and obtain a certificate through the foundations strand and engage in reflection, peer discussion, and lesson design evaluation. You can become more deeply involved in lesson design with your peers by entering the Design strand. Enrolled learners have the option to move between the two strands throughout the course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-08-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "INQ101x: Teaching With Technology and Inquiry: An Open Course For Teachers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Rosemary Evans and Jim Slotta", "institution_name": ["University of Toronto"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/teaching-technology-inquiry-open-course-university-torontox-inq101x", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
