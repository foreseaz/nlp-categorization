In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a CTL.SC3x Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos. \n\nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code. MITx will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the edX honor code, which may include dismissal from the MITx course; revocation of any certificates received for the MITx course; or other remedies as circumstances warrant.
