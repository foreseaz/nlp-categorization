Using the basic tools of game theory, we will analyse how businesses choose strategies to attain competitive advantage.\n\nThis course is also available in Chinese.

We answer \u201cwhat is a strategy?\u201d and look at the different ways to determine a best or dominant strategy. We also discuss the concepts of Nash Equilibrium and Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma - and learn that it is important to anticipate and take into consideration the actions of the other players. Lastly, we analyse what happens when we change the game from simultaneous (where everybody acts at the same time) to sequential (where players move after each other).Why Firms Work TogetherAccording to economic theory, companies compete with each other in the marketplace. In reality, they are often friendly and cooperate with each other. In this module, we attempt to understand this strategy, and why it is good for the organizations involved. With this, we evaluate the factors that encourage or hinder cooperation and apply them in different examples.Complementary Products and Strategic PartnershipsIn this module, we introduce complements and discuss what they mean to us in economic terms. We study why companies like to sell their products in a bundle - and how complementarity creates switching costs. We also discuss the importance of that coordination among companies with complementary products. Finally, we look at strategic partnerships as a powerful tool to align companies\u2019 interests in this specific setting.Entering a New MarketThis module is about market entry. We first look at different tools to assess the attractiveness of a market \u2013 and then discuss strategies that have proven to be helpful for entering a new market, such as positioning and marketing strategies. We also look from the other perspective, and analyse what established businesses can do to keep new competitors out of the market.Why Worry About Research and DevelopmentIn the context of R&amp;D, a number of important strategic questions arise consistently; in this module, we take a closer look at these questions. Though many innovations are created by a stroke of luck, it seems that the majority of innovations are created because their inventors actively strive towards this specific innovation and differentiation strategy.Designing Products WiselyIn this module, we focus on strategic aspects of product design and pricing strategy. We analyse how companies can adjust their products in a way that lowers the competitive pressure in the market. Later on, we look at some generic strategies for product design and pricing \u2013 and discuss the problems related to being stuck between these strategies.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-05-23T00:00:00Z", "title": "Competitive Strategy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tobias Kretschmer", "institution_name": ["Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitivestrategy", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
