This digital economy is transforming how we design, plan, respond, make, ship, and operate our products and assets.\r\nThis course will discuss how, in order to capture and create these opportunities, companies must develop an environment in which they can manage information and processes simultaneously across the extended supply chain. These new supply chains are more connected, more intelligent, more responsive, and more predictive. You\u2019ll learn how this is transforming the business processes and systems that are required to remain competitive, and see how it enables processes driven by customer centricity through real-time customer and market visibility. You\u2019ll also discover how to deliver individualized products by harnessing products, assets, and the Internet of Things to drive real-time insights and new business models, and how to leverage the sharing economy to collaborate across all departments, companies, products, and assets. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to build a sustainable organization that understands what the scarcity of labor and natural resources really means, as well as the need to enable end-to-end visibility and bring together business processes and analytics in real time, to run smarter, faster, and simpler.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: How Digital Transformation Is Impacting the Extended Supply ChainUnit 2: Customer CentricityUnit 3: Individualized ProductsUnit 4: Resource ScarcityUnit 5: Sharing EconomyUnit 6: Digital Core of the Extended Supply Chain\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Digital Transformation Across the Extended Supply Chain \u2013 In a Nutshell", "price": 0, "instructors": "Mary Kilgo", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://open.sap.com/courses/escm1", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["openSAP"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
