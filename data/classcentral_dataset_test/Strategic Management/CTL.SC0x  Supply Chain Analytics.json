{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Strategic Management"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Supply chains are complex systems involving multiple businesses and organizations with different goals and objectives. Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.\n\nWe will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.\n\nThis is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.\n\nThis course is part of the MITx MicroMasters\u00a0Credential in Supply Chain Management that is specifically designed to teach the critical skills needed to be successful in this exciting field. In order to qualify for the MicroMasters Credential you will need to earn a Verified Certificate in each of the five courses as well as pass a Capstone Exam. When you sign up for a Supply Chain Analytics Verified Certificate you will also be granted access to supplemental content such as additional practice problems and complementary videos.\u00a0\n\nMITx requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the edX honor code.
