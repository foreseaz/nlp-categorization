{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Strategic Management"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This introductory course will guide your discovery of how businesses function and interact with the wider socio-economic environment.\n\nTensions brought about by competition for resources, the legal and moral frameworks for business activity, and the complexities of knowledge management in organisations will present you with core challenges in the future. Together we\u2019ll explore these dimensions alongside an assessment of the specific business impact of global governance, resource depletion, demographic change, and the power of repeated technology and communications revolutions.\n\nImproving your core knowledge of these new contexts for business activity will ensure you\u2019re better placed to embark upon the next phase of your learning. For those currently in business it gives the chance to reflect, contribute to discussion, and gain recognition for experience.\n\nQuestioning anew the contexts for future commercial and organisational success is imperative; this is the purpose of Discovering Business in Society.\n\nYour learning will be guided by senior staff from the EQUIS-accredited University of Exeter Business School. Passing the exam will lead to exemption from the ACCA paper F1, Accountant in Business.\n\nYou can find out more about what to expect from this course in two posts on our blog - one asking whether corporations are too powerful, the other examining how the world can change in 50 years.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-11-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "Discovering Business in Society", "price": 0, "instructors": "Robin Mason", "institution_name": ["University of Exeter"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/discovering-business-in-society?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2014-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
