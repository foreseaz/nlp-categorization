When it comes to fundraising, organizations must remember that relationships are a two-way street. The best fundraisers engage their donors in a multitude of ways: they build relationships, identify common interests, listen, and show gratitude.\r\nThrough this course, students will learn the ins-and-outs of fundraising from a seasoned fundraiser. Based on the instructor's book \"How to Connect with Donors and Double the Money You Raise,\" the course will show successes and reveal failures that will expose the nuances of effective fundraising practices. Students will then apply the knowledge and stories learned from the class the practices of their own organizations' development teams.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Fundraising: How to Connect with Donors", "price": 0, "instructors": "Thomas Wolf", "institution_name": ["Philanthropy University"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/fundraising-2016-2", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
