Due to this, the customer experience is important and a point of departure for marketing and organizational development.\r\nUnderstanding Customer Experience is an open access graduate course from the Karlstad Business School in conjunction with the Service Research Center \u2013 CTF. The course is designed for professionals with an interest in customer experience and is available to both for-credit and non-credit participants. It is designed for professionals from a wide variety of business areas as well as public organizations. The level of the course content is on advanced university level based, builds on research conducted at CTF and is facilitated by active researchers.\r\nThe course centers around\u2013 Open, collaborative and networked learning practices.\u2013 Interactive video lectures, openly available on all your devices.\u2013 You and your personal and organizational situation.\r\nWe regard learning as a constructive, collaborative, self-directed and contextual process and believe that using the emerging ideas of networked learning is the way forward for lifelong learning. One major intention in designing the course this way is to develop a community of practice around the course content as well as research at CTF.\r\nMore importantly, the course encourages and nurtures rich interaction through a number of open spaces such as our Twitter hashtag #uce151, and our participant blog hub. The open nature of the course and the sharing that it inspires, benefits current and future participants, especially as the goal of the course is to foster and develop long-term, authentic, professional connections. As such, the pedagogical design builds on other open courses such as CK008, EC&amp;I 831, FDOL and ONL.\r\nParticipants will upon completion of the course be able to:\u2013 reflect on central concepts and models linked to psychological aspects of the customer experience and customer experiences of the physical environment in the service sector,\u2013 reflect on central generic and contextual theories that explain why and how the phenomena of customer interaction is realized as well as affect strategies,\u2013 identify and evaluate sources of information in the area of customer experience, and\u2013 analyse, assess and handle complex customer experiences.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Understanding Customer Experience", "price": 0, "instructors": "Per Echeverri, Lars E Olsson, Margareta Friman and J\u00f6rg Pareigis", "institution_name": ["Karlstad University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "http://hhk2.kau.se/uce/", "duration": "20 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-08-24T00:00:00Z"}
