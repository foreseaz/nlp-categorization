Pick one from below:\n                                                                    neuralnets-2012-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    Neural networks use learning algorithms that are inspired by our understanding of how the brain learns, but they are evaluated by how well they work for practical applications such as speech recognition, object recognition, image retrieval and the ability to recommend products that a user will like. As computers become more powerful, Neural Networks are gradually taking over from simpler Machine Learning methods. They are already at the heart of a new generation of speech recognition devices and they are beginning to outperform earlier systems for recognizing objects in images. The course will explain the new learning procedures that are responsible for these advances, including effective new proceduresr for learning multiple layers of non-linear features, and give you the skills and understanding required to apply these procedures in many other domains.  This YouTube video gives examples of the kind of material that will be in the course, but the course will present this material at a much gentler rate and with more examples.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2012-11-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Neural Networks for Machine Learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Geoffrey Hinton", "institution_name": ["University of Toronto"], "commitment": "7-9 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2012-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
