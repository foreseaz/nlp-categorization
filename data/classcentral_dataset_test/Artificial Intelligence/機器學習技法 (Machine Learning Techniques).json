The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on \nCoursera, while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the \ntechnical illustrations. We \nhope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more students in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides \nwill not require advanced English ability to understand, though. If you \ncan understand the following descriptions of this course, you can \nprobably follow the slides.

While many new techniques are being designed every day, some techniques stood the test of time and became popular tools nowadays. The course roughly corresponds to the second \nhalf-semester of the National Taiwan University course \"Machine \nLearning.\" Based \non five years of teaching this popular course successfully (including \nwinning the most prestigious teaching award of National Taiwan \nUniversity) and discussing with many other scholars actively, the \ninstructor chooses to focus on three of those popular tools, namely embedding numerous features (kernel models, such as support vector machine), combining predictive features (aggregation models, such as adaptive boosting), and distilling hidden features (extraction models, such as deep learning). \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Each of the following items correspond to approximately one hour of video lecture.
