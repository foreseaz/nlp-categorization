{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Web Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Node.js is a versatile platform for building all sorts of applications. In this course, we're going to make a dynamic website that displays a Treehouse student's profile information by creating a server that will dynamically generate content, handle URLs, read from files and build a simple template engine.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat you'll learn\r\n\r\nCreating an HTTP Server\r\nReading Files\r\nHandling HTTP Methods\r\nCustomizing HTTP Headers\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Creating a Simple Server in Node.js\u00a0\r\nNode.js has awesome APIs that allow you to build all types of applications. Traditionally you'd need to install a server like Apache or NGINX if you wanted to run a static or dynamic website \u2013 but Node.js allows you to write your own web server with a simple API call.\r\nHandling Routes in Node.js\r\nWhen you type in a web address a request is sent to a server. After a domain name, there's a forward slash and then a path to a resource on the server. Sometimes, this is called a route. In this stage, we'll take a look at how to programmatically handle routes in Node.js.\r\nCreating a Basic Template Engine in Node.js\u00a0\r\nA lot of our HTML contains the same content so we're going to use a principle called DRY, or Don't Repeat Yourself and separate out the unique content in separate files. We'll also write some code that combines all of this content and put in dynamic values \u2013 in other words, we're creating a Template Engine.\r\nHTTP Methods and Headers\r\nCreating your own HTTP servers and web applications requires you to know some of the ins-and-outs of how an HTTP client and HTTP server talk to each other. In this stage we'll take a look at some HTTP headers and HTTP methods.\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Build a Simple Dynamic Site with Node.js", "price": 25.0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "http://treehouse.7eer.net/c/259799/289768/3944", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Treehouse"], "start_date": "2016-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
