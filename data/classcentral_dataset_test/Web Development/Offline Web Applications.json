You'll learn to recognize the differences between good, poor, intermittent, and missing connectivity for your users , and master  how to make applications that navigate these conditions with ease.\n\nUsing the skills you master in this course, you'll conclude by building an app that that works both online and offline, and loads in new data when it can. You'll be a master of the cache! Your web apps will interact with the network just like native apps do. This will lead to better user experiences even in traditionally challenging connection scenarios like being stuck in a train tunnel, having to rely on over-crowded conference Wi-Fi, or traveling through a cellular \u201cdead zone!\u201dWhy Take This Course?User experience\u2014as it is impacted by poor connectivity\u2014is rarely taken into consideration to the extent it should be by developers. Developers build their applications using reliable internet and fast computers. They experience their own creations in an ideal environment, and they are almost always thinking online-first. But if you are truly focused on user experience, you need to understand how your applications perform in all scenarios. This is why it is critical to build applications that are offline-first.\n\nIn order to build applications that look and feel good ALL the time\u2014not just in the best of cases\u2014you need to do more than just learn new techniques and tools, you need to change your approach and way of thinking. This course will help you do just that.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lesson 1: The Benefits of Offline First\n\nLesson 2: Introducing the Service Worker\n\nLesson 3: IndexedDB and Caching\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "Offline Web Applications", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Wales and Jake Archibald", "institution_name": ["Google"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2016-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
