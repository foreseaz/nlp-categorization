We will review the model view controller (MVC) design-pattern in the context of AngularJS. You will be introduced to various aspects of AngularJS including two-way data binding and angular directives and filters. You will then be introduced to angular controllers and scopes. UI routing and templates will then be reviewed. Finally we will look at angular modules and services. Single page application (SPA) development using Angular will also be explored. You must have either completed the previous course in the specialization on Bootstrap, or have a working knowledge of Bootstrap to be able to navigate this course.\n\nAt the end of this course you will:\n\n- Be familiar with client-side Javascript frameworks and the MVC design pattern\n- Be able to implement single page applications in AngularJS\n- Be able to use various Angular features including directives, filters, controllers, scope and routing\n- Be able to implement a functional front-end web application using AngularJS\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Front-End Javascript Frameworks: AngularJS OverviewIn this module we get a quick introduction to front-end JavaScript frameworks, Angular built-in directives, the Model-View-Controller framework, Angular Modules and Controllers and Angular filters.Task Runners, Angular Scope, Forms and Form ValidationIn this module, we will first get an overview of Task runners. We will explore Grunt and Gulp in some detail. Thereafter, we study Angular scope and its use as glue between a view and a controller. Then we study Angular support for forms and form validation. The exercises are time consuming in this module, so you need some patience.Single Page ApplicationsIn this week, you learn about dependency injection in Angular. You will learn how to design custom services. You will learn about Angular templates and their use in single page applications. You will also learn about single page applications and use Angular ngRoute and Angular UI-Router to design single page applications.Client-Server Communication and Angular TestingIn this module you will explore client-server communication using both Angular $http and $resource services. You will then use the Yo web tool from the Yeoman toolset to scaffold an Angular application. You will also learn about testing Angular applications.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jogesh K.
