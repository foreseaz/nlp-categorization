Pick one from below:\n                                                                    webapplications-001\n                                                                    webapplications-002\n                                                                    webapplications-003\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one.

My goal, rather, is to put you on the right path by providing a solid foundation and framework for understanding web applications, allowing you to dig deeper and learn more on your own. The next bullet points describe how we're going to do this.Understand the major architectural components in web apps, and how they fit together. \u00a0Modern web apps are complex. \u00a0A typical application has a database along with numerous scripts on one end of the web stack, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet, and a user's browser on the other end of the web stack. \u00a0Even getting started in trying to understand these components can be overwhelming. Consider just the programming languages involved in a typical web stack: from the database (SQL), to the web server (scripting language), to the browser (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), we're dealing with five different programming languages, not to mention the protocols they're operating over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013\u00a0and you need to know a little about them too! We'll introduce a number of software design patterns throughout the course that are aimed at helping you to manage this complexity.Use Ruby on Rails. \u00a0We're going to learn about web apps through the Ruby on Rails framework.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRails is a framework for creating web\napplications that is built on top of the Ruby programming language.\u00a0I believe this is one of the best frameworks\nfor learning about web applications, and it's also proving highly successful as\na platform for commercial offerings.\u00a0\nThat said, there are many other frameworks available, and the concepts\nyou will learn using Rails are transferable to these other frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter understand modern software engineering\npractice.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be using the latest tools and practices in\nsoftware development, source code control, testing, and application\ndeployment.\u00a0This will include exposure\nto agile development practices, the numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and the cloud-based resources that are\nbecoming increasingly important in web applications.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \u00a0Week One\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Module 1: Introduction and Background\u00a0\u00a0 Lecture 1: Historical Perspective\u00a0 Lecture 2: What is a Web Application?\u00a0 Lecture 3: Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 Application Architectures\u00a0 Lecture 4: Design Patterns\u00a0 Lecture 5: Setting up Your Development EnvironmentWeek Two\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Module 2: Ruby on Rails\u00a0\u00a0Lecture 1:\u00a0Rails Overview\u00a0 Lecture 2: Your First Rails App\u00a0 Lecture 3: The Blog App\u00a0\u2013 Iteration 1\u00a0 Lecture 4: Rails Philosophy\u00a0 Lecture 5: Version Control\u00a0 Lecture 6: Git and RailsWeek Three\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Module 3: Database Interactions\u00a0\u00a0Lecture 1:\u00a0Relational Databases\u00a0 Lecture 2: Databases in Rails\u00a0 Lecture 3: The Active Record Design Pattern\u00a0 Lecture 4:\u00a0The Blog App\u00a0\u2013 Iteration 2 (Associations)\u00a0 Lecture 5:\u00a0The Blog App\u00a0\u2013 Iteration 3 (Validations)Week Four\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Module 4: The Ruby Programming Language\u00a0 Lecture 1: Ruby Background\u00a0 Lecture 2: Classes and Inheritance\u00a0 Lecture 3: Objects and Variables\u00a0 Lecture 4:\u00a0Strings, Regular Expressions and Symbols\u00a0 Lecture 5:\u00a0Expressions and Control Structures\u00a0 Lecture 6: Collections, Blocks and IteratorsWeek Five \u2013\u00a0Module 5: Middleware\u00a0 Lecture 1: What is Middleware?\u00a0 Lecture 2: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Introduction\u00a0 Lecture 3: HTTP \u2013 Request\u00a0 Lecture 4:\u00a0HTTP\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Response\u00a0 Lecture 5:\u00a0The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern\u00a0 Lecture 6:\u00a0Rails Controllers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Request Handling\u00a0 Lecture 7:\u00a0Rails Controllers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Response\u00a0 Lecture 8:\u00a0MVC Implementation in Rails\u00a0 Lecture 9:\u00a0The Blog App\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Iteration 4Week Six \u2013\u00a0Module 6: Presentation/User Interface\u00a0 Lecture 1: Introduction and Background\u00a0 Lecture 2: HTML\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Basic Syntax\u00a0 Lecture 3: HTML \u2013 Document Structure\u00a0 Lecture 4:\u00a0HTML \u2013 Forms\u00a0 Lecture 5: Dynamic Content\u00a0 Lecture 6: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)\u00a0 Lecture 7: JavaScript and jQuery\u00a0 Lecture 8: Ajax\u00a0 Lecture 9:\u00a0The Blog App\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Iteration 5\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Web Application Architectures", "price": 0, "instructors": "Greg Heileman", "institution_name": ["University of New Mexico"], "commitment": "6-9 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
