One of the benefits of using CSS-based columns is flexibility; content flows from one column to another, and the number of columns can vary depending on the size of the device or viewport.\r\nFlexbox is a powerful new feature that makes CSS more efficient for layout. Elements can be dynamically rearranged on the page, laid out in any direction, have flexible dimensions to adapt to the display space, and much more!\r\nUnderstanding CSS Transitions and Transforms\r\nCSS transitions provide a way to control property changes over a given duration. We can also specify time intervals, durations and timing functions that follow a customizable acceleration curve.\r\nCSS transforms let us change the position of elements without disrupting the normal document flow. Transforms are implemented using properties that let us apply transformations like rotation, skewing, scaling and translation in both the plane and 3D space.\r\nCSS Animation Basics\u00a0\r\nCSS animations change properties over time using keyframes to indicate the start/end states of the animations and intermediate points along the way. We're able to control animations by including iteration values, delaying their start time, play states, and more.\r\nWorking with Media Queries\r\nMedia queries allow designers to apply CSS declarations dynamically based on client conditions. Using media features like width, height and color, we can tailor our content to a wide range of devices and resolutions without having to change the content itself.\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "CSS - Beyond the Basics", "price": 25.0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "4-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "http://treehouse.7eer.net/c/259799/287718/3944", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Treehouse"], "start_date": "2016-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
