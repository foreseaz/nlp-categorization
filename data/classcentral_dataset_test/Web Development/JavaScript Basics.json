In this course, you'll learn the fundamental programming concepts and syntax of the JavaScript programming language.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat you'll learn\r\n\r\nWhat JavaScript is and where it is used\r\nBasic programming concepts like variables, data types and conditional statements\r\nWhat functions are and why they're useful\r\nHow to troubleshoot programming problems\r\nThe basic syntax of the JavaScript programming language\r\n\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introducing JavaScript\u00a0\r\nLearn about the most popular scripting language on the planet. The language that drives millions of interactive web sites, powers fast web servers and can even be used to build desktop applications. In this stage, you'll create your first JavaScript program and learn how to troubleshoot your programming mistakes.\r\nStoring and Tracking Information with Variables\r\nLearn how to use variables to store information that changes during a program, like the score in a game, or a sales total. You'll also learn about different data types in JavaScript like string, numbers and boolean values.\r\nWorking With Numbers\r\nNumbers are everywhere in programming. You use them to track a player's score in a game, to calculate the cost of shipping a product, or just to count the number of times a \"Like\" button was clicked on a page. In this section of the course, you'll learn how to do basic math in JavaScript.\r\nMaking Decisions with Conditional Statements\r\nConditional statements let you control the \"flow\" of your program. They let you run different code based on conditions in your program.\r\nCreating Reusable Code with Functions\r\nJavaScript functions are a powerful tool that let you create re-usable chunks of code. They make programming faster, easier and less error-prone. They are also one of the most important concepts in JavaScript programming.\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "JavaScript Basics", "price": 25.0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6-7 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "http://treehouse.7eer.net/c/259799/287722/3944", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Treehouse"], "start_date": "2016-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
