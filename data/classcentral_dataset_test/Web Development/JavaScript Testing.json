You'll write comprehensive suites of tests that validate your application is functioning as intended at all times.\n\nYou'll start by exploring how other industries use a variety of tests and the value it provides. You'll then start writing your very own tests, using the Jasmine testing framework. Finally, you'll start developing your very own address book application using the red-green-refactor workflow and explore a variety of scenarios including testing asynchronous functions.Why Take This Course?As your applications become more complex and you continue adding new features, you need to verify your additions haven't introduced bugs to your existing functionality. Automated testing provides this functionality and allows you to focus on.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Overview\nThis course consists of 2 lessons. In the first lesson, you'll discover the importance of testing and reconsider its purpose and the value it provides. In the second lesson, you'll explore the Jasmine testing framework write your own test suites while developing an address book application.\n\n### Lesson 1: Rethinking Testing\nFrom education to aerospace, tests provide invaluable feedback to those that analyze the results. In this lesson, you'll learn all about the importance of testing, how to identify the expectations a test is attempting to validate and how to write expectations in code.\n\n**Topics covered:**\n\n* What is a test?\n* Validating opinions\n* Identifying and defining expectations\n* Writing expectations in code\n\n### Lesson 2: Writing Test Suites\n\nJavaScript doesn't support testing natively, so you'll need a framework to provide the functionality you need. In this lesson, you'll get an introductions to the Jasmine testing framework and use the red-green-refactor workflow to begin development on an address book application.\n\n**Topics covered:**\n\n* Introduction to Jasmine\n* Writing suites, specs and tests\n* The red-green-refactor workflow cycle\n* Testing asynchronous functionality\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-03-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "JavaScript Testing", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Wales", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2015-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
