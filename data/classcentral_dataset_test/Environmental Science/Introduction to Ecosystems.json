Using case studies, you will come to learn how knowledge of ecosystems leads to understanding of their individual importance, and how they can be preserved.\n\nAll Open University science courses presented on FutureLearn are produced with the kind support of Dangoor Education.\n\nFind out more in David Robinson\u2019s post for the FutureLearn blog: \u201cWhy learn about ecosystems?\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Ecosystems", "price": 0, "instructors": "David Robinson", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/ecosystems?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
