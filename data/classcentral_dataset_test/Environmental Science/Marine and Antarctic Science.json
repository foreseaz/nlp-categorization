Do you know what a nudibranch is? Or how a kelp forest functions? Did you realise that the ocean \u2018pumps\u2019 carbon? Are you interested in how marine systems; from coral reefs to Antarctic ecosystems are managed?\r\nThis course will introduce you to the fascinating world of our oceans. You will learn about marine life and key features of the ocean system. You will also explore some of the stressors on marine systems caused by human activity. Finally, this course will cover how society might sensibly approach managing those threats into the future.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nHow life has evolved in the sea\r\nHow marine food webs are structured\r\nHow some particularly interesting ecosystems function such as kelp forests, the Antarctic ocean, and the deep sea\r\nWhat oceanographers do and some of the technologies they use\r\nWhat drives plant growth and thus ecosystem productivity in the oceans\r\nThe role of the ocean in shaping and regulating our climate\r\nHow plate tectonics shape the ocean basins and influence current patterns\r\nConsequences of climate change for ocean processes and marine biota\r\nHow fishing and other human pressures affect ocean systems\r\nHow seafood is likely to be an important food source in the future\r\nHow we monitor and manage marine ecosystems\r\n\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nOceanographer or other marine scientist\r\nFisheries scientist or other marine biologist\r\nEcotourism\r\nPublic policy\r\nMarine manager\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a01:\u00a0MARINE LIFE\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a02:\u00a0THE OCEAN SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a03:\u00a0CLIMATE CHANGE AND MULTIPLE STRESSORS\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a04:\u00a0STEWARDSHIP OF THE OCEANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Marine and Antarctic Science", "price": 0, "instructors": "Professor Craig Johnson and Dr Jess Melbourne-Thomas", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.open2study.com//node/1755", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open2Study"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
