We are presently confronted by an unprecedented paradox:\u00a0 the negative consequences of fossil fuel combustion have never been clearer, but oil and gas extraction are experiencing a technological revolution.\u00a0 How long with fossil fuel supplies last? What are the long-term implications of fracking and other technologies that extend their use? At what point will renewable energy systems replace fossil fuels altogether?\u00a0 Such questions have a direct impact on our health, wealth, and security, but reliable answers are scarce. \u00a0In this class we will develop a unique, \u201cbig picture\u201d perspective on these issues, based on the concept that all energy systems, fossil and renewable, depend on finite geologic resources of the Earth.\u00a0 Armed with this perspective, energy consumers, producers, and policy makers can make more informed choices for the future.\u00a0 This course will emphasize three universal principles: Energy quality matters more than quantity,\u00a0\u00a0 Technological advances continually redefine reality, and All energy systems carry their own negative consequences.\u00a0 We will explore energy options ranging from solar to nuclear, revealing how the above principles apply to each. \u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\u00a0 \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d: the historic and geologic context of human energy use.Week 2:\u00a0 \u201cLeveraging the Past\u201d: energy sources that have been naturally enriched through the leverage of geologic time.Week 3:\u00a0 \u201cLiving in the Present\u201d: renewable energy sources that draw on the present flux of energy from the Sun.Week 4:\u00a0 \u201cPlanning for the Future\u201d: prospects and challenges of future energy use.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-07-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Energy and the Earth", "price": 0, "instructors": "Alan Carroll", "institution_name": ["University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/earthenergy", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
