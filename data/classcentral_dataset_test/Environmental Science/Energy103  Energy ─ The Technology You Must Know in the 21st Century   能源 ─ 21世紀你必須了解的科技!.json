{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Environmental Science"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Energy technology is a highly multidisciplinary subject, which extends from engineering (e.g. mechanical, chemical, civil, environmental and electrical) to economy and ecology. This course is designed for students with limited engineering knowledge. It gives a broad overview of energy technology, mainly focusing on electric power generation. Before introducing technical aspects of power generation, impacts of excessive fossil fuel consumption to the environment, such as global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and emissive pollutants, are addressed. In addition, strategies and challenges of energy security and social justice for resource-poor countries, such as an island region of Taiwan, will be emphasized.\n\nThe technical topics cover most of the existing and emerging technologies, which include:\n\nFossil Fuel and Thermal Power Plants\n\tFuel Cells\n\tSolar Energy \u2192 Photovoltaic &amp; Concentrating Solar\n\tWind Energy\n\tHydroelectric Power &amp; Ocean Energy\n\tGeothermal Energy\n\tBiomass Energy\n\tNuclear Energy\nThe students will gain comprehensive knowledge of the above listed energy technologies, in which the working principles, their practical applications and the latest progresses are emphasized. Based on the knowledge learn in the classes, the students will be aware about the pros and cons of these technologies, and be able to make their choices for selecting the most desired energy. The course will also provide guidance for those who are interested in perusing their future careers or advanced educations in energy-related fields.\n\nThis course was developed and is being offered by National Chiao-Tung University through OECx.\n\n\u80fd\u6e90\u79d1\u6280\u662f\u4e00\u9580\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8de8\u9818\u57df\u7684\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u7bc4\u7587\u53ef\u5f9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9818\u57df(\u5305\u542b\u6a5f\u68b0\u3001\u5316\u5de5\u3001\u571f\u6728\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u548c\u96fb\u6a5f)\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u7d93\u6fdf\u8207\u751f\u614b\u5b78\u7b49\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u70ba\u4ecb\u7d39\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u6e90\u5de5\u7a0b\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u901a\u8b58\u6027\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b78\u751f\u5168\u9762\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u79d1\u6280\u6982\u8ff0\u3002\u5167\u5bb9\u4ee5\u4ecb\u7d39\u767c\u96fb\u6280\u8853\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u4e26\u4ecb\u7d39\u904e\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u5c0d\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u5982\u5168\u7403\u6696\u5316\u3001\u81ed\u6c27\u5c64\u7834\u58de\u3001\u9178\u96e8\u548c\u6392\u653e\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u7b49\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e3b\u984c\u6db5\u84cb\u73fe\u6709\u6210\u719f\u548c\u65b0\u8208\u767c\u5c55\u80fd\u6e90\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\n\n\u5316\u77f3\u71c3\u6599\u8207\u539f\u52d5\u529b(\u767c\u96fb)\u5ee0\n\t\u71c3\u6599\u96fb\u6c60\n\t\u592a\u967d\u80fd - \u5149\u4f0f\u7279\u6548\u61c9\u8207\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u71b1\u80fd\n\t\u98a8\u80fd\n\t\u6c34\u529b\u8207\u6d77\u6d0b\u80fd\n\t\u5730\u71b1\n\t\u751f\u8cea\u80fd\n\t\u6838\u80fd\n\u5b78\u751f\u65bc\u4fee\u7fd2\u6b64\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c07\u53ef\u6574\u9ad4\u6027\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6280\u8853\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3001\u5be6\u969b\u61c9\u7528\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u540c\u6642\u65bc\u4fee\u7fd2\u5f8c\u4ea6\u53ef\u4e86\u89e3\u5230\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6280\u8853\u7684\u512a\u7f3a\u9ede\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u9078\u64c7\u6700\u9069\u7528\u80fd\u6e90\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5224\u65b7\u4f9d\u64da\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ea6\u53ef\u5c0d\u672a\u4f86\u6709\u8208\u8da3\u5f9e\u4e8b\u80fd\u6e90\u9818\u57df\u5de5\u4f5c\u6216\u9032\u884c\u80fd\u6e90\u6280\u8853\u6df1\u9020\u7684\u540c\u5b78\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c3\u8003\u3002\n\n\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-12-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Energy103: Energy \u2500 The Technology You Must Know in the 21st Century | \u80fd\u6e90 \u2500 21\u4e16\u7d00\u4f60\u5fc5\u9808\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u79d1\u6280!", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ching-Yao Chen", "institution_name": ["Open Education Consortium (OEC)"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/energy-technology-you-must-know-21st-oecx-energy103", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["Chinese"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2014-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
