This is your course!\n\nIn a voyage through the Earth, Geoscience: the Earth and its Resources\u00a0will explore the Earth interior and the processes forming mountains and sedimentary basins. You will understand how the sediments are formed, transported, deposited and deformed.\n\nYou will develop knowledge on the behavior of petroleum and water resources.\n\nThe course has an innovative approach focusing on key fundamental processes, exploring their nature and quantitative interactions. It will be shown how this\u00a0acquired knowledge is used to predict the nature and behavior of the Earth subsurface.\n\nThis is your ideal first step as a future Geoscientists or professional to upgrade your knowledge in the domain of Earth Sciences.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "GEO101x: Geoscience: the Earth and its Resources", "price": 0, "instructors": "Giovanni Bertotti", "institution_name": ["Delft University of Technology"], "commitment": "8-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/geoscience-earth-its-resources-delftx-geo101x", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
