Examining links between food insecurity and the rising tide of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases around the globe, it will demonstrate how the issue is particularly relevant in the developed world.\n\nIt will continue on to examine threats to global food security posed by parasites, which undermine the health of animals and plants, damaging food production systems globally. Having considered threats to global food security the course will look at approaches to sustaining healthy agri-food systems such as the benefits of applied genetics for fisheries management and aquaculture.\n\nThe course will conclude by considering societal concerns around animal welfare, as pressure builds to increase production intensity whilst reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nUsing cutting edge research undertaken by the Institute of Global Food Security (IGFS) the course will illustrate how aspects of the global food crisis might be addressed, in order to sustain and manage healthy food systems into the future.\n\nThe course is led by Professor Chris Elliott, who wrote the UK government review on the recent horsemeat scandal.
