The food we eat, the car we drive, lights that illuminate our cities or the radio that plays our favorite songs, are all manifestations of energy. Our biological life can be explained in terms of energy and even our emotions and feelings to a certain extent.\r\nEver since humankind has walked the Earth, we have constantly changed ourselves and the world we live in. In the contemporary era, we have learned more on the laws of nature achieving admirable results in the field of science, technology, agriculture and health and we have learned how to use energy for satisfying societal needs. On the other side, we are more and more contributing to medium term natural changes with a deadly cocktail of greenhouse effect, local pollution and plundering of ecosystems. The uneven distribution and access to energy resources hinders social inclusion and equity.\r\nThe world energy challenge goes right to the heart of this paradoxical question. On the one hand, it is undeniable that the achievements of modern civilization are linked with the capability of humankind to handle energy resources. Nonetheless, energy production at current rates, and with the current mix of resources, results in serious and irreversible environmental changes, while determining socio-economic inequalities and triggering geopolitical tensions.\r\nThe world energy challenge deals also with our psychological and cultural aptitude: the willingness to progress at all costs that often make us no longer able to set the path toward an authentic human and social progress. In doing so, the contemporary energy crisis goes along with a civilization crisis.\r\nThe transition of the energy system toward a more equitable, green and fair asset with rational energy use is also urgent in the broader context of the Agenda 2030 and the new sustainable development paradigm just launched by the United Nations organization.\r\nIn this regards, the energy transition is not an end in itself but rather a means to achieve human prosperity: people are at the center of this transition.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "ASPenergy101 - The strange paradox of the world energy question", "price": 0, "instructors": "Emanuela Colombo, Pierluigi Leone and Michele Cal\u00ec", "institution_name": ["Alta Scuola Politecnica"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.pok.polimi.it/courses/course-v1:Polimi+ASPenergy101+2016_M6/about", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Polimi OPEN KNOWLEDGE"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
