It is both a way of understanding the world \nand a method for solving global problemsA Short History of Economic DevelopmentThe world we\u2019ve seen is divided \u2013 startlingly so \u2013 with 55 high-income economies (1.3 billion people), \n103 middle-income countries (4.9 billion people), and 36 low-income countries (0.8 billion people). How \ndid these vast differences across the world come about? How is it that there are countries like the \nUnited States at more than $50,000 dollars per person per year of income, and countries like Niger at \nunder $500 dollars per person per year, less than 100th the income levels of the high-income countries\nwhen measured at market exchange rates? This huge gap certainly did not exist two centuries ago. \nGrowth within Planetary BoundariesTo achieve sustainable development, countries need to achieve three goals simultaneously: economic \ngrowth, broad-based social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. While many countries have \n\u201csolved\u201d the growth puzzles, few have succeeded in achieving all three aspects of sustainable \ndevelopment.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-11-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Sustainable Development", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jeffrey Sachs", "institution_name": ["Columbia University"], "commitment": "1-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/sustainabledevelopment1", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
