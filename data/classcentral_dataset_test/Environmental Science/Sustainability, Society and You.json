It is crucial that we all play our part in protecting our world for current and future generations. This course provides you with the knowledge and skills to do this by investigating sustainability from multiple angles and exploring what small steps you can take to have a real impact upon all our futures.\n\nThe course team includes academics and postgraduates from many disciplines and is led by Professor Sarah Speight, from Nottingham\u2019s School of Education. Through videos, readings, activities and discussions, you will explore sustainability from the perspective of the environment, the economy, health, politics, society and culture, education and community.\n\nYou will be encouraged to look at your own behaviours and undertake activities such as measuring your water footprint, conducting a waste audit, researching, blogging and sourcing images. We encourage course participants to find, produce, share and discuss resources for sustainability.\n\nThe University of Nottingham is an education partner of IEMA, the Institute of Environmental Management &amp; Assessment. IEMA\u2019s role is to support individuals and organisations to set, recognise and achieve global sustainability standards and practice. Nottingham and IEMA are pleased to be working collaboratively on this course.\n\nRecommended reading\n\nWhy not download some of our free eBooks to help you read around the topic and be ready to join the discussions.
