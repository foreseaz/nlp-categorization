It will help you understand the transmedia storytelling trend and how to tell compelling stories across multiple platforms.\n\nOver six weeks, we\u2019ll ask:\n\n\n  What is transmedia storytelling? And how does it differ from related ideas like media convergence and one source multi use (OSMU)?\n  How do the key elements of character, plot and setting create a memorable story?\n  What can we learn from folklore and traditional narratives?\n  And how is storytelling in the digital age different from previous forms?\n\n\nThroughout, we\u2019ll look at successful examples of transmedia storytelling - such as The Avengers, The Matrix and Transformers - and put theory into practice, by retelling the popular fable, The Three Little Pigs, in a multiplatform format.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn with Daniel H Byun - the film director also known as \ubcc0\ud601.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "Transmedia Storytelling", "price": 0, "instructors": "Young-Sung Kwon and Daniel H.
