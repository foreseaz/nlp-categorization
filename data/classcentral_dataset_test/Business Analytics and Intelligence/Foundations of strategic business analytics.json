You will then learn to create those groups in a business-oriented and actionable way. We will use examples to illustrate various concepts. The assessments will also provide you with opportunities to replicate these examples.Factors leading to eventsIn this module, you will learn why using rigorous statistical methods to understand the relationship between different events is crucial. \n\nWe\u2019ll cover two examples: first, using a credit scoring example, you will learn how to derive information about what makes an individual more or less likely to have a strong credit score? Then, in a second example drawn from HR Analytics, you will learn to estimate what makes an employee more or less likely to leave the company. \nAs usual, we invite you to replicate those examples thanks to the recital \nand to use the assessments provided at the end of the module to strengthen your understanding of these concepts.Predictions and Forecasting In this module you will learn more about the importance of forecasting the future.\n\nYou will learn through examples from various sectors: first, using the previous examples of credit scoring and HR Analytics, you will learn to predict what will happen. Then, you will be introduced to predictive maintenance using survival analysis via a case discussion. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss seasonality in the context of the first example discussed in this MOOC: using analytics for managing your supply chain and logistics better. \nRecommendation production and prioritizationSo far, you\u2019ve learnt to use Business Analytics to glean important information relevant to the success of your business.
