You will also learn about the Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics and the coherent and squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. The course concludes with two state systems and their applications to NMR and masers.\n\nThis is the second of three courses offering a sophisticated view of quantum mechanics and its proper mathematical foundation.\n\nPart 1: Wave Mechanics\n\tPart 2: Quantum Dynamics\n\tPart 3: Entanglement\u00a0and Angular Momentum\nTo understand the material in this course you should have taken Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Wave Mechanics.\n\nCompleting the 3-part Quantum Mechanics series will give you\u00a0the necessary foundation to pursue advanced study or research at the graduate level in areas related to quantum mechanics\n\nThe series will follow MIT\u2019s on campus 8.05, the second semester of the three-course sequence on undergraduate quantum mechanics, and will be equally rigorous. 8.05 is a signature course in MIT's physics program and a keystone in the education of physics majors.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLearner Testimonials\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought long and hard to come up with a better MOOC than this one (I\u2019ve completed 25 of these things over the past 2 years) and can\u2019t do it. 8.05x is #1 and I suspect will stay that way for some time to come.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u201cBeing an engineering student from India trying to shift to Physics, I am often faced with the requirement to study topics on my own. Very often this has led me to feel inadequate. 8.05x was the perfect opportunity for me to both gain knowledge and evaluate my understanding on a high quality international platform. It has really exceeded my expectations. Now, at the end of fifteen weeks, I feel more confident and hopefully I am more knowledgeable.\u201d\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "8.05.2x: Mastering Quantum Mechanics Part 2: Quantum Dynamics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Barton Zwiebach and Saif Rayyan", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "12 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/mastering-quantum-mechanics-part-2-mitx-8-05-2x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
