Make sure to check for reruns of this course.\n\nPHYS_102x serves as an introduction to electricity and magnetism, following the standard second semester college physics sequence. It begins with electric charge in matter, the forces between charges, the electric field, Gauss's Law, and the electric potential. Electric current and resistance are introduced, followed by descriptions of resistors, capacitors, and DC circuits.. The course then moves to the magnetic field, Ampere's Law, and Faraday's Law of Induction. Finally, inductors and AC circuits are described.\n\nPHYS_102x consists of ~2 hours of weekly video lectures, weekly online homework questions, a one page peer assessed design project, and two online exams. The course runs 12 weeks, but during the two exam weeks there will be no new topics or homework assignments. It is recommended that student work consistently every week and should expect to spend 10-12 hours per week on course content.\n\u00a0\nThe following components will make up PHYS_102x.\n\nVideo Lectures and Lecture Questions\n\tHomework Problems\n\tMidterm and Final Exams\n\tOnline Discussion Forum\nPHYS_102x is targeted to an audience with a wide range of backgrounds and abilities from motivated high school students to people returning to their studies after a break. The prerequisites for this course are calculus and introductory mechanics.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-04-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "PHYS_102x: Electricity & Magnetism", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jason H.
