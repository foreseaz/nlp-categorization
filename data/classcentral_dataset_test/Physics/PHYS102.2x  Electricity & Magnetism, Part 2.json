{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Physics"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    PHYS 102x serves as an introduction to electricity and magnetism, following the standard second semester college physics sequence. Part 2 begins with the nature of the magnetic field and how it is created by current distributions and magnetic materials. Next, Faraday\u2019s law of induction is described, as well as some of its applications and interesting effects. Finally, inductors and AC circuits are covered, including RLC circuits, reactances of circuit elements, and resonance. PHYS 102.2x consists of 5 weekly learning sequences, each with ~1.5 hours of video lectures, conceptual lecture problems, and online homework questions. The course concludes with an online exam during the 6th week.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat are the prerequisites?\nWe will assume that you are familiar with vectors, that you know how to calculate integrals, and that you have had introductory mechanics. These topics will be briefly reviewed as needed, but not in a systematic way. If you have not had classes in these topics it may be possible to complete the course with extra study.\n\nWhat textbook is required?\nThe course will not strictly follow or make assignments from a specific textbook.\u00a0 Any recent freshman physics textbook will suffice. Reading assignments will be given by topic, including links to several free online physics textbooks.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-04-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "PHYS102.2x: Electricity & Magnetism, Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jason H.
