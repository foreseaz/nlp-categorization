This course is Part 1 of our AP Physics 2 series designed to prepare you for the AP exam.\u00a0\n\nIn Part 1, you will learn about fluids and thermodynamics. You will explore pressure, buoyant forces and concepts that involve conservation of mass and energy. You will also be learning about heat, its transfer and how we have taken advantage of its behavior in different types of technology.\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP physics teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to take on the AP exam!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis course is authorized as an Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP\u00ae) course by the AP Course Audit. The AP Course Audit was created by the College Board to give schools and students the confidence that all AP courses meet or exceed the same clearly articulated curricular expectations of colleges and universities.\n\nBy taking an AP course and scoring successfully on the related AP Exam, students can:\n\nStand Out in College Admissions\n\tEarn College Credits\n\tSkip Introductory Classes\n\tBuild College Skills\nAdvanced Placement\u00ae and AP\u00ae are trademarks registered and/or owned by the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\n\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "AdvPHY2.1x: AP\u00ae Physics 2 - Part 1: Fluids and Thermodynamics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Reid Whitaker", "institution_name": ["Rice University"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/apr-physics-2-part-1-fluids-ricex-advphy2-1x-0", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
