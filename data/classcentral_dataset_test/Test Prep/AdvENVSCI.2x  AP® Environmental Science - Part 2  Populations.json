This course is Part 2 of our AP Environmental Science series designed to prepare you for the AP exam.\u00a0\n\nIn Part 2, you will learn about the populations that inhabit Earth. You will learn about population dynamics, the human population and sustainability. You will also examine land and water use. \u00a0\n\nAs you work through this course, you will find lecture videos taught by expert AP Environmental Science teachers, practice multiple choice questions and free response questions that are similar to what you will encounter on the AP exam and tutorial videos that show you step-by-step how to solve problems. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to take on the AP exam!\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis course is authorized as an Advanced Placement\u00ae (AP\u00ae) course by the AP Course Audit.
