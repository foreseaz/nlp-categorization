{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Psychology"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Success and happiness are what most of us chase for most of our lifetimes. Interestingly, however, little is taught in schools about how to achieve success beyond the academic measures.\r\nIncreasingly what is needed to succeed in one\u2019s life and career goes beyond the academic achievements. For example, beyond the entry threshold of the required skills and IQs for a given job, emotional intelligence is found to be responsible for 80% of the success of individuals.\r\nEmployers are seeking individuals who are self aware and able to manage themselves and their relationships with others. This is seldom taught at schools and individuals are not even aware of thisfact. This course offers an opportunity to work in a structured manner to define, discover and achieve success in a fun way working together with other students.\r\nThis course is offered as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to enable as many people as possible to cultivate traits, skills and habits that will lead them to achieving success and happiness. The course is a simple start of a lifelong journey of self improvement and development. The course is designed and delivered collaboratively by Dr Mushtak Al-Atabi from Taylor\u2019s University and Dr Jennifer DeBoer from MIT.\r\nCourse Structure\r\nWhat is Success?\r\nSuccess is often defined achieving one\u2019s goals.
