But not many of those ideas are based on science. That\u2019s where this course comes in.\n\n\u201cThe Science of Happiness\u201d is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley\u2019s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself\u2014the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, \u201cThe Science of Happiness\u201d offers students practical strategies for tapping into and nurturing their own happiness, including trying several research-backed activities that foster social and emotional well-being, and exploring how their own happiness changes along the way.\n\nThe course\u2019s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science fun and personal.\u00a0They\u2019ll be joined by world-renowned experts discussing themes like empathy, mindfulness, and gratitude\u2014experts including Barbara Fredrickson, Paul Ekman, Sonja Lyubomirsky, and Jon Kabat-Zinn.\u00a0Health professionals who register can earn\u00a0continuing education units\u00a0for their participation.\n\nConsider signing up for this course with a friend or group - tweet about your registration, share it on Facebook, and use the buddy system to stay on track.
