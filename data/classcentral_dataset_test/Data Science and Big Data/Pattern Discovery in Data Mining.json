Then dive into one subfield in data mining: pattern discovery. Learn in-depth concepts, methods, and applications of pattern discovery in data mining. We will also introduce methods for data-driven phrase mining and some interesting applications of pattern discovery. This course provides you the opportunity to learn skills and content to practice and engage in scalable pattern discovery methods on massive transactional data, discuss pattern evaluation measures, and study methods for mining diverse kinds of patterns, sequential patterns, and sub-graph patterns.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Pattern Discovery in Data Mining", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jiawei Han", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-patterns", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
