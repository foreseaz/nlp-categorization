They are talking about big data, data science, business intelligence, analytics, data mining and data visualisation, and there\u2019s an urgent need for people with the data skills to understand, interpret and communicate this information.\n\nIt\u2019s all about using statistical data to predict behaviours and extract insights about the real world. From businesses, governments and service organisations to researchers, data has become everybody\u2019s business.\n\nData to Insight provides an introduction to statistical data analysis for those new to the subject as well as those wanting a reminder and a fresh perspective.\n\nThe course focuses on data exploration and discovery, showing you what to look for in statistical data, however large it may be. We\u2019ll also teach you some of the limitations of data and what you can do to avoid being misled. We use data visualisations designed to teach you these skills quickly, and introduce you to the basic concepts you need to start understanding our world through data.\n\nOur goal is to help you learn to think like a statistician.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Data to Insight: An Introduction to Data Analysis", "price": 0, "instructors": "Chris Wild", "institution_name": ["University Of Auckland"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-to-insight?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
