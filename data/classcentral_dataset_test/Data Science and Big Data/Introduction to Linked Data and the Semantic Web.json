This helps the exposure and interlinking of datasets so that data can be exchanged, reused and integrated.\n\nOn this course you will learn the basics of Linked Data and the Semantic Web - exploring how this new Web of Data isn\u2019t about creating a big collection of standalone datasets, but is instead about using a common format to ensure data is interrelated.\n\nExplore why Linked Data is important\n\nThrough linking datasets, applications can vastly improve their user experience - thanks to having access to a wider range of knowledge.\n\nIncreasing numbers of organisations and initiatives are starting to appreciate the power of Linked Data. It provides significant power and potential to the growing domain of data science and web science.\n\nGet practical experience of Linked Data\n\nThis course will introduce you to the knowledge and skills around using Linked Data \u2013 skills that are in increasing demand as the Web evolves from a Web of Documents to a Web of Data.\n\nYou will learn how you can use Linked Data technologies and more than that you\u2019ll learn how to write queries in SPARQL, so you can use these technologies in your own work.\n\nLearn from industry leaders\n\nThe Web and Internet Science Group at the University of Southampton is playing a leading role in the European Data Science Academy (EDSA) project. This course is one of a number being produced by the project, and aims to provide you with an introduction to Linked Data that you can use to prepare for further training opportunities.\n\nOther University of Southampton web science-related courses are Web Science: How the Web is Changing the World and The Power of Social Media.\n\n(Course image: derivative work based on Businessman hand using mobile phone with digital layer effect as business strategy concept \u00a9 everything possible/Shutterstock.)\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Linked Data and the Semantic Web", "price": 0, "instructors": "Elena Simperl", "institution_name": ["University of Southampton"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/linked-data?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
