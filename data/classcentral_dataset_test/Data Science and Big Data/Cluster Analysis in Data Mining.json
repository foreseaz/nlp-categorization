This includes partitioning methods such as k-means, hierarchical methods such as BIRCH, and density-based methods such as DBSCAN/OPTICS. Moreover, learn methods for clustering validation and evaluation of clustering quality. Finally, see examples of cluster analysis in applications.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Cluster Analysis in Data Mining", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jiawei Han", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/cluster-analysis", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
