Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist\u2019s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Least Squares and Linear RegressionThis week, we focus on least squares and linear regression.Week 2: Linear Regression &amp; Multivariable RegressionThis week, we will work through the remainder of linear regression and then turn to the first part of  multivariable regression.Week 3: Multivariable Regression, Residuals, &amp; DiagnosticsThis week, we'll build on last week's introduction to multivariable regression with some examples and then cover residuals, diagnostics, variance inflation, and model comparison. Week 4: Logistic Regression and Poisson RegressionThis week, we will work on generalized linear models, including binary outcomes and Poisson regression. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Regression Models", "price": 0, "instructors": "Brian Caffo", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "4-9 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
