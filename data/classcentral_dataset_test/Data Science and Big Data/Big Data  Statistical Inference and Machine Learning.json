Many people have big data. But only some people know what to do with big data when they have it.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem? Well, the big problem is that the data is big\u2014the size, complexity and diversity of datasets increases every day. This means that we need new technological or methodological solutions for analysing data. There is a great demand for people with the skills and know-how to do big data analytics.\n\nExtract information from large datasets\n\nThis free online course equips you for working with these solutions by introducing you to selected statistical and machine learning techniques used for analysing large datasets and extracting information.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t teach everything in one course, so we have focused on giving an overview of a selection of common methods. You will become familiar with predictive analysis, dimension reduction, machine learning and clustering techniques. You will also discover how simple decision trees can help us make informed decisions and you can dive into statistical learning theory.\n\nExplore real-world big data problems\n\nThese methods will be described through case studies that explain how each is applied to solve real-world problems. You can also develop your coding skills by applying the techniques you\u2019ve just learnt to complete hands-on tasks and obtain results.\n\nJust as there are many statistical and machine learning methods for big data analytics, there are also many software packages (see \u2018Requirements\u2019 below) that can be used for this purpose. In this course, we will expose you to three such packages, so that you can start to become familiar with using different tools, and can gain confidence in going further with these packages or using others that may come your way.\n\nContinue learning with the Big Data Analytics program\n\nThis course is one of four in the Big Data Analytics program on FutureLearn from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).\n\nThe program enables you to understand how big data is collected and managed, before exploring statistical inference, machine learning, mathematical modelling and data visualisation.\n\nWhen you complete all four courses and buy a Certificate of Achievement for each, you will earn a FutureLearn Award as proof of completing the program of study.\n\nAcknowledgements\nQUT would like to thank the following content contributors:\n\n\n  Tomasz Bednarz\n  Amy Cook\n  Miles McBain\n  Kerrie Mengersen\n  Sam Rathmanner\n  Nan Ye\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Big Data: Statistical Inference and Machine Learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tomasz Bednarz, Ian Turner and Kerrie Mengersen", "institution_name": ["Queensland University of Technology"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/big-data-machine-learning?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
