There are some introductory ideas for those new to this field of study and practice. One of the features of the course will be the contributions experts in the field will make. The course has some exciting global connections to energise and develop.\r\nConsiderable emphasis will be placed on connecting with each other during the course. One of the key features of this course will be the encouragement of self-organising networks of discussion and sharing.\r\nThe course is planned as a non-linear course. Participants are invited to pursue their interests in whatever content and conversation they choose within the four themes in the course: introduction to informatics and analytics; pattern recognition; performance monitoring; and sharing data. Each of these themes will provide an opportunity for structured attention during the course.\r\nThis is an important time for those interested in the observation and analysis of sport performance. This course aims to contribute to the vibrant discussion of theory and practice in informatics and analytics in sport and through its invitational approach aspires to create an open access resource that contributes to ongoing discussion.\r\nCourse objectives include:\r\n\r\nexplore the relationships between informatics and analytics in sport contexts\r\nencourage open sharing of experiences of and practices in informatics and analytics in sport\r\ninvestigate pattern recognition in data with a supervised learning task\r\nshare technological innovation in the monitoring of performance\r\nconsider how analytics data are shared with different audiences with specific consideration of visualisation techniques\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Sport Informatics and Analytics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Keith Lyons", "institution_name": ["University of Canberra"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/ucanberra/courses/sport-informatics-and-analytics", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
