It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data \u201ctidy\u201d. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1In this first week of the course, we look at finding data and reading different file types.Week 2Welcome to Week 2 of Getting and Cleaning Data!
