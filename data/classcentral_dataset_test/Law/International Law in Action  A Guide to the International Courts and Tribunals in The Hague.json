The International Court of Justice (ICJ)This week we are going to explore the principle judicial organ of the United Nations\u2014the International Court of Justice. This Court has dual functions as an institution that settles disputes between States, and as an advice giver within the UN system. We will explore the limitations that the Court faces in its fulfilment of these functions as well as its potential as an institution, particularly in the context of disputes involving the protection of the environment.

More specifically, we will focus on the Permanent court of arbitration, inter-state arbitration and investor-state arbitration. Through our videos, you will discover the history and characteristics of arbitration and you will understand how its functioning is impacted by the dynamics at play within the international and domestic societies. You will also come to realize the importance of public interests in the disputes settled through arbitration and you will learn how they are taken into account in international arbitration.International Criminal Courts and TribunalsThis week examines a relatively new type of international courts, namely international criminal courts, with a focus on the ICC. We will discuss ongoing cases and debates, including sensitive issues such as the prosecution of sitting Heads of States. We will also inquire whether the international community is in need of a new dedicated international terrorism tribunal. Conclusions of the three Course ThemesThis week, we will directly focus on the three course themes that have structured our discussions in the previous modules: law and politics, state consent and global values. For each of these themes, the videos of this module will give you the opportunity to synthetize the knowledge that you have acquired over the course and to compare the various courts and tribunals that have been analyzed through the lenses of the course themes. The videos in this module will also offer you some concluding observations and insights which will stimulate you to continue to reflect on these three themes and the international courts in The Hague more generally. This week, you will also take the final exam of this course; good luck on this!\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "International Law in Action: A Guide to the International Courts and Tribunals in The Hague", "price": 0, "instructors": "Larissa Van den Herik, Yannick Radi and Cecily Rose", "institution_name": ["Leiden University"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/international-law-in-action", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
