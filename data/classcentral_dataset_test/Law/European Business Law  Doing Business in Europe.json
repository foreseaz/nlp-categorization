Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and regulations relevant to establishing and managing a company within the European Union, the course also explores business considerations within a broader perspective by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically, the course discusses strategic and financial considerations within Company law, as well as Labour law issues such as restructuring enterprises, working conditions and handling crises situations. The course also examines other legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.  The course is useful to persons both inside and outside the European Union, whether they are students, professionals, or simply interested in the European Union and/or European Business Law. The series is ideal for entrepreneurs and businessmen/women who plan to work or do business in a European context and want to sharpen their competitiveness. For lawyers it is a great course to take in order to refresh European Union law or to gain an understanding of law in the context of European business. Those preparing for a legal career will also benefit from the course as it gives a good understanding of European Union law while including lectures by some of the most leading academics and practitioners in the field.   Prior knowledge of law and the European Union is an advantage, but not a prerequisite. If you have taken our introductory course on Understanding the EU Fundamentals you might however have a bit of head start.  About the Series  The Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.  We are currently working on the third course in the series, and it will be launched in September 2016.

The Faulty of Law is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. The university offers two international Masters: European Business Law and Human Rights Law. The former provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers.   Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty\u2019s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university\u2019s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "European Business Law: Doing Business in Europe", "price": 0, "instructors": "C\u00e9cile Brokelind, Julian Nowag, Hans Henrik Lidgard, Michael Bogdan, Henrik Norinder, , Mia R\u00f6nnmar , Xavier Groussot and Sanja Bogojevi \u0107", "institution_name": ["Lund University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/eu-law-doing-business", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
