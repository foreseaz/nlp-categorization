It derives Prandtl\u2019s Boundary Layer Equations for laminar boundary layers from the basic Navier-Stokes equations and discusses their exact solutions. It discusses how a laminar boundary layer transitions to turbulence and separates. It also discusses thermal boundary layers.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Introduction to spectroscopic methods \u2013 Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), spin \u00bd nuclei, 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, FT-NMR method.
