We will specifically focus on topics of interaction of the simulation models with the real world using Arduino Microcontrollers and Simulink\u00ae's corresponding Arduino Support Package.First, we will explain modelling and simulation concepts in general and introduce Simulink\u00ae. As a first application, we show how a simplified model of a Water Treatment Plant is implemented using Simulink\u00ae. We will then use an Arduino microcontroller to access hardware in the real world. We will go on to introduce control engineering techniques using Simulink\u00ae and apply these techniques to drive an example system of a ball floating in an airstream.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Chapter 1: My first Simulink\u00ae modelChapter 2: Advanced Simulink\u00ae modellingChapter 3: Modelling a Water Treatment PlantChapter 4: The Arduino microcontroller and the corresponding Simulink\u00ae support packageChapter 5: Control Engineering using Simulink\u00aeChapter 6: Control Engineering using the Arduino\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Modelling and Simulation using Simulink", "price": 0, "instructors": "Georg Fries, Patrick Metzler and Peter Dannenmann", "institution_name": ["RheinMain University of Applied Sciences"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://iversity.org/en/courses/modelling-and-simulation-using-simulink-may-2016", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["iversity"], "start_date": "2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
