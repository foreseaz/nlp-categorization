You\u2019ll develop skills in linear and quadratic functions, general polynomial functions, rational functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions. You will also study systems of linear equations. This course will emphasize problem-solving techniques, specifically by means of discussing concepts in each of these topics.\n\nContent in this course will be adaptive, allowing you to achieve mastery in a certain concept before moving on to the next. Utilizing the ALEKS learning system, students in this personalized, self-paced course will be instructed on the topics they are most ready to learn while also providing individualized coaching as you move through each topic.\n\nThis 3 credit hour course satisfies the Mathematical Studies (MA) general studies requirement at Arizona State University. This course may satisfy a general education requirement at other institutions; however, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "MAT117x: College Algebra and Problem Solving", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sue McClure and Adrian Sannier", "institution_name": ["Arizona State University"], "commitment": "18 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/college-algebra-problem-solving-asux-mat117x", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
