Topics include a review of arithmetic, introductory algebra, rudiments of analytic geometry, elementary trigonometry, introductory statistics, and basic finance. Module warm-up questions will help students identify learning deficits, which can then be addressed through the modules. This course also contextualizes math for trades, including electro-mechanical, engineering graphics, machining, and welding. Students who choose to master every short module quiz will be awarded a certificate of completion.\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nModule One:\u00a0Numbers, Conversions and Measurements\r\nModule Two:\u00a0Algebra Essentials\r\nModule Three:\u00a0Geometry\r\nModule Four:\u00a0Trigonometry, Vectors and Logarithms\r\nModule Five:\u00a0Concepts in Finance, Statistics and Graphing\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Technical Math for Industry ", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lindsey Small", "institution_name": ["Colorado Community College System"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/cccs/courses/technical-math-for-industry-7", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
