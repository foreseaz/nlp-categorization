This course will start at the very beginnings of geometry, answering questions like \"How big is an angle?\" and \"What are parallel lines?\" and proceed up through advanced theorems and proofs about 2D and 3D shapes. Along the way, you'll learn a few different ways to find the area of a triangle, you'll discover a shortcut for counting the number of stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza, and you'll even come up with your own estimate for the size of the Earth.\n\u00a0\nIn this course, you'll be able to choose your own path within each lesson, and you can jump between lessons to quickly review earlier material. GeometryX covers a standard curriculum in high school geometry, and CCSS (common core) alignment is indicated where applicable.\n\nLearn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\nThis course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2019-07-05T00:00:00Z", "title": "GeometryX: Introduction to Geometry", "price": 0, "instructors": "Zach Wissner-Gross", "institution_name": ["Schoolyourself"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-geometry-schoolyourself-geometryx-1", "duration": "157 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
