For 6 weeks, participants will submerge themselves in the world of public speaking analyzing famous speeches through TED videos, political interventions or business gurus), will work on their individual weak spots, and improve drastically while having fun. Moreover, you\u2019ll have the ability to put your learnings in practice during the 1st Elevator Pitch Contest, which will be held in Spring 2015 in Barcelona!\r\nWhat do I learn?\r\nThe course enables participants to learn tricks and tips to enhance their presentations and therefore feel comfortable while presenting.
