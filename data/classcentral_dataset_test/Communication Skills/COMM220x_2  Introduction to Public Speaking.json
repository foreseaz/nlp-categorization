Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.\n\nThis course is designed to help you become a more effective and confident public speaker. We will demystify the process of writing, practicing, and performing a clear and engaging speech, work through the unique traits of oral versus written communication, and learn how to prepare speeches that are easier to deliver orally and understand aurally.\n\nOne of the best ways to refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches. We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers, we will discuss who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker effective. We will critically examine our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public speaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient Greece.\n\nThis course is adapted from a similar class offered by the Bachelor of Arts in Integrated Social Sciences, a fully online degree completion program from the University of Washington.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-06-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "COMM220x_2: Introduction to Public Speaking", "price": 0, "instructors": "Matt McGarrity", "institution_name": ["University of Washington"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Personal Development"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-public-speaking-uwashingtonx-comm220x2", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
