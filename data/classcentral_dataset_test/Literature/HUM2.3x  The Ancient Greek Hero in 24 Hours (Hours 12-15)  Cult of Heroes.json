The third of five modules in The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours, \u201cHours 12-15: Cult of Heroes\u201d explores the vast variety of perspectives brought to bear on\u00a0the idea of the\u00a0ancient Greek hero in the versatile medium of prose, as exemplified by authors\u00a0as varied\u00a0as Herodotus, the so-called father of history, and Philostratus, an\u00a0intellectual from a post-classical period\u00a0who was prodigiously well-versed in classical\u00a0and pre-classical lore about cult heroes.\n\nIn\u00a0Homeric poetry the idea of hero cult is implicit even though\u00a0characters like Odysseus are not\u00a0explicitly identified as cult heroes. The\u00a0situation is different, however, in the poetry attributed to Hesiod,\u00a0where the\u00a0very idea of a cult hero is precisely outlined and illustrated, especially in\u00a0the myth about the five\u00a0generations of humankind. As we will see from\u00a0the lively prose\u00a0narratives of such learned and captivating authors as Herodotus and Philostratus, the mystique of cult heroes,\u00a0both male\u00a0and female, enthralled their adoring worshippers, who treasured the exotic\u00a0stories of epiphanies and\u00a0miracles that were linked with the places made sacred\u00a0by the felt presence of heroes residing in the\u00a0mother earth that concealed\u00a0their bodies. We will even get the chance to read and analyze an\u00a0eyewitness prose account of an actual initiation into the mysteries of a hero cult.\u00a0This prose account\u00a0brings home to us the seriousness of personally experiencing\u00a0such an initiation, and it shows the\u00a0emotional impact of making contact with\u00a0the consciousness of superhuman forces that inhabit the\u00a0mystical world of hero\u00a0cult.\n\nSee other courses in this series:Module 1, \u201cHours 1-5: Epic and Lyric\u201dModule 2, \u201cHours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography\u201dModule 4, \u201cHours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy\u201dModule 5, \u201cHours 22-24: Plato and Beyond\u201d\n\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.
