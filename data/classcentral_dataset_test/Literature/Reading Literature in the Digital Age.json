Only rarely do we actually reflect this process: what are the means that help us to understand literary texts? How does interpretation work? And how has our increasing use of e-books and tablets changed the way we read and interpret literature?\n\nThis free online course addresses these key questions as it introduces you to a variety of ways of interpreting literary texts. We will look into time-tested methods such as close reading and historical contextualisation. We shall also address more recent, computer-assisted practices such as distant reading.\n\nDo we read differently on e-books, tablets and mobiles?\n\nYou will learn about the professional reading practices used by literary scholars. But we will also  probe the benefits and limitations of the screen-based reading all of us perform every day as we move from hyperlink to hyperlink.\n\nAlong the way, we will inquire into the materiality of texts, asking ourselves what difference it makes whether we encounter a poem, play or novel as an e-book, paperback, hardback or manuscript.\n\nWhile we will take a modern American poem as our tutor text, you will encounter a great variety of literary texts and forms. We will also visit the rich library holdings of the University of Basel, one of the world\u2019s 50 oldest universities.\n\nJoin us in this treasure hunt for meaning\n\nThrough the course, you will become acquainted with established, professional reading practices as well as newer, computer-driven reading techniques. As you reflect and discuss your own reading processes, you will also  discover unexpected approaches, getting a cutting-edge introduction to what it means to read literature in the digital age.\n\nYou will learn how to uncover the hidden treasures in literary texts, including a well-known poem by Ezra Pound, and follow the educator as he chases the clues pointing to a mysterious connection between this American poet and Basel.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "Reading Literature in the Digital Age", "price": 0, "instructors": "Philipp Schweighauser", "institution_name": ["University of Basel"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/reading-digital?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
