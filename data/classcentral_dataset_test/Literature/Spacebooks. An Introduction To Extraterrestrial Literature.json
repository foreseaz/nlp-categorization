The human mind was sent on a journey to visit other planets \u2013 and time after time it returned from there with breathtaking news, disturbing images or philosophical insight. And, of course, with a lot of questions: Why funeral customs on the Moon include cannibalism and orgies? Is it true that the people of Mars do live according to higher moral standards than we do? And where does this weird alien obsession with terrestrial paper actually come from?These are some of the questions we will be addressing within this course. Moreover, we will watch the birth of the alien reader, we will explore the logics of space invasion and the history of space colonies well. We will examine the inventory of extraterrestrial libraries and survey the competing projects of galactic encyclopedias. Next to well-known authors as Kepler, Cyrano de Bergerac, Stapledon or Lem, you will also be introduced to neglected and forgotten texts. Finally, we might even understand how literature itself was transformed by this journey throughout the universe \u2013 and how it finally became a true interstellar medium.The soundtrack to this MOOC will be provided by Swiss artists\u00a0Bit-Tuner\u00a0and\u00a0Darkspace.Keywords: Science Fiction, Sci-Fi, Extraterrestrial Literature, Spacebooks  \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL LITERATURE?Main Source: Jonathan Swift, Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. \nBy Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships (1727), Part III, Chapters 1-3.MODULE I: CONSTRUCTING OTHER WORLDSLearning objective: Literature is not a interstellar medium of a second\norder, but organizes outer space as we see it.Main Source: Johannes Kepler, The dream, or a lunar astronomy (1609/1634)\n\nLesson 1: The Book And The Telescope - Kepler vs. GalileiLesson 2: The Demon And The Mind's Eye - Kepler's \"Dream\"MODULE II: TRAVELLING THE EARLY MODERN COSMOSLearning objective: The early-modern age reflects interstellar\ntravelling as a journey made possible by literature and literary imagination.Main Sources: Francis Godwin, The Man in the Moone (1629/1638)\u00a0 / Cyrano de Bergerac, The Other World: Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (1657) Lesson 3: Godwin or The Secret Passage Of FantasyLesson 4: Cyrano or The Universe As A Literary MarketMODULE III: THE 18TH CENTURY ALIEN\n\nLearning objective: The idea of an inhabited solar system evokes a\ncosmical hierarchy of morals.\u00a0 \n\nMain Sources: Eberhard Christian Kindermann, The Speedy Journey (1744) / Immanuel Kant, Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven (1755), Part Three, paragraphs 1-12 / Emanuel Swedenborg, Earths In The Universe (1758), Passages 27-29.Lesson 5: The Golden Chain Of The Cosmos - Kindermann's Trip To The Martian MoonLesson 6: Kant, Swedenborg, And The Nature Of The Alien ReaderMODULE IV: READING MARSLearning objective: The Age of the Martians is linked to the galactic\nexpansion of evolutionary theory.\n\nMain Sources: Kurd Lasswitz, Two Planets (1897) / H.G.

While the superficial\nnotion of space fiction registers a vivid tradition of sexist clich\u00e9s, outer\nspace is in fact a fertile ground for diversive concepts of sexual identity.Main Sources: Pulp / Donna Haraway, Monkeys, Aliens, and Women: Love, Science, and Politics at the Intersection of Feminist Theory and Colonial Discourse(1989)Lesson 9: The Cosmos Of PulpLesson 10: The Gender Of SpaceMODULE VI: EMPIRE - OUTER SPACE AS A POLITICAL BATTLEGROUNDLearning objective: As outer space becomes an arena of political\nconflicts, wars become an integral element of space fiction. However: The emergence of the Galactic Empire shows us that space politics have less to do with enemies and warfare than with control and communication. Main Sources: Robert A.
