Permaculture design is a method of landscape planning that can be applied to anything, from a home garden or farm to a city block or entire village. Permaculture uses design principles from nature itself and takes into account such things as how indigenous people used the land. This course is designed to benefit everyone regardless of learning style, time commitments, or available technology. Expect to spend between two to four hours each week on coursework.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDefine what the permaculture design system is, as well as its ethics and principles.\r\nOrganize the order of the permaculture design process.\r\nDiagram elements of watershed, sector, and zone maps.\r\nIdentify design elements appropriate for each climate.\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Intro to Permaculture Design", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Oregon State University"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/oregonstate/courses/permaculture-design-2", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
