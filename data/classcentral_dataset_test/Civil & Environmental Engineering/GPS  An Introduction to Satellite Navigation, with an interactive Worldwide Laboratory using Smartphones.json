This course will teach you the fundamentals of how GPS works and introduce you to the diverse range of uses of satellite navigation\u2014in all aspects of our lives.Through vivid online lectures and a set of \"backyard experiments\" enabled by the widespread availability of GPS-enabled smart phones and tablets, students will be able to connect online learning to real-\u00adworld experience. Even those who do not own laptop or desktop computers can take part; they will be able to view lectures and completing labs via mobile device only.We hope students will enjoy the interactive nature of the course, while gaining knowledge that benefits their personal and professional lives.
