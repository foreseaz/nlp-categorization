Are we still in modernity, or have we moved beyond the modern to the postmodern?\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course Pages \u201cThe Modern and the Postmodern Part I\u201d covers the first half of a full semester course on European history, literature and philosophy. We begin with Immanuel Kant and Jean Jacques Rousseau and conclude with Friedrich Nietzsche and Charles Baudelaire and a very quick look at painting at the time they wrote. Although in the final week themes of postmodernism begin to emerge, a discussion of how modernism becomes postmodernism is at the heart of Part II of this course.Philosophy, Modernity, and Intellectual HistoryWhy is philosophy relevant to modernity?\n\nThrough reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant, we examine philosophy as a reflection on modernity and progress.What is Enlightenment?Using Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, we study how the pursuit of knowledge is related to the politics of inequality.From Enlightenment to RevolutionKarl Marx is our focus here as we move from a consideration of ideas to a confrontation with alienation, class struggle and revolution.Modernism and Art for Art's SakeWe read Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary as a reflection on convention, stupidity and art in the wake of the failures of mid-19th century revolution.Re-imagining the WorldWe situate Charles Darwin\u2019s great achievement in the context of the English Enlightenment traditions and reimaging the world without a goal for change.From Struggle to IntensityThrough an examination of Charles Baudelaire and Friedrich Nietzsche, we focus on an aesthetic embrace of intensity instead of search for the \u201creally real.\u201dPaintingsA Quick Survey of how advanced painting moved toward a consideration of the surface of the canvas and away from a quest for the most realistic representation of the world.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Modern and the Postmodern (Part 1)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael S.
