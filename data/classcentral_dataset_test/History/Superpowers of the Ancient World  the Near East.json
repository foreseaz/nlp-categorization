We will see how they came into contact with each other in their efforts to extend their influence into the ever-contested Syria-Palestine lands.\n\nWe will examine objects from the University of Liverpool\u2019s Garstang Museum of Archaeology - one of the most important collections of artefacts in the UK - enabling you to learn not only about the history of this period, but also how experts use artefacts to reconstruct the past.\n\nUsing the present to illuminate the past\n\nThe archaeological evidence that we will consult is often disparate and fragmentary, so in order to understand it better, we will look into current approaches to international relations and discuss modern parallels with an expert from our Department of Politics.\n\nAccessing ancient landscapes\n\nOur experts will familiarise you with the ancient Near-Eastern landscapes and introduce you to key objects that featured in diplomacy and warfare at this time in the distant past.\n\nYou will also consider the bigger picture, as empires prospered and floundered in the struggle to become the main superpower of the ancient Near East.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Superpowers of the Ancient World: the Near East", "price": 0, "instructors": "Glenn Godenho", "institution_name": ["University of Liverpool"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/superpowers-near-east?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
