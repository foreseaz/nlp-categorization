Central to the account are the road to emancipation, the role of black soldiers, the nature of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime leadership, internal dissent in both the North and South, the changing position of women in both societies, and the war\u2019s long-term economic and intellectual impact.\u00a0We end with a look at the beginnings of Reconstruction during the conflict.\n\nThis course is part of the XSeries, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery.\u00a0It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation \u2013 the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality.\u00a0This XSeries will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history \u2013 how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "HIST1.2x: The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1861 - 1865: A New Birth of Freedom", "price": 0, "instructors": "Eric Foner", "institution_name": ["Columbia University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/civil-war-reconstruction-1861-1865-new-columbiax-hist1-2x", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
