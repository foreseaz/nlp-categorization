As civilized human beings, we fail to understand how events of such horror could have taken place, and how an idea so inhumanly warped could have spread like wildfire through an entire continent, instigating the systematic annihilation of millions of Jews.\n\nThis free online course was produced jointly by Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem \u2013 the World Center for Holocaust Research. This course is the second of the two courses and covers three themes in its three weeks:\n\nWeek 1: The Final Solution\nWe\u2019ll look at the cultural and mental processes that paved the way to the comprehensive and systematic mass murder of Jews in Europe \u2013 that is, the Final Solution. As part of this hard lesson we will discuss the various characteristics of the murder sites and death camps, and reveal selected aspects of the horror that occurred in them.\n\nWeek 2: Jewish and Non-Jewish Responses to the Holocaust\nWe will try to explore questions regarding knowledge about the application of the Final Solution, as well as a variety of responses and annihilation of victims, local populations and perpetrators.\n\nWeek 3: The End of the War\nWe will dedicate this lesson to the events that occurred in the last years of the Holocaust, as well as questions of memory, commemoration and future research.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you register for The Holocaust: an Introduction - Part 1 as well. Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about The Holocaust.\n\nThis online course is offered in an innovative, multi-level format, comprising:\n\nComprehensive lectures by leading researchers from Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem.\nA wealth of voices and viewpoints presented by guest lecturers.\nNumerous documents, photos, testimonies and works of art from the time of the Holocaust.\nNovel learning experience: Crowdsourcing \u2013 involving the learners themselves in the act of collecting and shaping information, via unique, exciting online assignments.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Holocaust: an Introduction - Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Inbar Bondy, Dr Na'ama Bela Shik and Dr. Havi Dreifuss", "institution_name": ["Tel Aviv University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/holocaust-part-2?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
