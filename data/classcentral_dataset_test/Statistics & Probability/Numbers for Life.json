These lessons will develop your understanding of common numbers often found in the news, on advertisements, and online. You will see how numbers play important roles in arguments you hear about daily like issues such as gun control, smoking, pollution, and heart attacks. And by the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to use numbers to communicate your ideas.\r\nThe format of this course is probably not like other math courses you\u2019ve taken. Instead, the Quantway\u00ae course was developed using principles that have been shown in research studies to be important in better developing students\u2019 understanding of the material. One of these key principles is Productive Struggle. In short this means that to learn something you must try it out AND stick with it even when it gets challenging!\r\nThe goal of the Quantway\u00ae is to help you learn things that you can actually use in life--not so you can memorize it for a test and then forget it. In fact, by the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to create a final project that uses numbers to prove a point to anyone who sees it. Given the large number of students enrolled in this class, that\u2019s a lot of people! We are all learning together and helping each other along the way.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-11-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Numbers for Life", "price": 0, "instructors": "Cinnamon Hillyard and Karon Klipple", "institution_name": ["Carnegie Foundation"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/numbers-life-quantway", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2013-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
