These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this module, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        About Linear Regression and ModelingThis short module introduces basics about Coursera specializations and courses in general, this specialization: Statistics with R, and this course: Linear Regression and Modeling. Please take several minutes to browse them through. Thanks for joining us in this course!Linear RegressionIn this week we\u2019ll introduce linear regression. Many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables. More about Linear RegressionWelcome to week 2! In this week, we will look at outliers, inference in linear regression and variability partitioning. Please use this week to strengthen your understanding on linear regression. Don't forget to post your questions, concerns and suggestions in the discussion forum!Multiple RegressionIn this week, we\u2019ll explore multiple regression, which allows us to model numerical response variables using multiple predictors (numerical and categorical). We will also cover inference for multiple linear regression, model selection, and model diagnostics. Hope you enjoy!Final ProjectIn this week you will use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question. Please read the background information, review the report template (downloaded from the link in Lesson Project Information), and then complete the peer review assignment. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Linear Regression and Modeling ", "price": 0, "instructors": "Mine \u00c7etinkaya-Rundel", "institution_name": ["Duke University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-model", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
