{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Economics"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Energy issues have always been important in international relations, but in recent years may have become even more important than in the past due to the widespread awareness of existing limits to energy sources and negative climate impacts. The course discusses global trends in energy consumption and production, various available scenarios for potential developments in the coming decades, the availability of oil reserves and the evolution of the oil industry. It then discusses natural gas and highlights the differences between oil and gas. It will also discuss renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and EU energy policy.\n\nThe course aims at providing students whose main interest is in international relations a background on energy resources, technology and economic realities to allow them to correctly interpret the political impact of current developments. It also aims at providing students, who already have a technical background in energy science or engineering, with the broad global view of energy issues that will allow them to better understand the social, economic and political impact of their technical knowledge.\n\n\nABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR :\n\nGiacomo Luciani\n\nScientific Advisor for the Master in International Energy at the Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) Sciences Po, Giacomo Luciani is also Adjunct Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva and Director of the Executive Master in International Oil and Gas Leadership. For the period 2010-13 he was appointed Princeton University Global Scholar, attached to the Woodrow Wilson School and the Department of Near Eastern Studies. His research focuses on the political economy of the Middle East and North Africa and on global energy issues.\n\nRECOMMENDED BACKGROUND :\n\nThe course requires no special scientific, mathematical or economic background; all key concepts are clearly and elementarily explained. It is expected that it will be of interest to undergraduate and graduate students in schools where an equivalent course is not offered (this being the case for the vast majority of schools).\n\n\nUSPC\nSorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9\nSupported by Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9\n\n\nIDEX\nInvestissements d'Avenir\nFunded by Investissements d'Avenir - 'ANR.\n\nInfo : \nCourse content : Licence Creative Commons BY NC SA\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                         Week #1 : Introduction to global energy trends and scenariosThis module presents the Introduction to global energy consumption, Energy scenarios, Energy transition and povertyWeek #2 : Oil formation, exploration and productionThis module presents the Introduction to oil formation and exploration, Oil extraction methods, Environmental management in oil productionWeek #3 : Global oil reserves and resourcesThis module presents the Introduction to liquid fuels, Definition and issues about oil reserves, Oil production and the impact of non-conventional oilWeek #4 : The economics of natural gasThis module presents the Introduction to natural gas, The international gas market, New gas developments Week #5 : The geopolitics of natural gasThis module presents the Introduction to geopolitics of gas, Geopolitics in the Far and Near EstWeek#6 : Renewable energy sourcesThis module presents the Introduction to renewable energy, Types of renewable energy, Renewable energy integration, Energy efficiency\nWeek #7 : Nuclear EnergyThis module presents the Introduction to Nuclear Energy, Nuclear Energy for electricity generation, Safety of Nuclear EnergyWeek #8 : Dilemmas of (European) energy policyThis module presents the Introduction to energy policy, The three pillars of EU energy policy\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "Politics and Economics of International Energy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Giacomo Luciani", "institution_name": ["Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-energy", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
