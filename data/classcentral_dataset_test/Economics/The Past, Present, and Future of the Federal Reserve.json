The System has played a pivotal role in shaping the American economy and financial system, stretching from the Great Depression of the 1930s, the spiraling inflation of the 1970s, and most recently to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.\r\nFrank Sesno, former anchor and Washington Bureau Chief for CNN, serves as the course moderator, joined by a team of top professors of finance, law, political science, and history to shed light on one of the most powerful, yet widely misunderstood, institutions in the world today. Lectures and interviews with key Federal Reserve figures such as former chairs Ben Bernanke and Paul Volcker enrich the course and provide you with special insight into the Fed\u2019s approaches and policies over the years.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "The Past, Present, and Future of the Federal Reserve", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["George Washington University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://mooc.online.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GWX+101x+2015__04/about", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
