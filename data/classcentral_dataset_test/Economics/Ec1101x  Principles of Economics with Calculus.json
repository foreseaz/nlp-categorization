Examples of applications include predicting the impact of technological changes in market prices, calculating the optimal gasoline tax, and measuring the value of new products. This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, makes extensive use of calculus, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Ec1101x: Principles of Economics with Calculus", "price": 0, "instructors": "Antonio Rangel", "institution_name": ["California Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "9 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/principles-economics-calculus-caltechx-ec1101x-0", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
