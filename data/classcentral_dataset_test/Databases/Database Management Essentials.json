{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Databases"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Database Management Essentials provides the foundation you need for a career in database development, data warehousing, or business intelligence, as well as for the entire Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence specialization. In this course, you will create relational databases, write SQL statements to extract information to satisfy business reporting requests, create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design databases, and analyze table designs for excessive redundancy. As you develop these skills, you will use either Oracle or MySQL to execute SQL statements and a database diagramming tool such as the ER Assistant to create ERDs. We\u2019ve designed this course to ensure a common foundation for specialization learners. Everyone taking the course can jump right in with writing SQL statements in Oracle or MySQL.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Course IntroductionModule 1 provides the context for Database Management Essentials. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll understand the objectives for the course and know what topics and assignments to expect. Keeping these course objectives in mind will help you succeed throughout the course! You should read about the database software requirements in the last lesson of module 1. I recommend that you try to install the DBMS software this week before assignments begin in week 2.Introduction to Databases and DBMSsWe\u2019ll launch into an exploration of databases and database technology and their impact on organizations in Module 2. We\u2019ll investigate database characteristics, database technology features, including non-procedural access, two key processing environments, and an evolution of the database software industry. This short informational module will ensure that we all have the same background and context, which is critical for success in the later modules that emphasize details and hands-on skills.\nRelational Data Model and the CREATE TABLE StatementNow that you have the informational context for database features and environments, you\u2019ll start building! In this module, you\u2019ll learn relational data model terminology, integrity rules, and the CREATE TABLE statement. You\u2019ll apply what you\u2019ve learned in practice and graded problems using a database management system (DBMS), either Oracle or MySQL, creating tables using the SQL CREATE TABLE statement and populating your tables using given SQL INSERT statements.\nBasic Query Formulation with SQLThis module is all about acquiring query formulation skills. Now that you know the relational data model and have basic skills with the CREATE TABLE statement, we can cover basic syntax of the SQL SELECT statement and the join operator for combining tables. SELECT statement examples are presented for single table conditions, join operations, and grouping operations. You\u2019ll practice writing simple SELECT statements using the tables that you created in the assignment for module 3.\nExtended Query Formulation with SQLNow that you can identify and use the SELECT statement and the join operator, you\u2019ll extend your problem solving skills in this module so you can gain confidence on more complex queries. You will work on retrieval problems with multiple tables and grouping. In addition, you\u2019ll learn to use the UNION operator in the SQL SELECT statement and write SQL modification statements.\nNotation for Entity Relationship DiagramsModule 6 represents another shift in your learning. In previous modules, you\u2019ve created and populated tables and developed query formulation skills using the SQL SELECT statement. Now you\u2019ll start to develop skills that allow you to create a database design to support business requirements. You\u2019ll learn basic notation used in entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), a graphical notation for data modeling. You will create simple ERDs using basic diagram symbols and relationship variations to start developing your data modeling skills. \nERD Rules and Problem SolvingModule 7 builds on your knowledge of database development using basic ERD symbols and relationship variations. We\u2019ll be practicing precise usage of ERD notation and basic problem solving skills. You will learn about diagram rules and work problems to help you gain confidence using and creating ERDs.\nDeveloping Business Data ModelsIn Module 8, you\u2019ll use your ERD notation skills and your ability to avoid diagram errors to develop ERDs that satisfy specific business data requirements. You will learn and practice powerful problem-solving skills as you analyze narrative statements and transformations to generate alternative ERDs.\nData Modeling Problems and Completion of an ERDNow that you have practiced data modeling techniques, you\u2019ll get to wrestle with narrative problem analyses and transformations for generating alternative database designs in Module 9. At the end of this module, you\u2019ll learn guidelines for documentation and detection of design errors that will serve you well as you design databases for business situations.\nSchema ConversionModules 6 to 9 covered conceptual data modeling, emphasizing precise usage of ERD notation, analysis of narrative problems, and generation of alternative designs. Modules 10 and 11 cover logical database design, the next step in the database development process. In Module 10, we\u2019ll cover schema conversion, the first step in the logical database design phase. You will learn to convert an ERD into a table design that can be implemented on a relational DBMS.\nNormalization Concepts and PracticeModule 11 covers normalization, the second part of the logical database design process. Normalization provides tools to remove unwanted redundancy in a table design. You\u2019ll discover the motivation for normalization, constraints to reason about unwanted redundancy, and rules that detect excessive redundancy in a table design. You\u2019ll practice integrating and applying normalization techniques in the final lesson of this course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Database Management Essentials", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Mannino", "institution_name": ["University of Colorado System"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
