We will then introduce Galaxy, describe what the Galaxy framework is, and look at different ways you can use it.Galaxy 101In this module and the following modules we will start to use Galaxy to perform different types of analysis. Working with sequence dataIn this module we will be studying sequence data quality control as well as ChIP-Sequence Analysis with MACS.RNA-seq &amp; Running your own GalaxyIn these final modules, we'll take a look at working with sequence data and RNA-seq and at installing and running your own Galaxy.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Genomic Data Science with Galaxy", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Taylor", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
