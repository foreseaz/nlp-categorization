This doesn't have to be the case. At Acumen, we believe leaders should have the audacity to imagine the world as it could be AND the humility to recognize that they cannot change the world alone. To tackle the world's toughest problems, you need collaboration from people across your network and across sectors.\r\nIn this 4 hour course from +Acumen and the Center for Creative Leadership, you'll complete interactive diagnostic activities that will help you and your team unearth the social capital &amp; relationships that you bring to the table. You'll be exposed to new data visualization tools for mapping your network; learn about 5 network traps to avoid that are particularly common to the social sector; and, most importantly, gain concrete strategies for building genuinely collaborative relationships.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "Networking Leadership 101: Building Your Core Professional Network", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "1 hours", "subject_name": ["Personal Development"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/networking-changemakers-2016-2", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
