Assessing the reasons we are given to do or believe these things calls upon us to think critically and logically.\n\nImprove your logical and critical thinking skills\n\nEven though we\u2019re called upon to use our critical and logical thinking skills all the time, most of us are not that good at it. This free online course aims to help you develop and improve these skills.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to:\n\n\n  identify and avoid common thinking mistakes that lead to the formation of bad beliefs;\n  recognise, reconstruct and evaluate arguments;\n  use basic logical tools to analyse arguments;\n  and apply those tools in areas including science, moral theories and law.\n\n\nAssociate Professor Tim Dare and Dr Patrick Girard from the University of Auckland take us on an informative and engaging eight week journey through the worlds of logical and critical thinking helping us to avoid these common obstacles and fallacies and improve our logical and critical thinking skills.\n\nThroughout the course, Tim and Patrick provide videos, articles, and assignments to lead us through the thickets of logical and critical thinking.\n\nWe will spend the first half of the course exploring key concepts in logical and critical thinking. In the second half of the course, we will apply those concepts in familiar areas, to help you develop practical and useful logical and critical thinking skills.\n\nWe begin, in the first week, with an introduction to logical and critical thinking and common obstacles and fallacies.\n\nIn week two Patrick introduces arguments.  We learn to identify premises and conclusions \u2013 components of a good argument \u2013 and by the end of this week we\u2019ll be able to construct an argument in standard form.\n\nIn week three we will learn how to distinguish between deductive and non-deductive arguments and about validity, invalidity, strength and weakness.\n\nIn week four we examine good and bad arguments in more detail, learning how to tell when an argument is sound or cogent, and how to evaluate an argument.\n\nWeeks five to seven examine three familiar areas \u2013 science, law, and morality \u2013 that call upon our logical and critical thinking skills in ways appropriate to the particular demands of those areas.\n\nFinally in week eight we will apply the lessons of the course to an argument \u201cin the wild\u201d, seeing how the skills we have developed over our eight-week journey can be used in our own lives.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have acquired the basic skills to assess arguments logically and critically, and so to be in a better situation to own the reasons for your beliefs.\n\nYou can find out more in Patrick\u2019s post for the FutureLearn blog: \u201cWhat can the New Zealand flag teach us about logical and critical thinking?\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Logical and Critical Thinking", "price": 0, "instructors": "Patrick Girard and Tim Dare", "institution_name": ["University Of Auckland"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Personal Development"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/logical-and-critical-thinking?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
