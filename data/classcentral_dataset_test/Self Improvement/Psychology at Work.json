It is fair to say work is a highly significant part of our lives. How do we find a job that suits us? How do we carry out our work in a productive way? How do we keep ourselves motivated and engaged at work? How can we effectively design work for other people?\n\nIf you have been thinking about at least some of these questions, then this course is for you. In this course, you will learn how to use psychology to understand and improve the work life of yourself and those around you. We will be looking at key topic areas in work psychology that affect people's performance and well-being at work, including: individual differences in personality and cognitive ability; motivation at work; teamwork; leadership; work design and occupational health and safety. Collectively, these topics give you a broad understanding about work psychology both from an individual perspective and from a group-based and organisational perspective.  \n\nEach week, you will meet one or two world-leading professors in the field of work psychology. The professors will take you through the journey by introducing current theories and research evidence in respective topic areas. You will have lots of opportunities to engage in self-reflections and group discussions; you will also be given several self-assessments that help you understand your own psychological attributes and work characteristics.\n\nWelcome to Psychology at Work and we wish you all the best in this learning journey!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                         Welcome and Module 1: Individual DifferenceWelcome to Psychology at Work!  In the first module, we start from the concept of individual differences at work. In particular, we look at two individual difference factors - cognitive ability and personality, to understand how they affect our work behaviours and performance. We also briefly look at how to use our knowledge in individual differences to make better personnel selection decisions. Module 2: Work MotivationIn this module, we look at another individual difference factor at work: employee motivation. We discuss what motivation is, and how to motivate ourselves as well as others at work. We also look at different types of motivations and how they affect our work behaviours and performance. Module 3: TeamworkIn this week, we look beyond individuals to learn about teams. We discuss why we need teams, how to make teams effective, and how to manage the challenges of working in teams, such as conflicts. We also discuss the implications of team diversity and how it can be used to overcome conflicts and improve team effectiveness.Module 4: LeadershipWhen we work together in teams, we often need leaders. In this week, we discuss the concept of leadership, and two important yet distinct aspects of leadership: who tends to emerge as leaders, and what types of leaders are effective? In addition, given the importance of leadership in organisational change, we discuss the strategies that leaders can adopt to enact effective changes.Module 5: Work DesignIn this week, we will look at work design - an important issue for organisations. How should organisations design jobs for employees in order to boost their performance and well-being? We explore the concept of work design and its historical development, and we draw from academic literature to explore the characteristics that make jobs motivating and meaningful. We also discuss the issue of employee over-qualification, which is partly resulted from poor work design, and look at how it can be managed effectively.    Module 6: Safety and HealthIn this last module, we discuss the importance of safety and health in the workplace, and the impact that workplace accidents can have on individuals and organisations. We also look at the benefits for organisations by creating a safe and healthy workplace.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z", "title": "Psychology at Work", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lena Wang, Maryl\u00e8ne Gagn\u00e9, Mark Griffin, Aleksandra Luksyte, Sharon Parker, Zhijun Chen, Patrick Dunlop and Kerrie Unsworth", "institution_name": ["University of Western Australia"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Personal Development"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/work-psychology", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
