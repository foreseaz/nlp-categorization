Examples range from voting in a national election to deliberating with others\nin small committees. Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when\nwe carefully examine our group decision-making processes.\u00a0There are two types of group\ndecision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose\nthat a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which\nrestaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where\nto go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best? Can we always find a\nchoice that is \u201cfair\u201d taking into account everyone\u2019s opinions or must we choose one person\nfrom the group to act as a \u201cdictator\u201d? A fair division problem: Suppose that there is a cake and\na group of hungry children. Naturally, you want to cut the cake and distribute the pieces\nto the children as fairly as possible. If the cake is homogeneous (e.g., a chocolate cake with\nvanilla icing evenly distributed), then it is easy to find a fair division: give each child a piece\nthat is the same size. But, how do we find a \u201cfair\u201d division of the cake if it is heterogeneous\n(e.g., icing that is 1/3 chocolate, 1/3 vanilla and 1/3 strawberry) and the children each want\ndifferent parts of the cake?\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: \u00a0Voting Methods\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Voting Problem\n\u00a0 \u00a0 A Quick Introduction to Voting Methods (e.g., Plurality Rule, Borda Count, \u00a0\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Plurality with Runoff, The Hare System, Approval Voting) \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Preferences \n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Condorcet Paradox\n\u00a0 \u00a0 How Likely is the Condorcet Paradox?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Condorcet Consistent Voting Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Approval Voting\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Combining Approval and Preference\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Voting by Grading\n\n \n\n\n\nWeek 2: Voting Paradoxes\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Choosing How to Choose\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Condorcet's Other Paradox\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Should the Condorcet Winner be Elected?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Failures of Monotonicity\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Multiple-Districts Paradox\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Spoiler Candidates and Failures of Independence\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Failures of Unanimity\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Optimal Decisions or Finding Compromise?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Finding a Social Ranking vs. Finding a Winner\n\n\n\nWeek 3: Characterizing Voting Methods\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Classifying Voting Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Social Choice Model\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Anonymity, Neutrality and Unanimity\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Characterizing Majority Rule\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Characterizing  Voting Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Five Characterization Results\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Distance-Based Characterizations of Voting Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Arrow's Theorem\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Proof of Arrow's Theorem\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Variants of Arrow's Theorem\n\n\n \n\n    Week 4: Topics in Social Choice Theory\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Introductory Remarks\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Domain Restrictions: Single-Peakedness\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Sen\u2019s Value Restriction\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Strategic Voting\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Manipulating Voting Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Lifting Preferences\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Sen's Liberal Paradox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Week 5: Aggregating Judgements\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Voting in Combinatorial Domains\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Anscombe's Paradox\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Multiple Elections Paradox\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Condorcet Jury Theorem\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Paradoxes of Judgement Aggregation\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Judgement Aggregation Model\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Properties of Aggregation Methods\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Impossibility Results in Judgement Aggregation\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Proof of the Impossibility Theorem(s)\n\n\n\n\n    Week 6: Fair Division\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Introduction to Fair Division\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Fairness Criteria  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Efficient and Envy-Free Divisions\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Finding an Efficient and Envy Free Division\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Help the Worst Off or Avoid Envy?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The Adjusted Winner Procedure\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Manipulating the  Adjusted Winner Outcome\nWeek 7: \u00a0Cake-Cutting Algorithms \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Cake Cutting Problem\n\u00a0 \u00a0Cut and Choose \n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Equitable and Envy-Free Proocedures\n\u00a0 \u00a0Proportional Procedures\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Stromquist Procedure\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Selfridge-Conway Procedure\n\u00a0 \u00a0Concluding Remarks\n\n\n\n    \n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-10-20T00:00:00Z", "title": "Making Better Group Decisions: Voting, Judgement Aggregation and Fair Division", "price": 0, "instructors": "Eric Pacuit", "institution_name": ["University of Maryland, College Park"], "commitment": "1-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/votingfairdiv", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
