You will examine the inequalities of birth, particularly being born rich or poor and being born female or male.\n\nYou will also look at the lottery of birth as it relates to becoming a parent. You\u2019ll consider how individual countries and global organisations are responding to demographic changes and predictions and how this plays out in the lives of individual women and men in different parts of the world.\n\nYou\u2019ll use a variety of disciplines in the course such as demography, health studies, sociology, comparative social policy, history, political science and economics. This interdisciplinary nature brings different perspectives together to create fresh insights and provide a bridge for different ideas to feed into social and political change.\n\nTowards the end of the course, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to critically analyse an initiative of your choosing from your own country and review the analysis of a fellow learner.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Lottery of Birth", "price": 0, "instructors": "Pam Foley", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/lottery-of-birth?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
