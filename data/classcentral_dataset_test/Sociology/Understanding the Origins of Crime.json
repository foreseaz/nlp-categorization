But most do not use that information when studying what crime is and why it exists. In this course, you will learn the process of natural selection and how it can be used to make sense of criminal behaviour.\r\nWe will use the theory of evolution to make sense of a broad range of crimes including several types of homicide, child abuse and neglect, spousal assault and group level aggression such as warfare, hooliganism, rioting, and gang fights.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nWhat natural selection is and how to predict what it will do\r\nThe definition of \u201cbiological functionality\u201d and some of the common misconceptions about it\r\nSome of the basic lessons we can learn about our species and crime from an understanding of Darwinian theory\r\nWhy kin murder is so rare, but the reasons it does occur\r\nSome of the reasons infanticide and child neglect occur\r\nThe origins of jealousy and its relationship to spousal homicides\r\nThe characteristics of a \u201ctypical\u201d homicide\r\nWhy status is so important and how it relates to aggression\r\nWar and warriorship, and examples from across the animal kingdom\r\nHow natural selection rewards warfare\r\nHow pathogens relate to war in the modern world\r\n\r\nThis course requires approximately 2 - 4 hours of study per week, but can vary depending on the student.
