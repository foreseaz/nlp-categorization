Do they overlap? Over six weeks we\u2019ll get a sense of how some individuals answer these questions, and you\u2019ll get the tools you need to explore these questions for yourselves.\n\nWe will start our time together with some basic assumptions, the most important being a willingness to think about Hip Hop and religion as cultures that wrestle with the huge questions of our existence: Who are we? Why are we? Where are we?\u00a0 on hip You will also need to be open to the possibility of Hip Hop as a language through which these complex and religious questions are presented, explored, and interpreted.\n\nAs this course unfolds, we\u2019ll look closely into the relationship between Hip Hop culture and religion. We will explore the ways in which Hip Hop culture discusses and provides life meaning in complex ways through\u00a0 (1) a discussion of the history and content of rap music; (2) an examination of religion in rap music; (3) an exploration of the religious sensibilities of rap artists; and (4) a discussion of the implications of the connection between rap and religion.\n\nWe will accomplish this through a unique mix of videos, readings, music, images, stories and behind-the scenes insider perspectives.\u00a0\n\nAll required readings are available within the courseware and complete texts are also available for purchase.\n\nJoin this course to enhance your understanding of the intersections between religion and Hip Hop culture in the United States. No prior knowledge is required. All lectures will be in English.\n\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.
