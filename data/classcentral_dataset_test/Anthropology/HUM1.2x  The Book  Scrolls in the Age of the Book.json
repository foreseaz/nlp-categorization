The codex, with its portability and instant access to any place in the text, became the dominant container for writing after the 4th century BCE, but scrolls continued to be made. Why and how did the scroll format remain popular and relevant in the age of the codex? This course proposes four main reasons, which\u00a0\n\naccount for essentially every kind of scroll that still exists today. We will see and examine in detail a number of beautiful objects, and come to understand the thinking of those who chose the scroll format for their texts.\n\nThis module features four main units, each of which is based on one of the reasons for scroll-making:\n\nScrolls of indeterminate length\n\tScrolls in long format\n\tCeremonial and archaizing scrolls\n\tPortable scrolls\nScrolls in the Age of the Book also features a guided tour of an exhibition on Harvard University\u2019s collection of medieval scrolls, held at Houghton Library, Harvard\u2019s special collections library, in Spring 2014. Each scroll featured in the exhibit has been fully digitized by Harvard\u2019s Preservation Services division, and participants will have the opportunity to interact with them in unprecedented fashion using Mirador, a state-of-the-art web application developed by Harvard and Stanford Universities.\n\nThis is a module in the series The Book: Histories Across Time and Space.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code.
