If archaeologists\nare trained to investigate the past, what is left for us to study?\u00a0 Who gets to be an archaeologist?\u00a0 How and why do archaeologists hunt for\n\u201ctreasures\u201d, and what do we do once we\u2019ve discovered them?\u00a0 What can we know, and not know, about people\nin the past? \u00a0What do archaeologists know\nabout the past that most people would never guess \u2013 and why aren\u2019t we telling\nyou?\u00a0 Why are people entirely willing to\nmurder each other over the fate of archaeological sites? \u00a0Are Real Men alone capable of discovering the\ntruth behind all this?\n\nArchaeology famously involves getting dirty in\nthe line of duty.\u00a0 Students will\nexperience its hands-on nature, through the use of numerous exercises and archaeological\ncase studies.\u00a0 But there are other \u2018dirty\nlittle secrets\u2019 to learn about the field: not least how the stories\narchaeologists tell about the past have been used and abused, for purposes both\ngood and bad.\u00a0 Our goal by the end of the\ncourse is to have you \u2018thinking like an archaeologist\u2019 and fully aware of the often-fraught\npolitics of doing archaeology around the globe.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit #1:\u00a0 Just what are\nthese secrets anyway?\n\nUnit #2:\u00a0 What\nhas survived for us to find?\u00a0 And what\nhave we lost?\n\nUnit #3:\u00a0 So how do\nyou find things?\u00a0 Archaeology \u2260\njust digging\n\nUnit #4:\u00a0 How do you\nget a date?
