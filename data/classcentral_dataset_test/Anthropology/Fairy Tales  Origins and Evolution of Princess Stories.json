We\u2019ll borrow tools from cultural studies, literature studies, and film studies to help us analyze these phenomena and what they mean to our society.\r\n\r\nMany of us may associate princess stories with modern-day products (much of it marketed to small children) or with Disney movies and theme parks. We\u2019ll examine these current versions of fairy tale mythos as well, using our new interpretive tools to uncover not just what\u2019s been changed in the moral and message of the narrative, but what the stories mean as told now.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-09-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "Fairy Tales: Origins and Evolution of Princess Stories", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kevin Yee and Shelly Stewart", "institution_name": ["University of South Florida"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/fairy-tales-origins-and-evolution-of-princess-stories", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
