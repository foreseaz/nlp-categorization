This course will introduce you to the basic language you will need to eat, live, and get around in Mandarin speaking countries.\n\nSince this is a language course, we recommend taking this course with a friend or group of friends. Practicing with others by speaking the language will help you learn it more effectively. Additionally, Mandarin is a tonal language, which means that in order to truly master it, you will need to say the words out loud!
