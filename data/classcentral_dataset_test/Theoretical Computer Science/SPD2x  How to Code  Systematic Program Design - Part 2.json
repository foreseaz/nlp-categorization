You will design animations and games in which a number of objects move around the screen. You will also design programs that operate on family trees and other hierarchical structures.\n\nBut even as your programs get more complex, you will find that the design method makes them easy to write; and that the resulting code is well-structured, well-tested and easy to maintain.\n\nThis course is part of the How to Code - Systematic Program Design XSeries Program:\u00a0\n\nHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1\n\tHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 3\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-03-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "SPD2x: How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gregor Kiczales", "institution_name": ["The University of British Columbia"], "commitment": "8-12 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-systematic-program-design-part-ubcx-spd2x", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
