We'll create pieces that are expressive, meditative, or 'design-y' to instigate, evoke, experiment, record, explain, or to try out a media. The first two weeks are experimental and exploratory; we won\u2019t be concerned with meaning or communication (although, to be honest, every image does exist in a context, and therefore communicates\u2014or can convey\u2014meaning, connotation, associations, and expressiveness). \n\nIn the second two weeks, we\u2019ll invite the images to deliberately and intentionally carry meaning and communication through relational moves like juxtaposition, composition, and context. Everyone has a natural, intuitive way of putting things together. We\u2019ll look at developing and expanding the range of approaches for putting things together, composing page spreads with your images. Since nothing exists without context, we look at how to intentionally drive the image\u2019s connotations, meanings and associations generated through elements of composition and \u201cvisual contrasts.\u201d through style, juxtaposition, closure and figures of speech. \n\nUltimately, we will take the images that you create and make a book from them.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Image-based ResearchWelcome! This we will introduce image-based research and investigate these images in a design context using a range of techniques. You will then choose a subject of your own to research that will become the basis for your experiments and designs in the coming weeks.  Week 2: Making ImagesThis week is a making session!  You will take the subject you selected last week and think about it in different ways.  From simple to complex, hand to digital, realistic to abstract and everything in between, we'll explore and experiment freely. We'll also consider different modes of representation, and try a hand at creating our own ranges of representation with images. Week 3: Composition is RelationalIn this third week, we will define and investigate core principles of composition, and begin to compose simple spreads for your book. Week 4: Designing a Book with Your ImagesIn this final week, we will pull together your work from the previous weeks to make spreads using 10-20 of your favorite images from your assignments and compile them into a self-bound booklet.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Imagemaking", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gail Swanlund", "institution_name": ["California Institute of the Arts"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-making", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
