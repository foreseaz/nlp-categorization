In each class, we'll start by observing the factors that influence and shape aesthetic outcomes. You'll begin to see how design elements come in to being. Quizzes at the end of each module test your knowledge of concepts, developments and principal players, and a short reflective assignment will give you the opportunity to analyze the key questions designers ask themselves today.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "History of Graphic Design", "price": 0, "instructors": "Louise Sandhaus and Lorraine Wild", "institution_name": ["California Institute of the Arts"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/graphic-design-history", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
