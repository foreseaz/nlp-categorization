This course provides an introduction to the tools and principles of biomimicry, a new discipline that emulates nature's best ideas and blueprints in order to solve human design challenges. Each week you\u2019ll get outside to explore nature and learn a key biomimicry design concept that you\u2019ll then apply to develop a novel biomimetic design.\r\nAt the completion of the course, students will have:\r\n\r\nDefined and applied biomimicry concepts, tools, and principles by creating novel biomimetic designs.\r\nDifferentiated between nature\u2019s design principles, strategies, functions, and patterns to apply them to human-made designs.\r\nObserved nature and conducted research to learn from nature through real-world, outdoor observations.\r\nEmployed the biological solutions database AskNature.org to serve as a research tool for design challenges.\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Biomimicry: A Sustainable Design Methodology", "price": 0, "instructors": "Cindy Gilbert", "institution_name": ["Minneapolis College of Art and Design"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/mcad/courses/biomimicry-sustainable-design-1", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
