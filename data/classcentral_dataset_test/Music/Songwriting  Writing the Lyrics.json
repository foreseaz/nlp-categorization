All you\u2019ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.\n\nAssignments will ask you to post something for peer review\u2014sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\n\nMost important, you\u2019ll have a lot of fun.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Welcome to Songwriting: Writing the LyricsWelcome to the course!
