This will be approached through a study of form and variation techniques used in music. Students will be asked to make more from less while maintaining musical interest in their compositions.\n\nCompositional techniques and styles studied include minimalism, ambient, alternative, musique concr\u00e9te, popular, independent, experimental and sample based music. Assessment will consist of short composition assignments (1-2 min) rooted in class discussion and readings. These will be turned in as audio files. A single composition of 5-10 minutes will act as the final project.\n\nBy the end of this course students will be able to:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Compose an engaging piece of music using a minimum amount of musical material.\n\n\u00b7 Critically engage with a piece of music through aural analysis.\n\n\u00b7 Analyze or break down music compositions to determine structural form and construction.\n\n\u00b7 Adapt compositional principles to their own music.\n\n\u00b7 Discover new approaches to music composition.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1:\u00a0Critical Listening And Analysis Strategies Without Traditional Music Theory\u00a0\r\nSession 2:\u00a0Creating Music In A DAW And Composing A Simple Shape With Sound\u00a0\r\nSession 3:\u00a0How Loops Can Be Used To Create Harmonic Or Structural Changes And Discovering Different Pathways To Accomplish The Goal\u00a0\r\nSession 4:\u00a0Defining, Creating, And Losing A Sense Of Time In Loop Based Music\u00a0\r\nSession 5:\u00a0Examining Ambient Tracks And Analyzing The Compositional Elements At Work\u00a0\r\nSession 6:\u00a0Sources And Inspiration: Strategies For Sample Based Collage Works\u00a0\r\nSession 7:\u00a0Understanding EQ And Its Role In Composition And Mixing\u00a0\r\nSession 8:\u00a0Examining The Extramusical Content Of Your Work\u00a0\r\nSession 9:\u00a0Form As Musical Expression\u00a0\r\nSession 10:\u00a0Synthesis Of Ideas: The Many From The One And Back Again\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Loop: Repetition and Variation in Music", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jeffrey Weeter", "institution_name": ["University College Cork"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.kadenze.com/courses/loop-repetition-and-variation-in-music/info", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Kadenze"], "start_date": "2016-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
