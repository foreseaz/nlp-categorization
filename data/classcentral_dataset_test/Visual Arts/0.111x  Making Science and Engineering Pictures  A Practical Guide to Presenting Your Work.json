Learners will upload their images to small, online working groups for discussion and review. \u00a0You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background contribute to creating more compelling images that help communicate science visually. The course also includes interviews with noteable image makers and art directors.\n\u00a0\nWhile previous experience with a camera will be helpful, it is not essential. In order to complete the course assignments, you will need access to a single-lens reflex camera (a camera that can accept interchangeable lenses), a 105 macro lens, a flatbed scanner, and a smartphone or tablet with camera. Learners without access to this equipment can still benefit from the course concepts. However, full participation in the image making assignments will create more meaningful hands-on experience.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-07-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "0.111x: Making Science and Engineering Pictures: A Practical Guide to Presenting Your Work", "price": 0, "instructors": "Felice Frankel", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/making-science-engineering-pictures-mitx-0-111x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
