Pick one from below:\n                                                                    livearthistory-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This course approaches the questions of \u201cart\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d from the perspective of contemporary makers of art (sculpture, painting, photography, performance, installation and more), animators (whether character/story-based or experimental) and gamers, asking how artists actively make a history for their own practices by thinking about the creative process as a \u201cconversation\u201d with a wide range of art from the past. Why are ground-breaking artists so often historically-minded (and yet tend to break all the rules of conventional history-telling)? How do animators themselves \u201cwrite\u201d the largely unwritten history of their art through quotation, transposition and mash-ups? Why should contemporary gamers look at classical painting anyway?\u00a0\n\nThis course will combine short video lectures/interviews and interactive quizzes with independent, peer-reviewed\u00a0sketchbook and field work (suggested visits to local museums, film viewings, etc.) It is intended to give the student a background in a wide range of visual practices and a greater familiarity with techniques of historical analysis. It will help to build skills in visual analysis, and will also provide insight into the creative culture of CalArts, where a certain portion of these art histories have been made in the first place.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: IntroductionWeek 2: StoryWeek 3: CharacterWeek 4: World-MakingWeek 5: Time &amp; MotionWeek 6: Reality DistortionWeek 7: NoveltyWeek 8: Mash-UpsWeek 9: Conclusions\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Live!:  A History of Art for Artists, Animators and Gamers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jeannene Przyblyski", "institution_name": ["California Institute of the Arts"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/livearthistory", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
