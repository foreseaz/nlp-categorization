Between one-quarter and one-third of all research students never finish their degree. The PhD is an emotional journey as much as it is an intellectual one.\n\nWhat kinds of emotions does the research degree process provoke? What strategies can help students deal with the emotional highs and lows? How can academic advisors, family and friends help research students cope with these stresses - and celebrate the successes?\n\nThis course is primarily designed for masters, PhD, and research students and the academics who are tasked with helping them, but you may also be a family member or friend of a PhD student who is seeking to better understand what your loved one is going through.\n\nBy directly addressing the emotional issues, and by helping us see the connections between emotional resilience and success, this course aims to help us all create a more supportive academic environment, where students can do their best research work.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-11-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "RSIT-01x: How to Survive Your PhD", "price": 0, "instructors": "Inger Mewburn", "institution_name": ["Australian National University"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/how-survive-phd-anux-rsit-01x", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
