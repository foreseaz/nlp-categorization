It will challenge you take control of your own learning, to determine your own personal learning objectives, to contribute to the development of the curriculum, to reflect on your progress, to learn new digital skills, and to take a leadership role in the virtual classroom. It will also provide you with the opportunity to connect with colleagues from different countries and professions, and to better understand areas where your interests overlap and where unexpected distinctions exist. We hope you\u2019ll consider taking this journey with us.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\u00a0Introduction to Open KnowledgeWeek 2:\u00a0Technological Change, Digital Identity, and Connected LearningWeek 3:\u00a0Participatory Culture, Citizen Journalism, Citizen ScienceWeek 4:\u00a0Intellectual Property, Copyright, and the Economics of OpenWeek 5:\u00a0Historical Perspectives: Learned Publishing from Medieval to Modern TimesWeek 6:\u00a0Open Science, Data, Access, Source, ReviewWeek 7:\u00a0Open Educational Resources: From Lesson Plans to Instructional VideosWeek 8:\u00a0Archives, Databases, Encyclopedia: Evaluating Open Collections and Reference SourcesWeek 9:\u00a0Scholarly Publishing and Communications: Journals, Books, and Publication of ResearchWeek 10:\u00a0Information Literacy: Overload, Filters, and Developing a Critical LensWeek 11:\u00a0Global Perspectives on Equity, Development, and Open KnowledgeWeek 12:\u00a0Student Publishing: Lessons in Publishing, Peer Review, and Knowledge SharingWeek 13:\u00a0The Future of Open Knowledge\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-12-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "OpenKnowledge: Changing the global course of learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Samuel Smith Esseh, Arianna Becerril Garc\u00eda and John Willinsky", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "1-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Education/OpenKnowledge/Fall2014/about", "duration": "14 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Stanford OpenEdx"], "start_date": "2014-09-02T00:00:00Z"}
