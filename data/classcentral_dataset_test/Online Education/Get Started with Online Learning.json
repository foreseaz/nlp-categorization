But how many of us have considered studying online?\n\nIn this free online course, you will find out what online learning is and what it can offer you. You\u2019ll discover the skills required for online study and evaluate your own study skillset. You\u2019ll also examine how students form online communities and how they benefit from flexible study arrangements while still being supported by dedicated tutors.\n\nStudying online takes advantage of technology to simulate or improve upon traditional methods of teaching. This course draws on the expertise of The Open University to introduce you to some of these teaching methods, including looking at two periods of European history, teaching chemistry through the online OpenScience Laboratory and using free apps to practise writing Chinese characters.\n\nStudying at a campus university isn\u2019t for everyone. If you have caring responsibilities, want to re-skill to change careers or develop professionally, or simply wish to earn while you learn, then online study may be for you.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "Get Started with Online Learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Laura Hills", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/online-learning?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
