{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Information Technology"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This course provides an overview of Enterprise Computing and in particular, the role of System z hardware and its primary operating system (z/OS) in an Enterprise Computing environment. The emphasis is on commercial computing.  The introductory topic provides an overview of Enterprise Computing in general. This is followed with an introduction to the System z enterprise server hardware and its operating system, z/OS. Enterprise computing involves many different types of workloads; for example, transaction processing, business intelligence, end user interactive computing, web serving, data serving, batch, and many others. This short course will provide an overview of two very important Enterprise Computing workloads: end user interactive computing (TSO/ISPF and USS) and batch processing and their related technologies.\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n\r\nSome familiarity with an existing operating system (e.g. UNIX, Windows, etc. ) and associated terminology and concepts.\r\nA high speed internet connection for access to course materials.\r\nA current version of Internet Explorer or another browser to view the web pages associated with the course materials. Adobe acrobat reader (current version).\r\nWord processing software or the ability to read current word processing documents.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nCourse Learning Objectives:\r\nUpon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to do the following:\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nList the characteristics of Enterprise Computing\r\nDescribe the role of Enterprise Server in an Enterprise Computing environment and list some of its characteristics.\r\nList the distinguishing characteristics of the System z architecture and hardware.\r\nList some of the characteristics of the z/OS operating system and why these characteristics are of value to an Enterprise Computing configuration.\r\nDescribe some commonly used z/OS data sets, their characteristics and use.\r\nBe familiar with basic functions and usage of TSO, ISPF, and JCL\r\nDescribe the characteristics of batch workloads and their importance to Enterprise Computing.\r\nDiscuss, at a high level, the functions and processing of batch jobs by JES2\r\nExplain the flow of a job\r\nBe familiar with and able to use System z and z/OS terminology and acronyms.\r\nBe familiar with the System z hardware and software history and evolution.\r\n\r\nRequired Reading\r\nThe IBM text, \u201cIntroduction to the New Mainframe: z/OS Basics\u201d will be the base text for the course. The IBM publication number is: SG24-6366. A softcopy of this book is available for download at http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246366.html as well as a means to order a hardcopy. In addition, topic lecture material and notes will be provided to complement/augment the reading. Additional supplementary reading will be noted and may be used in some of the assignments or discussions. Other relevant PDF extracts, papers, articles, etc. will also be provided as well as URLs to relevant web resources.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCourse Grading\r\nA passing grade for all the course quizzes is 70%. Students can re-take a quiz if they want to improve their grade. You do not have to pass a quiz in order to move on to the next topic. If a student passes all quizzes with a passing grade, the student has successfully completed the class.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1Course WelcomeIntroduction to Enterprise Computing\r\nWeek 2Introduction to Enterprise Servers\r\nWeek 3Introduction to z/OS\r\nWeek 4Introduction to Data Sets and Related Concepts\r\nWeek 5Introduction to TSO, ISPF, and USS\r\nWeek 6 Introduction to Batch\r\nWeek 7Introduction to JCL\r\nWeek 8Introduction to the Job Entry SubsystemCourse Closing\r\n\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-07-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Enterprise Computing", "price": 0, "instructors": "Angelo Corridori", "institution_name": ["Marist College"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://mooc.marist.edu/web/ecc/introduction-to-enterprise-computing", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2014-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
