Creating and detecting light using lasers, LEDs, cameras and detectors will also be covered.  \n\nStudents will learn the key skill of combining these components into an optical systems capable of providing key information to a robot or device that requires sensory information.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Optics for Robots and Drones", "price": 0, "instructors": "Donn Silberman", "institution_name": ["University of California, Irvine"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/optics-robots-drones", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
