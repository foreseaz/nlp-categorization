This course deals with analysis techniques that can be applied to all such circuits. We'll first discuss electrical quantities-voltage and current-relevant to such circuits and learn about basic elements(R, L, C, controlled sources) and their properties. We'll then move on to general analysis techniques that can be applied to arbitrary circuits. These will be first carried out for resistive circuits which obey algebraic equations and then extended to circuits with energy storage elements(C, L) which obey differential equations. Along the way, we'll also discuss the rudiments of negative feedback circuit using the opamp. After taking this course, one should be able to analyze any linear circuit.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\nCircuit elements(R, L, C, M, and controlled sources)\r\nVoltage, current, power, and energy\r\nBasic circuit laws\r\nNodal analysis\r\nMesh analysis\r\nCircuit theorems\r\nTwo port networks\r\nOpamp and negative feedback\r\nFirst order (RC, RL) circuits\r\nSecond order RLC circuits\r\nSinusoidal steady state response\r\nPhasor analysis\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Basic Electrical Circuits", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. Nagendra Krishnapura", "institution_name": ["IIT ( Indian Institute of Technology Madras)"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_ee01/preview", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2015-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
