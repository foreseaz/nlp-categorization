Any electrical engineering product handles signals using electrical networks and circuits, which are called systems. Having a good understanding of signals and their time/frequency domain characterization is an absolute must for any electrical engineer. This course is a basic introduction to discrete and continuous-time signals, Fourier series, Fourier transforms and Laplace transforms.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Networks and Systems", "price": 0, "instructors": "C.
