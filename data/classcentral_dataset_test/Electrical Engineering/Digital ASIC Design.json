They rely on silicon chip technology to enable society to build complex systems including wireless devices, tablets, computers, network routers, etc. Due to the rapid rate of improvement of the underlying silicon technology, these chips are constantly being redesigned. Thus digital ASIC design companies are strong employers all around the world.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-07-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "Digital ASIC Design", "price": 0, "instructors": "Paul D.
