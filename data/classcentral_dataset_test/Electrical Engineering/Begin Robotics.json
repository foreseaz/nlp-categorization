And, if you share Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking\u2019s world view, the super intelligent ones may one day bring about the end of the human  race.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard about them, but how many of us know what makes a robot a robot? And can anyone get a robot to do a particular task?\n\nAn introduction to robotics\n\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more, but are worried that you don\u2019t have Hawking\u2019s brain or an advanced qualification in cybernetics, this four week, free online course is for you.\n\nWe\u2019re not planning to sit you down with a soldering iron, but we will introduce you to the basics of robot design through a series of simulations that will have you test driving an Eric \u2013 our very own University of Reading mobile robot.\n\nHow far back does Robot history go?\n\nWe\u2019ll start by looking at some of the earliest, real and fictional robots ever invented: from musical automata in 13th century Iraq to Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s mechanical lion; from the early 20th century science fiction of \u201cMetropolis\u201d and Asimov to the first Mars lander in 1996.\n\nLook inside a mobile robot\n\nAfter dipping into robot history, you\u2019ll be ready to get more hands on. Our experts will guide you through the basics. Using a combination of videos, animations, screencasts, articles, discussions and quizzes, you\u2019ll explore the internals of mobile robots.\n\nYou\u2019ll find out about the individual components of robot anatomy (the mechanics, electronics and computer \u201cbrain\u201d) and how they relate to one another and to the sensors - the parts that enable the machine to perceive its surroundings.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll tackle the motors: how do you control your robot to help it avoid obstacles, head in the right direction and travel at an optimum speed?\n\nA \u201cthinking\u201d machine?\n\nIn the final week, you\u2019ll investigate the thought-provoking topic of robot behaviour.\n\n\n  \n    What can we learn about developing robots based on what we know about living systems?\n  \n  \n    If we introduce a simple \u201cbrain\u201d, what influence does this have on the robot\u2019s behaviour?\n  \n  \n    How is a robot\u2019s movement specified by what it perceives?\n  \n  \n    Can we create robots with basic instincts, and the ability to learn and co-operate with one another?\n  \n\n\nCome and join us for this action-packed course.  We look forward to hearing why you\u2019re interested in finding out more about robots and hope you\u2019ll enjoy meeting many of ours.\n\nThrough our weekly video feature, \u201cMeet the Robots at Reading,\u201d you\u2019ll find out more about our collection: from machines built by our students from scratch; to Baxter (the first of a new generation of smarter, more adaptive interactive industrial robots); to one or two special guests, who you may recognise from elsewhere.\n\nScampi (pictured above) is a 28 gram walking robot created by Robotics student Rory Mangles and is mostly made of paperclips.\n\n\n\nThis course is taken from our Make it Digital collection - part of the BBC\u2019s major initiative to inspire digital creativity.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Begin Robotics", "price": 0, "instructors": "William Harwin, Tharindu Liyanagunawardena and Richard Mitchell", "institution_name": ["University of Reading"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/begin-robotics?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
