Wondering how to implement filters using resistors, inductors, and capacitors? Wondering what are some other applications of RLC and CMOS circuits? This free circuit course, taught by edX CEO and MIT Professor Anant Agarwal and MIT colleagues, is for you.\n\nThe third and final online Circuits and Electronics courses is taken by all MITElectrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) majors.\n\nTopics covered include: dynamics of capacitor, inductor and resistor networks; design in the time and frequency domains; op-amps, and analog and digital circuits and applications. Design and lab exercises are also significant components of the course.\n\nWeekly coursework includes interactive video sequences, readings from the textbook, homework, online laboratories, and optional tutorials. The course will also have a final exam.\n\nThis is a self-paced course, so there are no weekly deadlines. However, all assignments are due by May 16, 2017, when the course will close.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStudent Testimonials\n\n\u201cBrilliant course! It's definitely the best introduction to electronics in Universe! Interesting material, clean explanations, well prepared quizzes, challenging homeworks and fun labs.\u201d - Ilya. \n\n\u201c6.002x will be a classic in the field of online learning. It combines Prof. Agarwal's enthusiasm for electronics and education. The online circuit design program works very well. The material is difficult. I took the knowledge from the class and built an electronic cat feeder.\u201d - Stan\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-05-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "6.002.3x: Circuits and Electronics 3: Applications", "price": 0, "instructors": "Chris Terman, Piotr Mitros, Gerald Sussman and Anant Agarwal", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-electronics-3-applications-mitx-6-002-3x-0", "duration": "46 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
