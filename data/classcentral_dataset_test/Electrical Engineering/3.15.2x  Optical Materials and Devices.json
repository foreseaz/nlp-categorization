We will show how devices are built to take advantage of these properties. This is illustrated with a wide range of devices, placing a strong emphasis on new and emerging technologies.\n\nPart 1 - 3.15.1x: Electronic Materials and Devices\nPart 3 - 3.15.3x: Magnetic Materials and Devices\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "3.15.2x: Optical Materials and Devices", "price": 0, "instructors": "Caroline Ross", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "8-12 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/optical-materials-devices-mitx-3-15-2x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
