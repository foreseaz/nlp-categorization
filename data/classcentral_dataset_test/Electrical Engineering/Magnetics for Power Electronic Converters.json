The course starts with an introduction to physical principles behind inductors and transformers, including the concepts of inductance, core material saturation, airgap and energy storage in inductors, reluctance and magnetic circuit modeling, transformer equivalent circuits, magnetizing and leakage inductance. Multi-winding transformer models are also developed, including inductance matrix representation, for series and parallel structures. Modeling of losses in magnetic components covers core and winding losses, including skin and proximity effects. Finally, a complete procedure is developed for design optimization of inductors in switched-mode power converters.  \n\nAfter completing this course, you will: \n\u25cf  Understand the fundamentals of magnetic components, including inductors and transformers \n\u25cf  Be able to analyze and model losses in magnetic components, and understand design trade-offs  \n\u25cf  Know how to design and optimize inductors for switched-mode power converters \n \nThis course assumes ONLY prior completion of Introduction to Power Electronics and Converter Circuits.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to Magnetics and InductorsThis module introduces the physical principles behind magnetic devices, including magnetic material properties. It develops the concepts of inductance, reluctance and magnetic circuit modeling, and uses these to analyze different inductor structures.TransformersThis module discusses two-winding and multi-winding transformers, and develops inductance matrix and equivalent circuit models for them. It also discusses the physical origin of various non-idealities, including magnetizing and leakage inductances.Losses in Magnetic ComponentsThis module covers the various loss mechanisms in inductors and transformers, both in the core and in the winding. Topics covered include hysteresis and eddy current losses, and skin and proximity effects. Models are developed to estimate losses in magnetic components.Design of Magnetic ComponentsThis module describes techniques to design effective magnetic devices.
