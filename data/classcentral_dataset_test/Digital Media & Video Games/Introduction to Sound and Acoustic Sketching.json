In addition, a basic taxonomy of sound terms will be introduced, allowing students to develop a language for communicating and establishing dialogues about sound with all stakeholders in an audiovisual project. The practical component of the course is anchored in exercises that allow students to experiment and assimilate the different aspects of sound and acoustic\u00a0sketching, namely:\n\n\u2022 Sound Walks \u2013 Students practice \u201cdeep listening\u201d, \u201csound scripting\u201d and sound recording;\n\n\u2022 Sound Browsing and Retrieving \u2013 Students learn how to obtain free sounds (using the Free Online Sound Repository Freesound.com) and build up a scripted inventory in the process of sound design;\n\n\u2022 Sound Editing \u2013 Students learn how to produce a creative sound montage based on their acoustic memory and a sound design script, using the free multi-platform sound editing software Audacity;\n\n\u2022 Critical Sound Review \u2013 By comparing the sound sketch produced in this exercise with the actual recording of the sound walk, students can develop critical insights about the their conceptual perception and representation of an acoustic phenomena, in comparison with the factual recording of the same event;\n\n\u2022 Acoustic Mapping by Impulse Response \u2013 Students learn how to record an acoustic impulse response from a physical space;\n\n\u2022 Acoustic Imprinting by Convolution \u2013 Students learn how to imprint a pre-recorded acoustic response in an original audio content, producing an acoustic simulation for an architectural space, using free multi-platform sound programing environment Pure Data/Chuck.\n\nUpon the completion of these exercises, students will produce\u00a0two sound sketches: designing a soundscape based on their recollection of sound events, and simulating an acoustic space, based on analogous impulse responses from similar spaces.\n\nFurthermore, students will gain introductory experience using the using the free online sound repository Freesound.com, the free multi-platform sound editing software Audacity and the free multi-platform sound programing environment Pure Data (or Chuck).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1:\u00a0Sound And Acoustics\u00a0In this session, students will learn to distinguish between different elements in sound taxonomy, and sound facets and characteristics. We will also get familiar with the human hearing system. By the end of this session students will be able to comprehend basic acoustics and sound propagation in space.\r\nSession 2:\u00a0Soundscapes And Sound Walk\u00a0In this session, students will understand the Concept and origin of soundscapes and recognize Soundscapes according to Schafer\u2019s Categories (sound signals, keynote sounds, soundmarks, geophony, biophony and anthrophony).\r\nSession 3:\u00a0Sound Browsing And Retrieving\u00a0In this session, students will learn how to browse and download sounds from freesound.org and understand how to create a repository of sounds according to a sound script.\r\nSession 4:\u00a0Sound Editing And Soundscape Sketching\u00a0This session will cover the basics of editing with Audacity. At the end of this session, students will understand the concept of soundscape sketch.\r\nSession 5:\u00a0Critical Sound Review\u00a0In this session, students will develop a critical sense of analysis for different moments of a soundscape and understand the difference between factual recording of soundscapes and a designed soundscape.\r\nSession 6:\u00a0Acoustic Mapping By Impulse Response\u00a0In this session we will cover the concept of impulse response of architectural space.\r\nSession 7:\u00a0Acoustic Imprinting By Convolution\u00a0In this session, students will learn the concept of convolution and how to implement it with Pure-Data or Chuck.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-01-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Sound and Acoustic Sketching", "price": 0, "instructors": "\u00c1lvaro Barbosa", "institution_name": ["University St. Joseph"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-sound-and-acoustic-sketching/info", "duration": "7 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Kadenze"], "start_date": "2016-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
