Serious Games are games that do not have entertainment as the main purpose but rather an educational, awareness raising, training, advertisement or other \u201cserious\u201d purpose that benefits from the engaging context that games provide to motivate the users. Serious Games have been typically used in education, training, health, defense and other sectors.\r\nMOOC students will go through all the steps of the development of a Serious Educational Game from selecting the idea and binding it with learning goals to the development and testing of the game prototype in an environment that does not require programming skills. The programme of study will allow students to understand the process of idealizing, designing, developing, testing and delivering a game. At the same time, students will benefit from a hands-on experience, working in intercultural and interdisciplinary teams, exploiting the expertise of an international team of participating teachers and industry experts.\r\nWhat do I learn?\r\nThe course objective is to allow students understand the process of idealizing, designing, developing, testing and delivering a serious game.\r\nIn the end, students will be able to...\r\n\r\nUnderstand and comment the main concepts of game culture and digital game theory\r\nAnalyze game taxonomies and identify the specific characteristics of each game type\r\nCarry out analyses and user tests to understand users\u2019 demands and needs and convert them into serious game requisites (including learning objectives for game-based learning)\r\nUnderstand and apply serious game methodologies\r\nUnderstand the concepts related to game play, game flow, interactive narratives, storytelling and apply them in practice to develop an addictive game\r\nList the main tools (game editors) available to develop games and to identify the best one for a specific purpose\r\nUse a specific game editor to develop a serious game\r\nIdealize, design, develop, test and deliver a serious game\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Serious Game Design and Development", "price": 0, "instructors": "Carlos Vaz de Carvalho", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "5 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://iversity.org/en/courses/serious-game-design-and-development", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["iversity"], "start_date": "2015-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
