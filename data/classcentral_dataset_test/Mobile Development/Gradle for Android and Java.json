The first half of this course is for anyone interested in Gradle, build automation, and continuous delivery of software.\n\nThe latter half of the course reveals the magic that happens after you hit the \"Run\" button in Android Studio. You'll also explore advanced Android topics, learning to configure free vs paid app flavors, create and integrate Android libraries, test your app, and prepare your app for the Play Store.Why Take This Course?As your software projects get more ambitious, the process of building and deploying your apps will become more and more involved. However, modern software development requires rapid iterative releases, known as continuous delivery. Gradle is a next-generation build automation system that makes continuous delivery of complex projects a reality.\n\nGradle supports many languages and tools, and is tightly integrated with Android Studio. This course is useful for any developer seeking to understand Gradle, but focuses on Android builds. The default Android build settings are enough to put a simple debug app on your phone, but to build an app that's ready for the Google Play Store, you'll need to understand your build process and how to customize it.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Gradle Fundamentals\nLearn the syntax and semantics of Gradle build scripts, and understand the lifecycle of a Gradle build.\n\n### Lesson 2: Gradle for Java\nUnderstand the Gradle Java plugin, build and test Java projects, and manage dependencies.\n\n### Lesson 3: Gradle for Android\nDiscover the Gradle integration with Android Studio, and build an app with multiple product flavors.\n\n### Lesson 4: Advanced Android Builds\nCreate Android libraries, and use advanced features of the Android Gradle Plugin to configure signing, obfuscation, and testing.\n\n### Final Project\nBuild and test a joke telling app with a free ad-supported version and a paid version.
