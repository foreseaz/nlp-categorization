Understanding communications between the two languages\u2014called \"interoperability\"\u2014is becoming more and more important for developers, particularly as we prepare for the arrival of Swift 3.0. In the course, students will write classes and add functionality to classes by writing and calling methods. After learning some basic Objective-C syntax, students will examine and break down an app written in Objective-C and rewrite it in Swift. The course will conclude with a review of and practice with the most common challenges for interoperability between Objective-C and Swift.Why Take This Course?This course will teach you the distinguishing language features of Objective-C, including basic syntax. With this knowledge you will be able to confidently answer some of the most commonly asked interview questions related to Objective-C. You will migrate an app from Objective-C to Swift and in so doing become familiar with the experience of deciphering an unfamiliar Objective-C codebase, an experience you are likely to encounter in your first job as an iOS developer. You will also get an opportunity to practice with interoperability between Objective-C and Swift, practice negotiating the differences between the languages of iOS. \n\nWhen you look out at the iOS landscape you likely see that the number of engineers developing in Swift is growing rapidly, yet many apps and third party APIs are still written in Objective-C.  This course is designed to help prepare you for that landscape.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1 Objective-C and Swift, Compare and Contrast\nLearn the distinguishing language features of Objective-C.\n\n### Lesson 2 Writing Classes\nFamiliarize yourself with Objective-C syntax.
