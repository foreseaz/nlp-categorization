Decisions are at the heart of all organizations. In this module, you will also explore the nature and role of relevant information in common business decisions, and how such information facilitates these decisions and helps managers and employees avoid common pitfalls. You will also consider how the financial perspective adopted by accountants complements other, qualitative perspectives.Budgeting for Planning and ControlAt the heart of an organization\u2019s planning and control function is its budget. In this module, you will explore the purpose of budgeting, the role of managers and employees in budgeting, and related implications. You will also develop an organization\u2019s budget, ultimately understanding the iterative nature among the budget\u2019s key components: the operations, financing, and capital investments budgets.Standard Costing and Variance AnalysisAfter establishing goals, set targets, and the budget, upper management uses variance analysis to compare, assess, and investigate differences between actual and expected performance. In this module, you will learn how upper management uses variance analysis to motivate and monitor managers and employees, how to perform variance analysis on any aspect of the organization, and ultimately understand the power of this important tool for planning and control.Performance Measurement and EvaluationAccountants help implement, communicate, and evolve organizational strategy via the information they provide to owners, managers, and employees. Specifically, they help plan, monitor, and control decisions via the performance measurement, evaluation, and compensation system. In this module, you will explore many aspects of this important system, including decentralization, financial and non-financial performance measurement, strategic performance measurement systems, and subjective performance evaluation.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Managerial Accounting: Tools for Facilitating and Guiding Business Decisions", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gregory Davis", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "6-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/managerial-accounting-tools", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
