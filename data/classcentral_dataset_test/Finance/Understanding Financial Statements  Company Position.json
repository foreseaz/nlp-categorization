However, to understand accounting driven financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less about counting and more about measuring. \u201cWhat is it that is being measured?\u201d Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions. By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the remaining measurement question.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n\u2022\tDescribe the purpose of a balance sheet.\n\u2022\tDefine the three components of a balance sheet.\n\u2022\tRecognize and understand the meaning of several items typically presented on a balance sheet. \n\u2022\tExplain the broader purpose of financial statements and the role of accounting in producing the financial statements.\n\u2022\tRead and, to some extent, interpret real-world balance sheets.\n\nIf you enjoy this business course and are interested in an MBA, consider applying to the iMBA, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price offered by the University of Illinois.
