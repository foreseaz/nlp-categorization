With finite resources and limited staffing, developing the most appropriate business plan can be a challenge for many nonprofits that are more focused on the immediate needs than their sustainability over the long haul.\r\nThis course teaches nonprofit organizations, social entrepreneurs, and social change leaders how to use financial modeling and creative approaches to market-based funding to scale the impact of their work.
