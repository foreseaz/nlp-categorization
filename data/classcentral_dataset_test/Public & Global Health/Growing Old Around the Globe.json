We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social\n    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored\n    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences\n    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,\n    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile\n    a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each week\u2019s\n    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout\n    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course\n    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \n\nWeek Zero: How do I\ncritically appraise information about ageing?Key Concepts:ResourcesEvaluationInterpretationApplicationWeek One: \u00a0\u00a0What is ageing?\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n    Biology and senescence\n    Psychological ageing\n    Social ageing\n\n\nWeek Two: \u00a0\u00a0What is it to be old?\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n    Familial and filial structure\n    Functional status\n    Social welfare/well being\n    Ageing in place\n    Longevity\n\n\n\n\nWeek Three: \u00a0 What is an ageing society?\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n    Ageing population (birth rate decline and longevity increase)\n    Elder dependency\n    Generativity\n    Gerontocracy\n    Gero-economics\n\n\n\n\nWeek Four: \u00a0 What is it to age well?\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n    Usual and successful ageing\n    Healthy ageing\n    Well being\n    Quality of life\n    Spirituality and ageing\n\n\n\n\nWeek Five: \u00a0What are the global implications of ageing?\n\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n    Ageing workforce\n    Caregiving workforce\n    Migration\n    Public health\n    Public policy\n\nWeek Six: \u00a0\u00a0What do ageing societies need to do to prepare\nfor the future?\n\nKey Concepts:\n    \n\n\n    Human resources\n    Financial resources\n    Cultural precepts\n    Ethical principles\n\nFor the full syllabus, click here.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Growing Old Around the Globe", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sarah Kagan and Anne Shoemaker", "institution_name": ["University of Pennsylvania"], "commitment": "5-10 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/oldglobe", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
