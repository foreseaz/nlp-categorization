More specifically, with this course we expect the students to reach the following goals:\r\n(i) knowing the philosophical significance of the sorites paradox and of the Liar paradox,\r\n(ii) knowing some basic reactions to the sorites paradox and to the Liar paradox.\r\n(iii) acquiring familiarity with the logics K3, LP and ST.\r\n(iv) mastering the concepts of paracompleteness, paraconsistency and duality.\r\n(v) acquiring familiarity with the use of multiple conclusions.\r\n(vi) mastering the tableaux technique to construct proofs for classical propositional logic, K3, LP, ST.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Logic and Paradoxes", "price": 0, "instructors": "Pablo Cobreros", "institution_name": ["Universidad de Navarra"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursesites.com/webapps/Bb-sites-course-creation-BBLEARN/courseHomepage.htmlx?course_id=_284424_1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open Education by Blackboard"], "start_date": "2013-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
