Can teaching virtues such as honesty, self-control, fairness, resilience and respect - which contribute to good character - be part of the solution to many of the challenges facing society today?\n\nThis free online course offers you the opportunity to understand virtues and the role they play in helping both individuals and society flourish.  We will tap into this increasing interest and answer important questions such as what is character and character education, why is it important and can it be taught?  For those interested in extending their learning it will also provide a taster course for an exciting new MA in Character Education currently being developed by the University of Birmingham.\n\nLearn with academic experts and practising teachers\n\nWe will draw on the insights of academics from the Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues within the School of Education at the University of Birmingham.  These leading experts in the fields of character education and virtue ethics will help you explore the theoretical and philosophical basis for character education, including a background to virtue ethics.\n\nYou\u2019ll also meet teachers and head teachers with first-hand experience of the transformative power of implementing character education in day-to-day practices within a school.  They\u2019ll discuss how character might be taught in a conscious, planned and reflective way, enabling you to gain practical knowledge on taking character education into educational settings.\n\nYou can learn according to your interests and at your convenience.
