All of the resources are free and designed to be equally accessible and transformative for a wide audience.\n\nYou will gain access to a supportive learning community led by Professor Gregory Nagy and his Board of Readers, who model techniques for \u201creading out\u201d of ancient texts. This approach allows readers with little or even no experience in the subject matter to begin seeing this literature as an exquisite, perfected system of communication.\n\nHeroesX participants are also eligible to register for Hour 25, an open-ended, community-driven companion project hosted by Harvard\u2019s Center for Hellenic Studies.\n\u00a0\n\nNo previous knowledge of Greek history, literature, or language is required. This is a project for students of any age, culture, and geographic location, and its profoundly humanistic message can be easily received without previous acquaintance with Western Classical literature.\n\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code : https://www.edx.org/edx-terms-service.
