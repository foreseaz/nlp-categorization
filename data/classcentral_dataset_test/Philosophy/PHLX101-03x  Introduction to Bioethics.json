What should we think of the coming genetic revolution? How much control should we have over how and when we die? When does medical treatment turn into medical enhancement \u2014 and should we care? Is rationing health care good, bad, necessary \u2014 or all of the above?\n\nThis course will explore fundamental moral issues that arise in medicine, health, and biotechnology. Get behind the headlines \u2014 and polarized debates \u2014 and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\n\nDesigned to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.\n\nBefore your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs.\u00a0Learn more.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "PHLX101-03x: Introduction to Bioethics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tom Beauchamp, Robert Veatch, Margaret Little, Rebecca Kukla, Madison Powers, John Keown and Karen Stohr", "institution_name": ["Georgetown University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-bioethics-georgetownx-phlx101-03x", "duration": "11 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
