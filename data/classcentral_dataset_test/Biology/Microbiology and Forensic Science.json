What is the causative agent? In this course you will be touring through four modules, starting by taking a close look at the bacterial cell structure and functions which will then lead you to the study of viruses.\r\nYou will go through the differences in the different types of cells which will allow you to distinguish the two major groups of bacteria and techniques. Next, you will focus on Forensic Microbiology, its history and how this discipline has evolved. Finally, we will look at the latest molecular techniques used for detecting microbes\u2019 genetic material.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nBacterial cell structure and function\r\nViruses and their structure\r\nHow Forensic Microbiology has evolved\r\nDifferent types of Forensic Microbiology\r\nDifferences in Forensic Science versus Forensic Microbiology\r\nHow to read a scientific journal and review one in a case study\r\nGenotyping techniques\r\nThe role of DNA and RNA in Microbiology and Forensic Science\r\n\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nMolecular Laboratory Technician\r\nForensic Scientist\r\nForensic Studies\r\nTeacher of Microbiology\r\nTeacher of Forensic Scientist\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a01:\u00a0BACTERIAL STRUCTURE\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a02:\u00a0VIRUSES AND THEIR STRUCTURE\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a03:\u00a0FORENSIC MICROBIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a04:\u00a0GENOTYPING TECHNIQUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Microbiology and Forensic Science", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr Sereen M.B Bataineh", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.open2study.com//node/1751", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open2Study"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
