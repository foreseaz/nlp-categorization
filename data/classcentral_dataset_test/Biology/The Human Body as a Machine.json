This course introduces the building blocks that make up the body, and how these are structured and maintained at a cellular level. We highlight the cardiovascular, hormonal and nervous systems, as critical coordination and control parts of the body. We investigate the structure of the musculoskeletal system, and how it helps us move through, and manipulate, our environment. We conclude by reviewing how the body replaces itself to create a new human being.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\n\r\nThe organisational structure of your body\r\nBasic physiological principles that ensure normal body function\r\nThe nature of the basic functional unit of the body, the cell.\r\nThe biology of basic tissue types, such as those lining body surfaces (epithelia) and connecting other tissues (connective tissues)\r\nThe structure and function of the cardiovascular, hormonal and nervous systems, and how they interact to coordinate and control the other systems within your body\r\nThe structure of bone and muscle, and how they work together to allow you to \u00a0move through, and manipulate, your environment\r\nHow DNA helps cells maintain and replace themselves to ensure internal maintenance and renewal within your body\r\nHow your body produces reproductive cells, and how our genetic material is recombined to ensure that, through genetic diversity, we are genetically unique\r\n\r\nWhere could this lead me?\r\nIf you're wondering what your future could look like in this area, here are some potential careers you could head towards.\r\n\r\nMedicine\r\nNursing\r\nAllied health Professions, such as Physiotherapy, OT, Speech Pathology, Audiology, Medical Imaging\r\nBiomedical Engineering\r\nMedical or Laboratory Science\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a01:\u00a0HUMAN BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a02:\u00a0COMMUNICATION AND CO-ORDINATION SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a03:\u00a0MOVING THE MACHINE\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODULE\u00a04:\u00a0MAKING THE MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Human Body as a Machine", "price": 0, "instructors": "Colin Carati", "institution_name": ["Flinders University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.open2study.com//node/1760", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Open2Study"], "start_date": "2016-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
