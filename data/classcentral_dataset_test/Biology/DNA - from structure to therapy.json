Based on milestone experiments, using models and whiteboard sequences, we want to convey our fascination for DNA and provide you with basic knowledge of DNA structure and function to better understand biomedical approaches for diagnostics and therapy.\r\nWhat will I learn?\r\nParticipants will be able to answer the following questions after completing the course:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy and how has DNA become one of the most powerful tools in research?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does DNA look and why is DNA structure so important?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the terms cell division, mitosis, transcription, translation and mutation mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is it so hard to find a cure for cancer?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor which diseases is DNA technology used as a diagnostic tool?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor which diseases may DNA-based technology help developing a therapy?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do I have to know?\r\nIn order to follow our course, basic high school biology and chemistry knowledge is absolutely sufficient. In order to successfully complete all homework assignments, including more in depth questions, you will need some more time and motivation to read further and catch up on certain topics.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-07-28T00:00:00Z", "title": "DNA - from structure to therapy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Susanne Illenberger and Sebastian Springer", "institution_name": ["Jacobs University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://iversity.org/courses/dna-from-structure-to-therapy", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["iversity"], "start_date": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
