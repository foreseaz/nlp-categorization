Did you know that scientists have linked their movement into specific genes to the causes of certain diseases? You\u2019ll also learn how these \u201cjumping genes\u201d work and how scientists study them in Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.\n\nAre you ready to go beyond the\u00a0\u201cwhat\" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?\n\nTake a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in transcription and transposition to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing.\u00a0We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the transcription machinery and mechanisms of transposition. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28.2x Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho can register for this course?\n\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and\u00a0Sudan our license does not cover this course.\n\nSeparately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "7.28.2x: Molecular Biology \u2013 Part 2: Transcription and Transposition", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tania A.
