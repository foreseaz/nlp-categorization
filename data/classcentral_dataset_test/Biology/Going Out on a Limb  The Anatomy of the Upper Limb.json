Next, we cover the osteology of\nthe upper limb by describing the bones of the extremity, how they articulate at synovial joints, and the movements that are possible at these joints. We explore the blood supply and innervation to the upper limb. We then discuss the major muscles that\nact at each joint, pointing out what muscles allow us to shrug our shoulders, row a boat, make a fist, and rotate our hand forwards or backwards.\n\nIn the final three weeks of the course, we investigate nerve injuries that occur in the upper limb and their clinical effects. We also explore common pathologies that appear in the extremity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, and Dupuytren's\ncontracture. We finish with a description of the embryologic development of the upper limb and common causes of limb malformations and deformations.\n\nPlease note that some lectures in this course contain graphic medical images, including illustrations of the human body, and photographs of birth defects and other medical conditions. Discretion is advised.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit 1: Normal Anatomy of the Upper Limb (Weeks 1-6)\nWeek 1 - The Language of Anatomy\n\n    Overview\n    Anatomic Terminology and Limb Regions\n    Osteology and Skeletal Anatomy; Muscle Action\n    Origins and Insertions; Planes of Motion\nWeek 2 - Innervation and Blood Supply of the Upper Limb\n\n\n    The Nervous System: Overview\n    The Brachial Plexus: Motor Innervation\n    The Brachial Plexus: Sensory Innervation; Blood Supply to the Upper Limb\nWeek 3 - The Scapula\n\n\n    Elevation and Depression\n    Protraction, Retraction, Medial Rotation, and Lateral Rotation\nWeek 4 - The Glenohumeral Joint\n\n\n    Structure of the Joint; Flexion and Extension\n    Abduction, Adduction, and the Rotator Cuff\nWeek 5 - The Elbow and Wrist\n\n\n    Elbow: Flexion, Extension, Supination, and Pronation\n    Wrist: Structure of the Joint; Flexion and Extension\nWeek 6 - The Hand\n\n\n    Bony Structure, the Carpal Tunnel, and Extrinsic Muscles of the Hand\n    Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand\n    Extrinsic and Intrinsic Muscles of the Thumb\nUnit 2: Pathology of the Upper Limb (Weeks 7-9)\nWeek 7 - Nerve Injuries\n\n\n    Nerve Injuries 1: Brachial Plexopathies\n    Nerve Injuries 2: The Arm and Forearm\n    Nerve Injuries 3: The Hand\nWeek 8 - Rheumatology\n\n\n    Rheumatoid Arthritis\n    Osteoarthritis\n    Septic Arthritis and Gout\nWeek 9 - Connective Tissue Disease and Embryology\n\n\n    Connective Tissue Diseases: Dupuytren's Contracture, De Quervain Tenosynovitis, and Trigger Finger\n    Embryology 1: Intrinsic Causes of Limb Malformation\n    Embryology 2: Extrinsic Causes of Limb Deformation\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Going Out on a Limb: The Anatomy of the Upper Limb", "price": 0, "instructors": "James White and Alexander Macnow", "institution_name": ["University of Pennsylvania"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/upperlimb", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
