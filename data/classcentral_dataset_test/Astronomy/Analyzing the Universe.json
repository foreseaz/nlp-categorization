The subject matter for this course will be divided into two\nbroad components which will be interwoven in an interdisciplinary fashion. The first is a general introduction to the physics and astronomy\ninformation you will need to understand basic phenomena that occur in the realm\nof x-ray astrophysics; the second is the presentation of authentic satellite\ndata from various exciting types of x-ray sources, which you will analyze to\nbetter understand the working of the high-energy Universe in which we live.\nThere are no prerequisites for this course, other than high-school mathematics\n(algebra and trigonometry). I hope you will enjoy your experience in \"Analyzing the Universe\".\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1:\u00a0 Images, the Nature of Light, and an Introduction to DS9: 6 lectures plus \"wiki\" material supplements\u00a0\n\nLecture 1:\u00a0 \"The Nature of Images\"\u00a0\n        [13:45]\n    Lecture 2:\u00a0 \"Image Formation\"\u00a0\u00a0\n        [14:45]\n    Lecture 3:\u00a0 \"Skipping Stones and X-ray Images\"\u00a0\u00a0\n        [10:23]\n    Lecture 4:\u00a0 \"The Perception of Images\"\u00a0\u00a0\n        [17:34]\n    Lecture 5:\u00a0 \"Introduction to DS9--Part I\"\u00a0\u00a0\n        [6:06]\n    Lecture 6:\u00a0 \"Introduction to DS9--Part II\"\u00a0 [20:02]Homework/Quiz,\u00a0 due\u00a0 27 Sept.
