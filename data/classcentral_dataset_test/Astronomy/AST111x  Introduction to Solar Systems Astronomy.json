We will cover the history of astronomy, properties of light, instruments, the study of the solar system and nearby stars.\n\nThroughout the course, we will learn about the Discovery Channel Telescope, the Lowell Observatory, the Challenger Space Center, and Meteor Crater, the world\u2019s best-preserved meteorite impact site on Earth. We will also get a chance to virtually walk through the Lunar Exploration Museum and Arizona State University\u2019s Moeur Building, home of the Mars Space Flight Facility where ASU scientists and researchers are using spacecraft instruments on Mars to explore the geology and mineralogy of the red planet.\n\nThis course satisfies the Natural Science \u2014 Quantitative (SQ) general studies requirement at Arizona State University. Introduction to Astronomy may satisfy a general education requirement at other institutions; however, it is strongly encouraged that you consult with your institution of choice to determine how these credits will be applied to their degree requirements prior to transferring the credit.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-08-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "AST111x: Introduction to Solar Systems Astronomy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. Frank Timmes", "institution_name": ["Arizona State University"], "commitment": "18 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-solar-systems-astronomy-asux-ast111x-1", "duration": "61 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
