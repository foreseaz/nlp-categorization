Where did the universe come from? How will it end? What is the nature of space and time?\u00a0 For the first time in human history, we can give precise, reliable answers to many cosmological questions, thanks to a spectacular series of recent breakthroughs.\u00a0 But many of the most fundamental mysteries remain unsolved. In this course we will cover the latest advances and the unsolved mysteries. We will explain the recent observations, and with the help of guest speakers Lawrence Krauss and Brian Cox, we will explore the theories behind modern cosmology.\n\nThis course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of astronomy than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level Maths and Physics to get the most out of this course.\n\nThis is one\u00a0of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program. You can take these four courses in any order.\u00a0These courses compromise the Astrophysics XSeries.
