Yet, you will know that carers can face a number of really stressful situations that can be difficult to deal with.\n\nGet advice on connecting with and caring for someone with dementia\n\nThis course will provide you with knowledge and advice that can help you connect with and care for someone living with dementia. We will focus on everyday experiences that are seen as particularly challenging and stressful.\n\nNewcastle University has great expertise in ageing and dementia research. We specialise in understanding dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), so this course will shine a light on some of the stressful symptoms and communication problems associated with this condition, as well as covering the challenges of other types of dementia  including Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nMeet other dementia carers and academic experts\n\nOver the four weeks, you will meet other carers and academic experts who have developed strategies and practical steps that can improve communication - something which is crucially important for building and maintaining relationships, and for effectively negotiating daily life.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop a new understanding of:\n\n\n  the brain and different types of dementia, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB);\n  what a person with dementia is experiencing;\n  challenging situations and behaviours that can cause carer stress;\n  strategies for improving verbal and non-verbal communication;\n  and some of the latest innovations for better communication.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z", "title": "Dementia Care: Staying Connected and Living Well", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lynne Corner", "institution_name": ["Newcastle University"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/dementia-care?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
