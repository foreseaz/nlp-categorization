This has a huge impact on individuals and on society, so improvements in understanding, care and treatments are desperately needed.\n\nIn this free online course you\u2019ll discover some of the key issues in dementia care and research by exploring four less common forms of dementia through the eyes of people affected by the condition, and world-leading experts at UCL. We\u2019ll show how research into the signs, stages, symptoms and causes of less common forms can bring us closer to the aim of defeating dementia.\n\n\u201cI work in a care home with people living with dementia. I will use what I have learned here every day to help me understand and appreciate my residents.\u201d Aileen Callaghan, learner in March 2016\n\nA unique insight\n\nDementia is an umbrella term for a number of diseases, all causing a progressive loss of our ability to think, feel and perceive by affecting how the brain functions. In the four weeks of this course we\u2019ll investigate four forms of dementia that are important to understand better in their own right (they\u2019re often not well recognised), but can also provide important insights that change how we think about dementia in general.\n\nWeek 1 \u2013 What if dementia runs in the family?\nExplore the challenges that face families - and ground-breaking research taking place - with people affected by familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease, where the condition runs in the family and often starts at a young age.\n\nWeek 2 \u2013 What if dementia affects behaviour and personality?\nDementia is not just about memory loss \u2013 we investigate the particular challenges for diagnosis and care for people with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.\n\nWeek 3 \u2013 What if dementia makes you see things that aren\u2019t there?\nSome people with dementia experience hallucinations, and many describe fluctuations in their symptoms over time. These aspects are particularly clear in dementia with Lewy bodies, which you\u2019ll learn about in Week 3.\n\nWeek 4 \u2013 What if dementia affects your vision, not your memory? \nPeople with posterior cortical atrophy experience changes in the way the brain processes visual information; we\u2019ll explore this condition and the research taking place to help people live better with visual impairment related to dementia.\n\n\u201cThe combination of personal stories paralleled by information given by expert clinicians and researchers was very engaging and, coupled with a multitude of interesting comments from course participants, provided a very well-rounded insight into the realities of dementia.\u201d Anne Brink, learner in March 2016\n\nLearn from dementia experts, experts by experience and each other\nThis course is presented by experts from the UCL Institute of Neurology and Division of Psychiatry who are highly regarded for their work as scientists and clinicians. Importantly, you\u2019ll hear from people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and people who care for a family member with dementia to get a better understanding of the impact that a diagnosis of dementia brings.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to understand how dementia affects people by watching video interviews, look deeper into the topics by reading articles, interact through activities and questions, and also learn from others on the course by taking part in the discussions that accompany each step. You can join the conversation now by signing up and visiting the welcome page.\n\n\u201cI am so glad to have signed up to take part in this course. It has been immensely interesting and helpful, and more than anything else, extremely informative.\u201d Laura Ward, learner in March 2016\n\nThis course was created, and is led by Dr Tim Shakespeare, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK Fellow at the Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology.\n\nIn the trailer video, \u201cPiB Pet Images AD\u201d by Klunkwe is adapted &amp; licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Many Faces of Dementia", "price": 0, "instructors": "Tim Shakespeare", "institution_name": ["University College London"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/faces-of-dementia?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
