The course begins with an overview of how infection is established in a host, then moves to a virologist's view of immune defenses. \u00a0Next we consider how the replication strategy and the host response determine the outcome of infection, such that some are short and others are of long duration. The mechanisms by which virus infections transform cells in culture are explored, a process that may lead to tumor formation in animals. We then move to a discussion of how viral infections are controlled by vaccines and antiviral drugs. After an introduction to viral evolution, we discuss the principles learned from zoonotic infections, emerging infections, and humankind's experiences with epidemic and pandemic viral infections. The course ends with an exploration of unusual infectious agents such as viroids, satellites, and prions, followed by a discussion of the causative agent of the most serious current worldwide epidemic, HIV-1.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1Infection basicsEntry into the hostViral spreadTissue invasion and tropismTransmission and seasonality\nWeek 2Innate immune responsesInterferonSentinels and complementInflammationAdaptive immunity\nWeek 3Viral virulenceMechanisms of cell injury IMechanisms of cell injury IIHost susceptibility\nWeek 4Acute infectionsInfluenzaPoliomyelitisMeaslesGastroenteritisWest Nile fever\nWeek 5Persistent infectionsPersistence by modulating the adaptive responseTwo persistent infectionsHerpes simplex virusEpstein-Barr virus\nWeek 6TransformationRNA tumor virusesTransforming retrovirusesDNA tumor virusesEpiphenomena of a unique life styleWeek 7VaccinesHow do you make a vaccine?Inactivated vaccinesAttenuated vaccines\nWeek 8AntiviralsAntiviral discoveryAntiviral resistanceOther antiviral targetsHIV antivirals\nWeek 9Viral evolutionDrivers of evolutionError threshold and bottlenecksSelectionOrigins of viruses\nWeek 10Emerging virusesHost-virus interactionsExamples of emerging virusesSARS and MERSCanine parvovirus\nWeek 11ViroidsSatellitesTransmissible spongiform encephalopathiesPrions\nWeek 12HIV and AIDSThe origin of HIVHIV pathogenesisAn amazing but deadly virus\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-04-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "How Viruses Cause Disease", "price": 0, "instructors": "Vincent Racaniello", "institution_name": ["Columbia University"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/virology2", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
