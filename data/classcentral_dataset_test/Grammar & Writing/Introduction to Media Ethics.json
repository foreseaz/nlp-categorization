Participants will examine social media and new technologies that influence ethical journalism. Lessons and course materials include evaluation of important ethical conflicts in the media.\r\nNews media around the globe must balance a shared goal of providing truthful accounts for citizens with the pressures constantly applied by governments, business, religion and other social forces. A vocabulary and consensus about ethics has emerged in the past half century in countries relatively free of government control to guide news organizations in that balancing act. This course examines the idea of ethical communication, considers the pressures on ethical journalism because of social media and new technologies and places three important ethical conflicts in its spotlight: How can the truth be gathered and shared in rapidly changing circumstances? How can the news media honor fairness and justice when social forces challenge that goal? Can an institution that feeds on violence also play a role in minimizing harm?\r\nCourse Objectives:\r\n\r\nidentify an ethical dilemma, describe the choices faced by the moral agent, and explain the moral implications of each choice;\r\napply key concepts of truthfulness, fairness, respect, autonomy, integrity, and transparency in resolving a dilemma;\r\nevaluate ethical decisions in class forums, drawing on a careful analysis that takes into account levels of fact and historical and social context; and\r\nshow how new and evolving forms of technology affect ethical considerations.\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Introduction to Media Ethics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Roger Simpson Ph.D", "institution_name": ["University of Washington"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/uwashington/courses/introduction-to-media-ethics-1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
