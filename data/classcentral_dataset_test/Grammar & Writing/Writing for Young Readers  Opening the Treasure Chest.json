This module will give you a chance to think about and practice putting yourself into your writing.

We will also discuss ways that you can add depth to your writing by drawing on myths and legends, and by experimenting with different viewpoints.Genre, Form, and AudienceIn this module we will give you an overview of genres and forms that are popular for young readers. We will then move on to a discussion of audience \u2013 who your readers are and how you can make your work appealing to your chosen audience. By the end of the module you will have a good sense of the wide range of genres and forms available to you and some techniques that you can use to make the most of the genre or form you are working in.StructureWe\u2019ve covered qualities of writing that make it appeal to an audience \u2013 its form, its genre, and its strong personal voice. Now we\u2019ll move on to some structural elements that are key to holding your writing together. We\u2019ll start by looking at character and setting, then move on to plot and theme. Finally, we will focus on language. Language can really bring your writing to life by adding a layer to your characters and setting and by giving your plot a good pace.

Then we\u2019ll move on to the copyediting and proofreading stage, where you focus on perfecting grammar and spelling. We have provided resources and checklists that will help you to practice applying our editing tips to your own work.PublishingIn this final module you\u2019ll learn about different ways that you can get your work published and into the hands of young readers.
