The personal costs are staggering, with falls resulting in injury, broken bones, fear of falling and social isolation.\n\nPeople fall because of a complex mix of factors. To reduce falling, it is important to identify these factors, and recognise those that could signify serious, but treatable, underlying medical problems.\n\nThis interactive course will enable you to:\n\n\n  Learn more about why falls are just so important\n  Discover ways of assessing and reducing the risk of falling\n  Recognise when to seek help\n  Explore how to prevent falls and injury\n\n\nDuring the course, we will meet people who have been affected by falls through a series of video case studies, and discuss together the important issues they raise, which we hope will be informative, practical and enlightening.\n\nWe will draw on the knowledge and experience of world leading experts at Newcastle University through our Meet the Experts series. This includes work with the award winning Falls and Syncope Service (FASS) at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Victoria Infirmary - the largest unit of its kind in Europe, recognised internationally for its innovative work in the field of falls and blackouts.\n\nYou can find out more about this course in Professor Julia Newton\u2019s blog post: \u201cFalls are not a normal part of ageing.\u201d\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-10-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "Ageing Well: Falls", "price": 0, "instructors": "Julia Newton and James Frith", "institution_name": ["Newcastle University"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/falls?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
