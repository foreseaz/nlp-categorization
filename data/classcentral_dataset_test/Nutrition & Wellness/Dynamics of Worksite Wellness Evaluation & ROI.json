It is comprised of four sessions that focus on the fundamentals of planning an evaluation; how to identify and gather appropriate data to build an evaluation framework; how to prepare a break-even analysis to determine the financial feasibility of a new wellness program, activity, or policy; and, how to prepare a basic benefit-cost/ROI analysis to determine the financial value of an existing worksite wellness program, activity, or policy.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-12-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Dynamics of Worksite Wellness Evaluation & ROI", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dr. David Chenoweth", "institution_name": ["University of Wisconsin-Extension"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/dynamics-of-worksite-wellness-evaluation-roi", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
