We\u2019ll also look at the history and underpinnings of much leadership theorising to understand the ideas of power, authority and charisma.In later modules we explore the dominant leadership theories and the need for a new approach to leadership. Under this new psychology of leadership \u2013 also known as the Social Identity theory of Leadership - we uncover 4 rules for leadership built upon an understanding of group psychological processes rather than the individual psychology of leaders.We conclude with the key skills and practices of leadership \u2013 skills and practices that you can learn and perfect.
