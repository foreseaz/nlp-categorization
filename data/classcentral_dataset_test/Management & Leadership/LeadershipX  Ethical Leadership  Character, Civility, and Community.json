The ELT is an instrument for leaders who engage the complex ethical questions in public space and includes the following: Ethical Leadership Model; Ethical Decision-Making Model; Ways of Doing Ethics; Remembering, Retelling and Reliving Stories; and Looking, Listening and Learning. Participants will be invited to develop their own Ethical Leadership Toolkit through video exercises led by Professor Fluker, survey questions, discussion forums, journaling and assessments.\n\nStudents who pass this course are eligible to take a 6 week online addendum course and receive graduate credits as a non-matriculating student from Boston University. The addendum course will go deeper into the MOOC material with discussion, readings and written assignments.
