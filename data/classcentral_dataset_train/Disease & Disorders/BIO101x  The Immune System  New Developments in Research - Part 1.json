Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the \u201cenemies of human life\u201d have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.\n\u00a0\nDuring this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications. \u00a0We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.\n\u00a0\nThe part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.\nThe first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.\n\u00a0Program :\nWeek 1.
