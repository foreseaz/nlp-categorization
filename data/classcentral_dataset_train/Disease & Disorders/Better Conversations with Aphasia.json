Aphasia is a language disorder commonly caused by stroke that affects speaking, listening, reading and writing, and as a result everyday conversations can become difficult.\r\n\r\nSLTs will learn how to do conversation therapy, have access to a complete therapy programme, interactive learning materials, and advice from experienced clinicians. PWA and their families will find out what conversation therapy is, what other PWA think of it, and be able to reflect on whether it is right for them. Video and audio materials are at the heart of the resource. Healthcare workers and medics who deal with people with aphasia and their family members will learn how aphasia affects everyday conversation, what conversation therapy is, and the evidence base for its efficacy.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Better Conversations with Aphasia", "price": 0, "instructors": "Suzanne Beeke", "institution_name": ["University College London"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://extendstore.ucl.ac.uk/product?catalog=UCLXBCA", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2014-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
