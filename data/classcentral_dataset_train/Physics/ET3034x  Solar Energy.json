This course introduces the technology that converts solar energy into electricity, heat and solar fuels with a main focus on electricity generation.\u00a0Photovoltaic (PV)\u00a0devices are presented as advanced semiconductor devices that deliver electricity directly from sunlight. The emphasis is on understanding the working principle of a solar cell, fabrication of solar cells, PV module construction and the design of a PV system. You will gain a greater understanding of the principles of the photovoltaic conversion\u2014 the conversion of light into electricity. This course explores the advantages, limitations and challenges of different solar cell technologies, such as crystalline silicon solar cell technology, thin film solar cell technologies and the latest novel solar cell concepts as studied on lab-scale. We will discuss the specifications of solar modules and demonstrate how to design a complete solar system for any particular application.\n\nEducation Method\n\nThe class will consist of a collection of eight to twelve minute lecture videos, exercises, assignments and exams. Specified assignments and the three exams will determine the final grade. The new textbook on \u201cSolar Energy, basics, technology and systems\u201d from the Delft University of Technology will be available for the students on-line\u00a0and free of charge.\u00a0Your course staff will encourage and challenge you to learn from, and interact with, your fellow students by helping each other and sharing ideas and best practices, in the course forum.\u00a0We were happy to see the incredible number of interesting student videos on solar energy systems from all over the world in the previous edition of this course.\u00a0\n\nLICENSE\n\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-08-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "ET3034x: Solar Energy", "price": 0, "instructors": "Arno Smets", "institution_name": ["Delft University of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/solar-energy-delftx-et3034x-0", "duration": "53 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
