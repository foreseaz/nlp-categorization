The subject heat transfer has a wide scope and is of prime importance in almost all fields of engineering and biological systems. The course emphasizes the underlying concepts of the conduction and convection modes of heat transfer and enumerates the laws and governing equations relating to the rates of heat transfer, based on derivation from fundamentals. There is a well balanced coverage of physical concepts, mathematical operations along with examples and exercise problems of practical importance. After completion of the course, the students will have a strong foundation on conduction and convection heat transfer and will be able to apply the basic principles, the laws, and the pertinent equations to practical scenarios.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        1.
