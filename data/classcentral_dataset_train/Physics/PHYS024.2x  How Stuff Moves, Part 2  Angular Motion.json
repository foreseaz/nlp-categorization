It was the first quantitative science to achieve wide power to predict behavior, including things never before directly observed. Newton, Leibniz, and others invented calculus to describe motion and we will find both differential and integral calculus extremely useful throughout this course.\n\nThis is the second in a 3-part series of courses that parallels the second-semester mechanics course taught at Harvey Mudd College. Part 2 expands on Part 1 by considering the rotation of objects, connecting new concepts of angular momentum and torque to the properties of linear motion.\u00a0Part 1\u00a0examined linear motion, and Part 3 examines wave motion.\u00a0This course is an invitation to develop your problem-solving skills and to learn how to apply mathematics to all sorts of problems of the physical world. Learning the rules that govern how stuff moves in the world around us is\u00a0exciting; using those rules to predict\u00a0correctly\u00a0something that you haven\u2019t observed means that you\u00a0really understand something. It\u2018s a great feeling.\n\nWHAT SHOULD I KNOW BEFORE WE START?\nYou need not have taken physics before, but we assume that you have studied mathematics, up to and including a first course in calculus. You may be taking a calculus course concurrently with this course; that should be a good strategy. We will introduce important calculus ideas and methods as the need arises and provide examples.\n\nThere is a Mathematics Diagnostic Test that you can take at the beginning of Part 1 of this series to ensure that your mathematics background will set you up for success in this course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-04-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "PHYS024.2x: How Stuff Moves, Part 2: Angular Motion", "price": 0, "instructors": "Elizabeth Connolly and Peter Saeta", "institution_name": ["Harvey Mudd College"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/how-stuff-moves-part-2-angular-motion-harveymuddx-phys024-2x", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
