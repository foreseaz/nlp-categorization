Engineers today gather huge data and seek meaningful knowledge out of these for interpreting the process behaviour. Scientists do experiments under controlled environment and analyse them to confirm or reject hypotheses. Managers and administrators use the results out of data analysis for day to day decision making. As the data collected and stored are multidimensional, to extract knowledge out of it requires statistical analysis in the multivariate domain. The aim of this course is therefore to build confidence in the students in analysing and interpreting multivariate data.\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Applied Multivariate Statistical Modeling", "price": 0, "instructors": "Jhareswar Maiti", "institution_name": ["Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_ma04", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2016-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
