It will be taught at an introductory level for students with junior or senior college-level mathematical training including a working knowledge of calculus. A small amount of linear algebra and programming are useful for the class, but not required.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction, Probability, Expectations, and Random VectorsYou are about to undergo an intense and demanding immersion into the world of mathematical biostatistics. Over the next few weeks, you will learn about probability, expectations, conditional probabilities, distributions, confidence intervals, bootstrapping, binomial proportions, and much more. Module 1 covers experiments, probability, variables, mass functions, density functions, cumulative distribution functions, expectations, variations, and vectors.Conditional Probability, Bayes' Rule, Likelihood, Distributions, and AsymptoticsThis module covers  Conditional Probability, Bayes' Rule, Likelihood, Distributions, and Asymptotics. These are the most fundamental core concepts in mathematical biostatistics and statistics. After this module you should be able to recognize and be functional in these key concepts. Confidence Intervals, Bootstrapping, and PlottingThis module covers  Confidence Intervals, Bootstrapping, and Plotting. These are core concepts in mathematical biostatistics and statistics. After this module you should be able to recognize and be functional in these key concepts.\nBinomial Proportions and LogsThis module covers Binomial Proportions and Logs. These are core concepts in mathematical biostatistics and statistics. After this module you should be able to recognize and be functional in these key concepts. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Brian Caffo", "institution_name": ["Johns Hopkins University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
