Yes, we\u2019re always hearing about Google, Uber, and all those \u201cpirate entrepreneurs.\u201d Yes, we know technology has something to do with it. But the future is approaching even more quickly that we think. Right now, all the pieces are in place to completely change the face of products, technologies, organizations, and entrepreneurship over the next few years. This module will tell you how and why.Creating Value in a Digital WorldOnce upon a time, the rules of the game were simple. People worked away in their offices to develop and sell products or services, and shared the margin between price and cost. But now this product-based way of competing is all but gone \u2013 wiped out by the new principles of value creation. Going digital means playing by new rules, powered by network effects and system goods, that radically changed the fundamentals of business. Now, people create value outside their offices by connecting in third places, and the best way to turn a profit can be to give your products away, or share your knowledge, for free. Across the board, old-style value chains are being completely disrupted by new business ecosystems.Thinking and acting differentlyGoing digital is a bit like emigrating to another country. To succeed digitally, people and firms need to adopt a whole new mindset. Entrepreneurs should forget about building the perfect business plan, and instead put the focus on \u201ctrial and learn\u201d processes. And companies should forget about long-term strategy, protecting their IP, product planning, and entry barriers, and concentrate on running instead of defending. This is true in every area from strategic decision-making through to getting the most from the assets that firms own, control, or use \u2013 knowledge assets in particular.Entrepreneurship in a Digital WorldWe usually think of the entrepreneur\u2019s challenge as coming up with a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d But the new digital world doesn\u2019t work on belief alone. Promises, and ideas\u2019 potential, must be based on tangible facts. That\u2019s why execution is so much more important than ideas. This module looks at the new context for entrepreneurs and the skills they need to succeed, including the supreme importance of execution, the key things every successful startup must do, and the essential skill of pitching ideas. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "Innovating in a Digital World", "price": 0, "instructors": "R\u00e9mi Maniak, Laurent Gille, Val\u00e9rie Fernandez and Thomas Houy", "institution_name": ["Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/innovating-digital-world", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
