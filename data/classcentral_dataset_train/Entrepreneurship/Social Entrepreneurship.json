Increasingly business graduates are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality. A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made.As part of the course you will be working in groups on identifying an opportunity for a social innovation or social enterprise. You will then write a business plan outlining the business model for implementing your idea. All business plans will be evaluated at the end of the course and the winners will be supported in the implementation of their idea.Below you can find the list of the top 10 -\u00a0the\u00a0winners of the business plan competition\u00a0from the previous MOOC:Winners of the Business Plan Competition1st prize\u00a0Meds4all\u00a02nd prize\u00a0Super Kids Academy\u00a03rd\u00a0prize\u00a0Mobilize\u00a03rd\u00a0prize EntreLaunch\u00a03rd\u00a0prize Beyond Laundry\u00a0Runner-upsCommunity Micro Grids\u00a0The Shepherd's Den\u00a0GrowsocialBeitel Kl\u00fcpfel - To Craft Is To Care\u00a0Zero Waste Shop\u00a0Be sure to follow us on:https://twitter.com/cbsSENThttps://www.facebook.com/cbsSENTOr follow Prof. Hockerts at:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Kai_Hockertshttps://www.facebook.com/khockerts... where we will post news and information about the field of Social Entrepreneurship and this course. \n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Intro:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction to the CourseWeek 1: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is Social Entrepreneurship?Week 2: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who is a Social Entrepreneur?Week 3: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to Identify an Opportunity?Week\u00a04: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating a Business ModelWeek\u00a05: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Business Model CanvasWeek\u00a06: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Writing a Business PlanWeek\u00a07: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Selecting an Organizational FormWeek\u00a08: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Attracting InvestorsWeek\u00a09: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measuring Social ImpactWeek 10: \u00a0 Communication Strategies for Social EnterprisesWeek 11: \u00a0 Replication StrategyWeek 12: \u00a0 Exit Strategies\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-07-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Social Entrepreneurship", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kai  Hockerts", "institution_name": ["Copenhagen Business School"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/socialentrepeneur", "duration": "12 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
