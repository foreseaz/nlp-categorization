Now how do you figure out if there is a sustainable business model to get this innovation into the hands of your customers? This 5-week course from +Acumen &amp; Santa Clara University's Global Social Benefit Institute will help you think through how you can create financial value while delivering products or services to the poor. You'll learn about 5 social enterprise models that Acumen has seen effectively create value, and then you'll use the business model canvas to map out components of your own potential company. You'll analyze your value chain\u2014from manufacturing to distribution\u2014and determine the stages you want to get involved in vs. where you'll need to partner with other key players. You'll walk away from this course with hypotheses about the size of your target market, the key business partners you'll need to reach out to, and potential cost structures and revenue streams. While this course will not delve into the intricacies of financial modeling, you'll emerge with a big-picture understanding of the key components to consider if you are building a business that prioritizes social impact and strives for financial sustainability.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-27T00:00:00Z", "title": "Social Enterprise Models", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "2 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/business-models-fall-2015", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2015-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
