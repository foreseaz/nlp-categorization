This 5 module course aims to equip you with the mindset and skills needed to access the capital to support the growth of your business. In this course you learn to interpret financial statements in order to understand the capital needed for growth, the types of capital available, and the process for connecting what you need with what is available. This course was built in partnership with Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women and Babson College, a world leader in entrepreneurship education.\r\nThe course will begin with an opportunity for introspection. You'll reflect on what it means to be a business owner with an entrepreneurial orientation. Then, you will learn the basics of financial statements and understand how to use them in strategic planning and communicating to potential capital providers. You'll learn from case studies and examples of how other women business owners have applied these skills to grow their business. Finally, we will walk you through how to develop growth projections, a form of storytelling built on numbers that you can leverage as you develop your entrepreneurial vision and seek funding.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-06T00:00:00Z", "title": "Access to Capital for Women: Capturing Opportunities to Grow Your Business", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen", "Babson College", "Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women"], "commitment": "4-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/women-capital-access", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-07-12T00:00:00Z"}
