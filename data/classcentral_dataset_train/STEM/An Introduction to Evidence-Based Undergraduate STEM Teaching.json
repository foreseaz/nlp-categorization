Participants will learn about effective teaching strategies and the research that supports them, and they will apply what they learn to the design of lessons and assignments they can use in future teaching opportunities.  Those who complete the course will be more informed and confident teachers, equipped for greater success in the undergraduate classroom. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe course will draw on the expertise of experienced STEM faculty, educational researchers, and staff from university teaching centers, many of them affiliated with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL), a network of 21 research universities collaborating in the preparation of STEM graduate students and post-docs as future faculty members.  The eight-week course will be highly interactive, with many opportunities for peer-to-peer learning.  Learning communities are at the heart of CIRTL\u2019s activities, and this open, online course is intended to foster a large, healthy learning community of those interested in undergraduate STEM teaching--including current STEM faculty. \"An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching\" has been developed by faculty, staff, and students at Vanderbilt University, Michigan State University, Boston University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Colorado-Boulder.\u00a0The course is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1347605.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 \u2013 Principles of Learning, Part 1We start by exploring a few key learning principles that apply in all \nteaching contexts such as student\u2019s prior knowledge, mental models and \nknowledge organization. We\u2019ll consider the research supporting these \nprinciples and examples of how STEM faculty put them into practice.Week 2 \u2013 Principles of Learning, Part 2This week we continue our exploration of\u00a0learning principles that apply \nin all teaching contexts. \u00a0These include, effective ways of providing \nfeedback to students and student motivations for learning. We\u2019ll \nconsider the research supporting these principles and examples of how \nSTEM faculty put them into practice.Week 3 \u2013 Learning ObjectivesDesigning an effective learning experience for students means beginning \nwith the end in mind. In this week, we will identify ways to craft \nmeaningful learning objectives for one\u2019s students and discuss \nstrategies\u00a0for incorporating those objectives in your instruction.Week 4 \u2013 Assessment of LearningOnce we have outlined and implemented our learning objectives we must \nconsider the most effective way of assessing those learning objectives. \n\u00a0This week we will discuss strategies for designing assessments that \nwill align with your learning goals as well as how student mindset can \ninfluence their performance on these assessments.Week 5 \u2013 Active LearningThe module begins with a description of the benefits of active learning \nand how it fits into the overall learning cycle. Then, the module \noutlines two key features of active learning, teamwork and critical \nthinking, by showcasing several manifestations of active learning.Week 6 \u2013 Inclusive TeachingThis week we will discuss the importance of inclusive teaching and many \nof the issues instructors can face when teaching classes composed of \nstudents of varying ethnicities and genders. \u00a0We provide you with \nexamples of teaching practices and language that can isolate certain \nstudent populations along with strategies to avoid these practices.Week 7 \u2013 Lesson PlanningThis week you will create an annotated lesson plan for a class you might teach in the future incorporating many of the principles covered in this course.Week 8 \u2013 ConclusionDuring the final week of the course, you'll provide feedback to your \npeers on their draft lesson plans and, in turn, receive feedback on your\n lesson plan.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-11-23T00:00:00Z", "title": "An Introduction to Evidence-Based Undergraduate STEM Teaching", "price": 0, "instructors": "Derek Bruff, Rique Campa, Trina  McMahon and Bennett  Goldberg", "institution_name": ["Vanderbilt University"], "commitment": "4-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/stemteaching", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
