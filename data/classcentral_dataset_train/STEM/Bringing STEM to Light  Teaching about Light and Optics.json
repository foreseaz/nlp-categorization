{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["STEM"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Light is a fascinating and familiar topic for children and adults. It\u2019s also rich and complex, which is great if you are teaching a graduate level course in Quantum Mechanics. But how do you lay the foundation for this exciting topic? What do you teach to the youngest would-be scientists?\r\nThis self-paced, 5 week course is designed for both formal and informal educators who want to teach children ages 6-14 about the science of light and optics.\r\nStarting with a simple kit and some basic activities, we\u2019ll work through understanding the basics of light, color, shadows, reflection and refraction. Each module offers easy to digest science content, application of science process skills, connections to real world technologies and engaging activities designed to build your comfort and confidence with light and optics. Throughout each module, guidance (suggestions) on how to use and create learning experiences for children will be provided through online discussions and other opportunities for self-reflection and sharing. This process will support the completion of a final project.\r\n\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z", "title": "Bringing STEM to Light: Teaching about Light and Optics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Colette DeHarpporte, MA", "institution_name": ["LASER Classroom"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/laserclassroom/courses/light-and-optics-1", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
