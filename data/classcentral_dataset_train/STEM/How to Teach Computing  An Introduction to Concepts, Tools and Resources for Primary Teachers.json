And nearly all future jobs require us to understand it. To respond to this,\u00a0governments are including computing in national curricula\u00a0for students of all ages. In the UK already\u00a0every primary school teacher has to teach computing concepts\u00a0and in many other countries more and more of us will be required to teach computing or at least integrate computing concepts, ideas and processes into our teaching. So let's get ready for this.\r\nIf you are a primary school teacher who needs\u00a0ideas, tools or resources on how to teach computing, this MOOC is here to help you. We will be exploring the\u00a0ideas, concepts, processes and skills that are important\u00a0in computing and then\u00a0introduce you to the tools and resources that can help you\u00a0teach these concepts and processes in the classroom.\r\nThe course is designed as\u00a0an introductory course, for you to use as a starting point to explore some of the ideas and tools further. It is relevant to\u00a0primary school teachers\u00a0of all levels of experience. A basic amount of knowledge on operating computers and other technology devices is expected but you don't need prior knowledge of computing. The course lasts for\u00a05 weeks\u00a0and requires around\u00a02 hours of work per week.\r\nThe course has been designed\u00a0by teachers for teachers\u00a0and will feature interviews, presentations, and activities from teachers, professors, students and computing professionals.\r\nEnrol in the course and\u00a0join the discussion\u00a0on our social media channels via the\u00a0Facebook group\u00a0and Twitter using #CScourse.\r\nThis course is an adapted version of the\u00a0How to Teach Computing: An Introduction to Concepts, Tools and Resources for Secondary Teachers course. If you have previously participated in this course you will be familiar with a number of sections of the course for primary teachers.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "How to Teach Computing: An Introduction to Concepts, Tools and Resources for Primary Teachers", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["European Schoolnet Academy"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/how-to-teach-computing-", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
