Topics include affirmative action, income distribution, same-sex marriage, the role of markets, debates about rights (human rights and property rights), arguments for and against equality, dilemmas of loyalty in public and private life. The course invites learners to subject their own views on these controversies to critical examination.\n\nThe principal readings for the course are texts by Aristotle, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. Other assigned readings include writings by contemporary philosophers, court cases, and articles about political controversies that raise philosophical questions.\n\nClosed Captioning and discussion forums are available in Chinese, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n\nHarvardX requires individuals who enroll in its courses on edX to abide by the terms of the\u00a0edX honor code.
