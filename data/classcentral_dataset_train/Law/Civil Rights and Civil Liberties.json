We will look specifically at establishment and free exercise; free speech, including obscene speech; 4th Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures; the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination; 8th Amendment prohibitions against cruel and usual punishment; as well as related cases that have recognized rights of historically marginalized groups in United States history, including African-Americans, women, and sexual minorities through these Amendments. Particular attention will be paid to how the Supreme Court has developed arguments which have expanded and contracted \u201crights\u201d and \u201cliberties.\u201d We will also pay close attention to larger political contexts apart from court decisions that contribute to the overall development of \u201ccivil rights and civil liberties\u201d in the United States.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "Civil Rights and Civil Liberties", "price": 0, "instructors": "Justin Wert, PhD", "institution_name": ["The University of Oklahoma"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "https://janux.ou.edu/course.tag-nextthought-com-2011-10-nti-courseinfo-fall2016-psc-4283.html", "duration": "16 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Janux"], "start_date": "2016-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
