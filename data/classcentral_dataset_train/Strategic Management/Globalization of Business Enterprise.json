It\nwill focus on the differences between countries that underlie observed levels\nof globalization and their implications for business. These differences will be summarized in terms\nof a framework for thinking about distances developed by Professor Ghemawat\nthat is widely used at leading business schools around the world.\n\nThe final part of the course will synthesize the\nimplications of globalization for business strategies\u2014and for your personal\ndevelopment and career trajectories. \u00a0Praise\"Pankaj Ghemawat is one of those rare individuals who combines world class scholarship with a deep knowledge of business practice.\"\u00a0Michael E.

This module will focus on these and others differences such as availability (or lack) of resources, inputs, infrastructure\n    and complements, and organizational capabilities.\n\nSession\u00a07: The Implications of Distances for Business Strategy\n\nThis\nsession will review three broad strategies for dealing with differences: \u00a0Adaptation\nto adjust to differences across countries to achieve some local responsiveness;\nAggregation, to overcome some of the\ndifferences across countries and thereby unlock \u00a0cross-border economies of scale/scope; and Arbitrage to exploit some of \u00a0the\ndifferences across countries in order to achieve absolute efficiency. \n\n\nSession 8: The Implications of Distances for Personal Strategy\n\nThis session will focus on the individual rather than the company level and will discuss, in particular, some of the implications for personal development. It will also provide a course summary.\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Globalization of Business Enterprise", "price": 0, "instructors": "Pankaj Ghemawat", "institution_name": ["IESE Business School"], "commitment": "3-7 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/globe", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
