You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued \u2013 by the Dutch East India Company \u2013 to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.  By the end of the course, you will have developed insight into the intersections of the financial markets with worlds of policy, politics, and power. You will have demonstrated that insight by teaching an important financial concept and translating a financial product or transaction to someone who will clearly benefit from your advice.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Welcome &amp; Interest RatesWelcome!
