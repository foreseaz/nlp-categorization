The specific decision rules we will analyze include:\n\nPayback\n\tInternal Rate of Return\n\tNet Present Value\nThe relation between these different decision rules and value creation, or equivalently shareholder wealth maximization, will be emphasized. The foundational framework of time value of money will be used to introduce the concepts and applications, and to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative decision criteria. This will be followed by an exposure to the valuation of bond/debt and stocks/shares. This course will also involve some basic exposure to how the profitability of projects is measured in the real world.\n\nThis course is targeted to managers working in corporations or institutions and individuals planning to pursue a graduate degree in business (MBA).\n\nThis course is part of the Corporate Financial Analysis XSeries.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2018-11-06T00:00:00Z", "title": "FIN401x: Financial Decision Rules for Project Evaluation", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gautam Kaul", "institution_name": ["University of Michigan"], "commitment": "30-40 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/financial-decision-rules-project-michiganx-fin401x", "duration": "105 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
