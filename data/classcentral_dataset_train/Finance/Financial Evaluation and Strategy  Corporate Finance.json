The orientation also helps you obtain the technical skills required for the course.Module 1: The Objective of the Corporation and Analysis of Financial RatiosIn Module 1, we will discuss the objectives of the corporation. We will introduce the concept of shareholder value and discuss the pros and cons of maximizing stock prices. We will then learn how to calculate financial ratios that measure concepts such as liquidity, leverage, and profitability. We will work with accounting statements and financial data from real world companies and learn how to use this data to measure the financial health of companies and make comparisons with competitors.Module 2: Financial PlanningIn Module 2, we will learn models that allow us to forecast and manage a company's short-term investments such as capital expenditures. We will forecast the future financial statements of a real world company and learn how to figure out how much external financing the company will need. We will then use real world examples to learn how short-term investments in working capital determine a company's need for short-term financing.Module 3: Making Investment DecisionsIn Module 3, we will learn tools that allow us to measure the contribution of a new investment to shareholder value. We will learn how to calculate the net present value (NPV) of an investment and how to use the NPV to make a decision on whether to make the investment or not. We will also learn to calculate the rate of return (IRR) on an investment project and how to properly use the IRR in investment decisions. Finally, we will learn how to incorporate real options into investment analysis to be able to make decisions about investments such as R&amp;D (research and development).Module 4: Mergers and Acquisitions, Risk, and Performance EvaluationIn Module 4, we will apply our investment valuation tools to understand when a merger between two companies creates shareholder value. We will learn to distinguish between good and bad reasons for companies to engage in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), and we will learn how to price an M&amp;A deal. We will also learn the specific characteristics of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and how they can create value for shareholders. We will then learn how to incorporate risk into investment valuation by changing discount rates. We will calculate the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) for a real world company and learn how to use WACC to value investments and to measure the performance of the company or a division of the company.Course Conclusion\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Financial Evaluation and Strategy: Corporate Finance", "price": 0, "instructors": "Heitor Almeida", "institution_name": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], "commitment": "4-6 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/corporate-finance", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
