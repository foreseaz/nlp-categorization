How credit works? How and why insurance products like life insurance, health insurance, and property insurance might be relevant for you? How to maximize your retirement savings? This course aims to make finding the answers to these questions, and many other similar questions, interesting and fun.\n\nThis personal finance course is divided into four modules: investments, credit, insurance and retirement. Each module is independent and may be studied on its own, although studying them together provides a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness across modules and the various tradeoffs across them.\n\nThroughout the course, we will explore interesting and relevant real world examples so that you can better understand the underlying concepts. We will also relate relevant academic research to the topic on hand and show how the research findings are relevant to your daily financial decisions.\n\nThis course provides practical, ready-to-use solutions to use in your daily life. All solutions may not be equally important for you given your age and priorities, but they will certainly be relevant to you at some point in your life.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-08-10T00:00:00Z", "title": "FINANCEx: Personal Finance Planning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sugato Chakravarty", "institution_name": ["Purdue University"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/personal-finance-planning-purduex-financex", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
