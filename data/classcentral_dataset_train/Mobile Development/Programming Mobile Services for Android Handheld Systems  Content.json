Throughout the MOOC we'll focus on pattern-oriented software architecture, with an emphasis on concurrent and networked programming in the context of Android middleware systems programming mechanisms, such as Content Resolvers, Content Providers, SQLite, and SyncAdapters. We illustrate by example how key pattern and framework concepts and relationships are applied to develop Content Providers that mediate access to cloud services from both an application and infrastructure perspective. Many code examples are shown throughout using Java, with a case study project used to reify the key points throughout all the modules in this MOOC.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems: Content", "price": 0, "instructors": "Douglas Schmidt", "institution_name": ["Vanderbilt University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/posacontent", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2016-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
