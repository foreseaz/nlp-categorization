{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Data Science and Big Data"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Spark is rapidly becoming the compute engine of choice for big data. Spark programs are more concise and often run 10-100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce jobs. As companies realize this, Spark developers are becoming increasingly valued.\n\nThis statistics and data analysis course will teach you the basics of working with Spark and will provide you with the necessary foundation for diving deeper into Spark. You\u2019ll learn about Spark\u2019s architecture and programming model, including commonly used APIs. After completing this course, you\u2019ll be able to write and debug basic Spark applications. This course will also explain how to use Spark\u2019s web user interface (UI), how to recognize common coding errors, and how to proactively prevent errors. The focus of this course will be Spark Core and Spark SQL.\n\nThis course covers advanced undergraduate-level material. It requires a programming background and experience with Python (or the ability to learn it quickly). All exercises will use PySpark (the Python API for Spark), but previous experience with Spark or distributed computing is NOT required. Students should take this Python mini-quiz before the course and take this Python mini-course if they need to learn Python or refresh their Python knowledge.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "CS105x: Introduction to Apache Spark", "price": 0, "instructors": "Anthony D.
