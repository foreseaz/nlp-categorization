Again the emphasis is on principles and practical data mining using Weka, rather than mathematical theory or advanced details of particular algorithms. Students will work with multimillion-instance datasets, classify text, experiment with clustering, association rules, neural networks, and much more.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "More Data Mining with Weka", "price": 0, "instructors": "Ian H.
