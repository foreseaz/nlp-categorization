{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Philosophy"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    This is the seconding\u00a0reading in our series on \u201cReadings that Matter\u201d. This series is adapted from a set of readings that Acumen\u2019s Fellows and staff discuss\u00a0on a regular basis as part of our leadership training and development.\r\n\r\n\u201cA person\u2019s identity \u2026 is like a pattern drawn on a tightly stretched parchment. Touch just one part of it, just one allegiance, and the whole person will react, the whole drum will sound.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why Amin Maalouf, the Lebanese-born French author of\u00a0\u201cIn the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong\u201c, calls identity a \u201cfalse friend.\u201d\u00a0 Throughout history, most large-scale acts of violence\u2014whether the genocides, the Holocaust, or wars\u2014have been committed in the name of identity: one tribe against another, one religion against another, one nation against another.\r\nAs Maria Popova aptly\u00a0observes, \u201cAll violence requires an Other as its target, and the shifting boundaries of our own identity are what contours that otherness.\u201d It is only through exploration of how we understand our own identities that we can unpack where our sense of \u201cother\u201d comes from: how it is constructed, and how it can be pulled apart to create more productive dialogue and deeper mutual understanding. These questions are increasingly relevant at a time when terrorism, extremism, mass shootings and protests proliferate, while our capacity to discuss and understand such events can feel stagnant.\r\nIn this course, you\u2019ll have a chance to join a global conversation about Maalouf\u2019s writings and larger questions of identity in light of current events.\u00a0 You\u2019ll receive a discussion kit complete with a downloadable version of the text, a step-by-step facilitator\u2019s guide and background materials that will equip you to host a small group of friends or colleagues in a 2-hour discussion of the first five chapters of Maalouf\u2019s book. The course will also give you tools to reflect on your own identity and think about it in relation to the larger historical and cultural factors that Maalouf lays out.\r\nOne of the most important takeaways from Maalouf\u2019s book is that our identities are multi-faceted, evolving, and resist easy definitions. To that end, we do not propose that this course and group discussion will bring you to any resolution regarding your own identity, or any clear understanding about why so many commit acts of violence and aggression in the name of identity.\u00a0 Yet, as Maalouf himself says, \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t prevent us from observing, from trying to understand, from discussing, and sometimes suggesting a subject for reflection.\u201d\r\nMaalouf\u2019s \u201cIn the Name of Identity\u201d does not offer easy answers.\u00a0 Yet his writings serve as a powerful exploration of the multiple dimensions of identity, the roots of violence and tribalism, and the value of embracing multiple allegiances and affiliations.\u00a0 Please join us in this important global conversation.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://plusacumen.org/courses/in-the-name-of-identity-violence-and-the-need-to-belong/", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2016-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
