In classrooms that are\nEmotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and\nexcited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know\nthat, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood\n    teacher? Teachers need many types of knowledge \u2013 knowledge about children\u2019s\n    development, about the content they\u2019re teaching, about effective teaching\n    practices, about the needs and abilities of the children in their classrooms,\n    and about themselves. In this course we\u2019ll focus a bit on knowledge about\n    children\u2019s development and we\u2019ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge\n    about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and\n    development.\nAnother part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge\n    in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good\n    teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like \u2013 in lots of different\n    types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers\n    tell us they don\u2019t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers\n    teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get\n    them. We\u2019ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom\n    videos and we\u2019ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach.\nUltimately we can\u2019t learn to be an effective teacher without practice\n    \u2013 we need to spend some time doing \u2013 enacting the teaching practices\n    that we\u2019ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really\n    learn about them \u2013 you need to spend some time practicing the types of\n    interactions we\u2019ll be talking about.\nThere\u2019s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective\u00a0\n    teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this\n    a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying\n    glass \u2013 we\u2019ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have\n    learned throughout this course.\nMuch of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget\n    Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom\n    Assessment Scoring System \u2013 or CLASS(\u2122). CLASS is an observational measure\n    used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective\n    teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching\n    practices assessed by the CLASS. And you will get opportunities to observe\n    and analyze your own teaching practice in ways that have been shown to\n    increase the effectiveness of teachers' interactions with young children.\u00a0\u00a0\n \n  \n  *********************************************************************\n  \n \n\n\nThe development of the course was funded, in part, by the\nInstitute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grant\nR305A100154-11 to the University of Virginia.\u00a0\nThe opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not represent\nviews of the U.S. Department of Education.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One \u2013 Creating Emotionally Supportive\nClassrooms: We\u2019ll take a closer look at the importance of interactions and the\npower that teachers have in the development of young children. This week will\ninclude an overview of the areas and dimensions of the Teaching through\nInteractions Framework. For this course, we\u2019ll focus specifically on the area\nof Emotional Support.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek Two \u2013 Building Positive Relationships\nwith Children \u2013 The dimension of Positive Climate: This week will focus on the\nfirst dimension of Emotional Support \u2013 Positive Climate. You\u2019ll learn about the\nimportance of Positive Climate, see examples of real teachers as they\ndemonstrate effective Positive Climate interactions with their students, and get\na chance to analyze what you\u2019re seeing. There will also be an optional homework\nassignment in which you will videotape your own teaching interactions with\nchildren and then analyze what you see based on what you have learned about\nPositive Climate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek Three \u2013 Providing Individualized Support\nto Young Children \u2013 The dimension of Teacher Sensitivity: This week will focus on the next\ndimension of Emotional Support \u2013 Teacher Sensitivity. You\u2019ll learn about the\nimportance of sensitive interactions with children and what sensitive\ninteractions look like in real classrooms. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to\nanalyze classroom videos based on what you know about Teacher Sensitivity.\nAgain, there will be an optional homework assignment in which you will\nvideotape your own teaching and analyze your interactions looking specifically\nat the dimension of Teacher Sensitivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWeek Four \u2013 Supporting Children\u2019s\nIndependence and Sense of Self \u2013 The dimension of Regard for Child Perspectives: In the final week, you\u2019ll learn about the last Emotional Support dimension \u2013\nRegard for Child Perspectives. You\u2019ll learn how important it is for young\nchildren to have opportunities for their voices and perspectives to be heard,\nas well as how to foster children\u2019s feelings of self-efficacy and positive\nself-concepts through your daily interactions. In addition to opportunities to\nview and analyze classroom interactions based on your knowledge of Regard for\nChild Perspectives, you\u2019ll have an optional homework assignment allowing you to do\nthe same thing with videotape of your own classroom interactions. Finally,\nwe\u2019ll sum up all that you have learned about all of the dimensions of Emotional\nSupport across the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Effective Classroom Interactions: Supporting Young Children\u2019s Development", "price": 0, "instructors": "Bridget Hamre, Grace Funk, Allison Leach and Kathy Neesen", "institution_name": ["University of Virginia"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/earlychildhood", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
