This course explores the use of natural materials and ecological processes in achieving effective and sustainable hydraulic infrastructural designs. You will learn the Building with Nature ecosystem-based design concept and its applications in water and coastal systems. During the course, you will be presented with a range of case studies to deepen your knowledge of ecological and engineering principles.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn from leading Dutch engineers and environmental scientists who see the Building with Nature integrated design approach as fundamental to a new generation of engineers and ecologists.\n\nJoin us in exploring the interface between hydraulic engineering, nature and society.\n\nLICENSE\nThe course materials of this course are Copyright Delft University of Technology and are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "BwN101x: Engineering: Building with Nature", "price": 0, "instructors": "Marcel Stive, Jill Slinger and Building with Nature -  Course Contributors", "institution_name": ["Delft University of Technology"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-building-nature-delftx-bwn101x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
