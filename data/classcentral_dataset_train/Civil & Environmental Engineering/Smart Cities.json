How can smart cities address these challenges and become more resilient? And what role will people play in the design and planning of our smart cities?\n\nThis free online course will help you to navigate your own path through the complex landscape of smart cities. You\u2019ll hear from smart city innovators and entrepreneurs, city leaders, communities and business, connecting with learners from around the world to reflect on issues facing smart cities of different sizes and situations.\n\nYou\u2019ll explore what it\u2019s like to live in a smart city, the role of systems thinking, living labs, open data, crowdsourcing and roadmaps. You\u2019ll debate challenges of privacy, ethics and security, and weigh up the value of leadership, standards and metrics. You\u2019ll learn how to co-create a smart city project where you live.\n\nGet started by capturing an image of what a \u2018smart city\u2019 means to you and share it with your fellow learners in the Smart Cities pre-course Padlet activity. It can be a photo, drawing or digital image.\n\nThe course has been developed as part of MK:Smart, a \u00a316 million collaborative smart city initiative partly funded by a grant from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and led by  The Open University, which will develop innovative solutions to support the economic growth of Milton Keynes.\n\nYour educators are Dr Lorraine Hudson who is developing the MK:Smart citizen education strand and Professor Gerd Kortuem, one of the lead academics of the initiative.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Smart Cities", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gerd Kortuem and Lorraine Hudson", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/smart-cities?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
