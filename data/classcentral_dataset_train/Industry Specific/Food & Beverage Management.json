Given this, it's not difficult to see that the task quickly becomes complex.\n\nThe objective of this course is twofold: first, we will focus on contemporary challenges that managers and entrepreneurs in food and beverage businesses should be able to face; and second, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nThis course is made up of four modules and an introduction, each exploring one dilemma that food and beverage companies face. You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers. These lectures combine an accessible introduction to specific topics integrated with interviews of managers and experts that will give precious insights and examples to the participants.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience with us, we will make a Documentary on the Excellences of the Modena District available for you, which is in a format that we have developed specifically for this course in order to give you the chance to experience first-hand the territory as our on-campus students usually do.\n\nEach module is paired with an evaluated quiz and weekly discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the F&amp;B world, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\n\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy.\n\nBelow the guest speakers of the course:\n\nMasterchef Italia Sky \u2013 Nils Hartmann, Head of Movie Channels at Sky Italia \u2013 www.masterchef.sky.it\nEataly - Paolo Bongiovanni, Marketing Director Italy \u2013 www.eataly.net\nBerlucchi \u2013 Paolo Ziliani, Owner \u2013 www.berlucchi.it\nJoia Restaurant \u2013 Alta Cucina Naturale \u2013 Pietro Leemann, Owner and Chef \u2013 www.joia.it\nBranca \u2013 Nicol\u00f2 Branca, Owner \u2013 www.branca.it\nBarilla \u2013 Giuseppe Morici, President Region Europe \u2013 www.barilla.com\nProyecto Expo 2015 Chile \u2013 Guillermo Ariztia, Chile Pavillon Director \u2013 www.expomilan.cl\nWinery Il Cavallante, Milano \u2013 Sergio Morpurgo, Owner\nHeineken \u2013 Floris Cobelens, Marketing Director \u2013 www.heineken.com\nTRDN \u2013 Martin Oetting, Managing Director \u2013 www.trnd.com\nGROM \u2013 Federico Grom, Owner and Founder \u2013 www.grom.it/en\nTetra Pak \u2013 Matthew Hatton, Director Competitor Intelligence \u2013 www.tetrapak.com\nBioHombre \u2013 Matteo Panini, CEO \u2013 www.hombre.it\nAcetaia Maletti \u2013 Carmen &amp; Claudio Maletti\nCantine Riunite &amp; CIV \u2013 Vanni Lusetti, CEO; Francesca Benini, Sales &amp; Marketing Manager; Elena Lottici, Export Manager; Mario Vandi, Brand Manager \u2013 www.riunite.it\nGlemGas \u2013 Marco Guerzoni, Program Product Manager \u2013 www.glemgas.com\nBibendum Catering \u2013 LaFranceschetta58 \u2013 Sabrina Lazzereschi &amp; Marta Pulini, Owners and Founders \u2013 www.bibendumcatering.it , www.franceschetta58.it\n\nDISCLAIMER - Since most of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and the subtitles.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Information about the Course and RulesLearn about the complexities of food and beverage companies, and acquire the competences needed to work in the industry.Products vs. MarketsHow products generate value for the customer and how customers value products and their quality.Tradition vs. InnovationThe role of tradition and innovation along the customer experience in the food and beverage industry.
