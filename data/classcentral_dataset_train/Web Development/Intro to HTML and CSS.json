{"selfpaced": true, "topic_name": ["Web Development"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    HTML and CSS are markup languages and the building blocks that make up the web. This course is called \"Not your Typical Intro\" because it does not follow the usual pattern of other courses and tutorials that you find on the Internet. Usually HTML and CSS are taught with a focus on language syntax. But knowing syntax alone does not enable you to create a webpage from a design. You need to know where to start and how to approach the task, in other words - you need to learn how to think like a front-end developer. \n\nIn this course you will learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. We will teach you how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.\n\nYou will also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.Why Take This Course?Front-end Web Developers must have a fundamental understanding of HTML and CSS, which we\u2019ll accomplish in this course by converting digital design mockups into static web pages. To build the web pages you will use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, the popular Twitter CSS framework.\n\nAfter completing this course you will be able to build a responsive portfolio site with your own CSS framework. You'll also have the functionality in place to add future projects to your portfolio. Most importantly, you will have an understanding of the DOM and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript relate to each other.\n\nThis course's project is part of our Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1 -  From Design to Code\n\nDiligently employ a code/test/refine strategy as you precisely and deliberately translate initial design documents into static web pages. You'll also investigate the Document Object Model (DOM) and its implications for web development.\n\n### Lesson 2 - Your Own Framework\n\nTake pride in creating and personalising your own multi-platform, responsive CSS framework for publishing your professional portfolio projects to the web.\n\n### Lesson 3 - Learning and Using Bootstrap\n\nStrategically investigate an existing professional CSS framework as you use it to build a website using responsive design principles while maintaining code readability.\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-10-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Intro to HTML and CSS", "price": 0, "instructors": "Cameron Pittman", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Programming"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2014-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
