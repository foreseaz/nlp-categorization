Violence is a leading cause of death, disability and health care use worldwide.  Violence is a complex problem and can only be understood and reduced though a multidisciplinary approach.  The course will cover patterns of violence including sexual violence;  biological, psychological, and social causes (e.g., economic deprivation, religious factors); specific types of violence; how media and the arts portray violence; the economic impact of violence; physical and mental consequences; and ways to control and prevent violence in our communities.  We are very fortunate that PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER is participating in our course. He delivers a lecture on the efforts of the Carter Center to end violence around the world, and he engages in a discussion with us about his life and work in human rights.\n\nDo join us for short videos, readings and discussions. And also see our coffee chats, where we (Pamela and Deb) summarize and reflect on each module. And we want to hear from you! Feel free to reach out via Twitter or through the course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Overview of ViolenceWe begin the course by defining violence and discussing why violence can be difficult to identify and measure.
