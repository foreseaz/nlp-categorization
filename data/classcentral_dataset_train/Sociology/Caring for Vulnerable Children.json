In this free online course, we\u2019ll help you explore some of the issues involved in undertaking this task.\n\nUnderstand risk and vulnerability, in theory and practice\n\nWe\u2019ll consider what we mean by risk and vulnerability, as well as how we define good enough parenting. We\u2019ll think about how children grow and develop, and how we can provide them with containment and security via meaningful relationships and attachments. And we\u2019ll look at the particular skills involved in communicating with children and young people.\n\nWe\u2019ll go on to learn about the characteristics that define different methods of practice and how some approaches can help us to resist risk-averse thinking. We\u2019ll consider different possible interventions and how, in Scotland, this is managed within the Children\u2019s Hearing System.\n\nWe\u2019ll conclude by reflecting on the current politics of caring for vulnerable children in a context of budget cuts and increasing child poverty.\n\nDevelop your career in child care or social work\n\nThe knowledge you gain from this course may prompt you to explore or extend a career in child care or social work services. You\u2019ll also consider the role you play in responding to and caring for the children and young people who you encounter in different aspects of your life. We hope to inspire and challenge you to think differently about how we, as a society, care for vulnerable children and the future lives we help them to create.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z", "title": "Caring for Vulnerable Children", "price": 0, "instructors": "Graham McPheat", "institution_name": ["University of Strathclyde"], "commitment": "4 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/vulnerable-children?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
