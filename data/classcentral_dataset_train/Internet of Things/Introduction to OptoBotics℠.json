In this first class in the specialization, students will learn about optical components and how they are used when building robots and drones.   Exciting applications of merging optics and robotics will also be covered, including: Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (ISR), Chemical Detection, Agricultural, Farming &amp; Commercial Fishery Management, Firefighting &amp; Infrared Heat Detection and Extraterrestrial-Based Systems.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Introduction to OptoBotics\u2120The \"what is\" and \"why\" of OptoBotics is reviewed, along with its history and an extreme example - the Mars Rover Curiosity.Optical ComponentsThis week, we will introduce you to a number of different types of optical components. Robotic ComponentsIn this week's lesson, we will go over some of the basic components that are involved in constructing robotic systems and the parameters to be aware of when choosing components. We will briefly cover motors and their control methods, optical sensors, video transmitters, and micro-controllers which are used to control the entire robotic system.Real World OptoBotics\u2120 ApplicationsThis lesson will combine the materials you have learned in the previous three lessons and wrap them together to give you a brief sense of what can be accomplished with these systems in real life. \n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-13T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to OptoBotics\u2120", "price": 0, "instructors": "Donn Silberman", "institution_name": ["University of California, Irvine"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/optobotics", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
