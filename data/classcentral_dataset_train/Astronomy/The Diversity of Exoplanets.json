Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    extrasolarplanets-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.\u00a0Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe and\u00a0that planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted. Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solar\u00a0neighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing,\u00a0and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories,\u00a0as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describe the different approaches to detect exoplanets and\u00a0characterise\u00a0their orbital and physical properties.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 - Introduction: History and context \u00a0Week 2 - Planet detection I: the mass and orbital characterisation of systemsWeek 3 - Planet detection II: the power of transit \u00a0Week 4 - Statistical results I: mass\u2010separation\u2010radius \u00a0Week 5 - Statistical results II: orbital characteristics and architecture of systems \u00a0Week 6 - Observational approach to planetary atmospheres\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Diversity of Exoplanets", "price": 0, "instructors": "St\u00e9phane Udry", "institution_name": ["University of Geneva"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/extrasolarplanets", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
