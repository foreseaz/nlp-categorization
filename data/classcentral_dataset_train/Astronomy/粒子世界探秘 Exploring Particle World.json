The goal of particle physics is to study the elementary particles\nmaking up the world and their interactions. The development of particle physics\nchanged our view of nature greatly in the past century. In this course, we will\nintroduce the history of particle physics, main ideas and the most recent\nresults of this subject. This course is an elective course for those students\nwho might be interested in research in particle physics. It can also be useful\nfor any undergraduate who have taken general physics courses and want to get an\ninsight into the nature deeply.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \u7b2c\u4e00\u5468\n\u7269\u8d28\u4e0e\u53cd\u7269\u8d28\n\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5468\n\u5938\u514b\u548c\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\n\n\u7b2c\u4e09\u5468\n\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\n\n\u7b2c\u56db\u5468\n\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\n\n\u7b2c\u4e94\u5468\n\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e0c\u683c\u65af\u7c92\u5b50\n\n\u7b2c\u516d\u5468\n\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\n\n\u7b2c\u4e03\u5468\n\u7c92\u5b50\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\n\n\u7b2c\u516b\u5468\n\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-03-12T00:00:00Z", "title": "\u7c92\u5b50\u4e16\u754c\u63a2\u79d8 Exploring Particle World", "price": 0, "instructors": "\u5b63 \u5411\u4e1c", "institution_name": ["Shanghai Jiao Tong University"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/sjtujxdepw", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["Chinese"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
