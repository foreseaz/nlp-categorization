The Earth is the only planet with just a single moon. Some moons are bigger than ours; many are much smaller. There are even tiny moons orbiting some of the asteroids. Some have ongoing volcanic eruptions; others are dead, heavily cratered lumps. One has rivers and lakes of liquid methane. Our own Moon has resources that could help open the Solar System for future exploration. A small handful of moons have conditions below their surfaces where primitive life might exist.\n\nSign up to explore the rich diversity of moons, the fundamental processes that have shaped them, and the relationship between the Moon and the Earth. You will be under the guidance of experts from The Open University and elsewhere. The course is rich in high-quality text, images, video, audio and interactive elements.\n\nAll Open University Science MOOCs presented on FutureLearn are produced with the kind support of Dangoor Education.\n\n\n\nRead more about this course on the FutureLearn blog.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Moons", "price": 0, "instructors": "David Rothery", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/moons?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
