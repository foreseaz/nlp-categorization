January 5, 2015 - May 31, 2015\r\nStudents may choose to work at their own pace across all three subject areas, or to select individual content areas. Pretests will determine any learning deficits, which can then be mastered through self-paced learning modules. Not forgetting the importance of the human touch, this course is overseen by a trio of reading, writing, and mathematics professors who will be available to assist and encourage students along their journey to college readiness.The\u00a0reading\u00a0portion of this course covers identifying, distinguishing, analyzing and inferring information from written English.The\u00a0writing\u00a0portion of this course covers proper grammar, syntax and appropriate usage and mechanics of writing in English.The\u00a0math\u00a0portion of this course covers whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, percents, inequalities and algebraic expressions.Student Success TipsThis is not a traditional course, but a self-directed, self-study type of course; therefore in order to gain as much as possible of the knowledge and skills sought after, you need to be organized and manage your time well. There are no required assignments or deadlines for completing any activities (other than the timeframe of the entire course). However this course does include three distinct modules - reading, writing and math - and it is therefore equivalent to three separate short courses. It is up to you to decide which of the three modules' skills you want and/or need to focus mostly on (or all three) and create an appropriate schedule that fits your current personal, professional and family engagements. It is suggested that you devote at least ten hours per week to complete the learning activities required in each module. Make sure that you communicate with the instructor(s) or your classmates via the course email if you have any questions on any course materials or need assistance completing any activities. You can always communicate with the three available instructors leading the three course modules about any details pertaining to each of these three modules.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "College Readiness\u2013 Reading, Writing and Math", "price": 0, "instructors": "David Hennessy, Abraham Biggs and Charlene Koonin", "institution_name": ["Broward College"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/broward/courses/college-readiness-summer-2016", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
