The course helps the students refresh and strengthen their fluency with the mathematical tools and the fundamental topics in Mechanics: Kinematics, Newton\u2019s laws and Laws of Conservation. The last unit of the course contains a comprehensive Final Exam. The students who completed this mini-course will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced course material in the fall.Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses\n\n* Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.\n\nDo I need to buy a textbook?\n\nGenerally, no. Having access to an introductory-level physics textbook would be useful; however, the course will refer you to various free online resources if you need to review a particular concept.\n\nDo I need to know Calculus to take this course?\n\nNo. You will need Calculus for your actual AP Physics C course but not for this course.\n\nWill this course prepare me for the AP Physics C (Mechanics) Exam?\n\nNo. The purpose of the course is to help you achieve success in the AP Physics C (Mechanics) course that you will be taking at your school. We also recommend that you check out edX course\u00a0Advanced Introductory Classical Mechanics\u00a0that covers all the topics of AP Physics C (Mechanics) course and can serve as an excellent supplementary or a standalone course for those interested in preparing for the AP Exam in that discipline.\u00a0\n\nDoes it cost anything to take this course?\n\nNo. The course is completely free. However, if you want to obtain a verified certificate, there is a small fee involved.\n\nWho is the strange-looking guy who seems to be falling off his pedestal in the photo above the course title?\n\nThis monument, found in a small medieval French town of Yvoire on the shore of Lake Geneva, is meant to depict the famous Higgs Boson, discovered at CERN in 2012. No, not Higgs \u2013Higgs Boson. Really. The CERN people all agree that the resemblance is striking.\n\nAP is a trademark registered and/or owned by the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, this product.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-09-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "MechC101x: On-Ramp to AP* Physics C: Mechanics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Boris Korsunsky", "institution_name": ["Weston High School"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/ramp-ap-physics-c-mechanics-weston-high-school-mechc101x-0", "duration": "14 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
