You also need to know what they believe your product or service, and your competitors\u2019, provides. In this course, you\u2019ll examine perceptual maps, which are used to identify how consumers differentiate among products and how they perceive one product relative to another. These maps are valuable for identifying opportunities to introduce and position new products, repositioning existing products, and identifying your true competitors. You will also examine positioning statements, which are the foundation of an overall marketing effort, and learn how to create a positioning statement for your brand.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Use Mapping to Position Your Brand", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sachin Gupta", "institution_name": ["eCornell"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/use-mapping-to-position-your-brand", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2013-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
