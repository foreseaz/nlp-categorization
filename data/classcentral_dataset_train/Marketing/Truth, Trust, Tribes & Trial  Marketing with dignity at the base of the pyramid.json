They transform your chances for making change, and the 4Ts must be incorporated into your operations long before you execute the traditional 4Ps of marketing.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-03-03T00:00:00Z", "title": "Truth, Trust, Tribes & Trial: Marketing with dignity at the base of the pyramid", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["+Acumen"], "commitment": "3-5 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "http://plusacumen.org/courses/marketing-bop/", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
