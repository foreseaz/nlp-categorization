The aim of the\ncourse is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along \"moments-that-matter\" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are\nthus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing\nbusiness strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.You will learn and practice the following skills:\n\n\n\nHow to build brands from a broad organisational perspective\u00a0\nHow to lead brand-led\nculture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a\nlever and not just an outcome)\u00a0\nHow to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and\ngeographies\nHow to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally\nHow to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets.\u00a0\n\n\nWho? This course is designed for a broad audience of marketing\nand non-marketing professionals, in particular human resources and finance but\nextending to all employees who need to understand their critical role in\ndelivering on the brand promise. It is also accessible to students, to complement a more traditional\ncourse on branding. This course is\u00a0NOT\nfor couch potatoes as you will be challenged to do stuff in the real world!\n\nWhy? This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:\n\nHead. Gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than\npracticed in most organisations todayHeart. Be motivated to\nengage in delivering your own brands \u2013 regardless of where you are in your\norganisation \u2013 thereby creating superior value for customers and for your\norganisationHands. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: \u201cI hear and I\nforget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.\u201d\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Module 1 -\u00a0Brand purpose &amp; experience\u00a0Module 2 - Brand design &amp; deliveryModule 3 -\u00a0Brand leadership &amp; alignmentModule 4 -\u00a0Brand practices &amp; engagementModule 5 -\u00a0Brand metrics &amp; returnsThe week before the course officially starts, we'll have a soft launch with a taster video and activity.\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour", "price": 0, "instructors": "Nader Tavassoli", "institution_name": ["University of London International Programmes"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/brand", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
