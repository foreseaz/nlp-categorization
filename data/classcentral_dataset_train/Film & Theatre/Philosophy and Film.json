Film is not merely entertainment, but rather culture condensed into artistic works created to reflect both who we are and what we want to be. The class will consist of video lectures, short readings and lively discussion boards. Expect to enjoy thinkers such as Aristotle, Marx, and Kant; issues such as \u201cWho am I?\u201d \u201cWhat is the good life?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the role of government?\u201d and films such as\u00a0The Hunger Games,\u00a0Inception, and\u00a0District 9. You will become more philosophically, cinematically, and culturally literate after taking this course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Philosophy and Film", "price": 0, "instructors": "William A.
