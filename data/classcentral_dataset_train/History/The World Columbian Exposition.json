The largest World\u2019s Fair to date, the Chicago Fair entertained, amazed, and edified 27 million people, introduced hundreds of new technologies and products, and left us legacies such as the carnival midway, the ferris wheel, the trade show, not to mention Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer and Wrigley Gum. This course will take a tour of all the wonders of the Fair as well as introduce students to many of the available online primary sources.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-11-17T00:00:00Z", "title": "The World Columbian Exposition", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kris A.
