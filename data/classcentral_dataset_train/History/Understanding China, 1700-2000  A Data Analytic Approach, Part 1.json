Current understandings\nof human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or\non non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers\nalternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three\ncenturies. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of\ndiscovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can\ntake any Part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other Part.\n\nPart One focuses on comparative\ninequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions \u2018Who rises to\nthe top?\u2019 and \u2018Who gets what?\u2019. Please note that Part One was\npreviously named \u2018A New History for a New China, 1700-2000: New Data and New\nMethods, Part 1\u2019.\n\nPart Two turns to an arguably even more important question\n\u2018Who are we?\u2019 as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior\n- mortality, marriage, and reproduction \u2013 and their interaction with economic\nconditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are\nfundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically\nbetween China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and\nbecause these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and\nvalues.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Part 1 covers the following subjects:\n\n    Social Structure and Education in Late Imperial China\n    Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China\n    Social Mobility and Wealth Distribution in China\n    Wealth Distribution and Regime Change\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Lee", "institution_name": ["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/newchinahistory1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
