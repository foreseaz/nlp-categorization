But demand for labour meant that the prosperity of working people rose, and towards the end of the century, the introduction of printing transformed access to literacy and books.\n\nEach week, we\u2019ll address a different perspective of this period:\n\n\n  medieval warfare\n  the lives of peasants and farmers\n  food and culture\n  death and commemoration\n  reading and the introduction of printing.\n\n\nThe rediscovery and reinterment of Richard III\n\nWe\u2019ll look at how historians and archaeologists have reconstructed Richard\u2019s road to Bosworth - the battle in which he died - and how one of England\u2019s most famous kings came to be buried in Leicester.\n\nThis will help you understand Richard III\u2019s reinterment, as his remains were taken to Bosworth, through the villages connected with his last battle, and finally laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral in March 2015.\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-05-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "England in the Time of King Richard III", "price": 0, "instructors": "Deirdre O'Sullivan", "institution_name": ["University of Leicester"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/england-of-richard-third?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
