This is a hands-on course that emphasizes interactive examples and practice. In the first four weeks, we will review principles of effective writing, examples of good and bad writing, and tips for making the writing process easier. In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others\u2019 work.\u00a0The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing).Subtitles for\u00a0all video lectures available in: English, Portuguese\u00a0(provided by\u00a0Lemann Foundation).\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 (September 24-30): Introduction; principles of effective writing (cutting unnecessary clutter)Week 2 (October 1-7): Principles of effective writing (verbs)Week 3 (October 8-14): Crafting better sentences and paragraphsWeek 4 (October 15-21): Organization; and streamlining the writing processWeek 5 (October 22-28): The format of an original manuscriptWeek 6 (October 29-Nov. 4): Reviews, commentaries, and opinion pieces; and the publication processWeek 7 (November 5-11): Issues in scientific writing (plagiarism, authorship, ghostwriting, reproducible research) Week 8 (November 12-18): How to do a peer review; and how to communicate with the lay public\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Writing in the Sciences", "price": 0, "instructors": "Kristin Sainani", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "4-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/sciwrite", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2012-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
