A major tool to manipulate and study this data is linear algebra.\u00a0This course is part 1 of a 2-part course. \u00a0In this part, we\u2019ll learn basics of matrix algebra with an emphasis on application. \u00a0This class has a focus on computer graphics while also containing examples in data mining. We\u2019ll learn to make an image transparent, fade from one image to another, and rotate a 3D wireframe model. \u00a0We\u2019ll also mine data; for example, we will find similar movies that one might enjoy seeing. In the topic of sports ranking, we\u2019ll be ready to participate in March Madness and submit our own mathematically generated brackets to compete against millions of others.\u00a0 The lectures are developed to encourage you to explore and create your own ideas either through your own programming but also with online tools developed for the course.\u00a0 Come to this course ready to investigate your own ideas.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-03-30T00:00:00Z", "title": "D003x.1: Applications of Linear Algebra Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Bruce Scates", "institution_name": ["Davidson College"], "commitment": "1 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/applications-linear-algebra-part-1-davidsonx-d003x-1", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2015-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
