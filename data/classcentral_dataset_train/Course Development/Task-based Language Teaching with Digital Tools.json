After an introduction to task-based learning, participants will have the opportunity to evaluate a wealth of Web-based and non Web-based digital tools, design digital tasks, explore authentic assessment tasks, and develop task-based lesson plans and a digital task-based syllabus.\r\n\r\nDue to the collaborative nature of this course, participants will be expected to contribute to the list of digital tools discussed throughout the course. By the end of the course, students will be highly aware of the wide range of digital tools available and will have a deep resource bank of digital-tasks to choose from when developing task-based lessons within their own language courses.\r\n\r\nStudents should be interested in implementing task-based language teaching and digital tools in their language classrooms.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-05-19T00:00:00Z", "title": "Task-based Language Teaching with Digital Tools", "price": 0, "instructors": "Brian Hutchinson", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/task-based-language-teaching-with-digital-tools-1", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
