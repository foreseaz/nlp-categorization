They will refer to digital resources, including e-books, video clips, podcasts, and a supplemental Web site. Students will be asked to reflect on their understanding of each topic in their personal blog every week after they read the assigned chapter, view the relevant video clips, and listen to the podcast.\r\nHardware and software skill builder tutorials will be provided to ensure that students have foundational technology skills in educational settings. The arrangement of the course will meet the needs of students\u2019 different learning styles.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-09-08T00:00:00Z", "title": "Technology Applications in Education", "price": 0, "instructors": "Shuyan Wang", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/courses/technology-applications-in-education", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2014-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
