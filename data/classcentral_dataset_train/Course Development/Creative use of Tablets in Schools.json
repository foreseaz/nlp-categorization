How do I deal with related administrative and technical issues? How can tablets support innovative approaches such as personalized or collaborative learning?\u00a0This course does not only provide\u00a0guidance on these topics\u00a0but also provides a forum for you to\u00a0exchange with your peers\u00a0on these questions.\r\nThe course aims to inspire to use tablets to foster innovative teaching and learning. In\u00a0four modules\u00a0it provides\u00a0a general introduction\u00a0to the use of tablets in schools (Module 1) and then discusses\u00a0how tablets can support new learning approaches such as content creation, collaborative learning, personalized learning and the flipped classroom\u00a0model\u00a0(Modules 2, 3, 4).\r\nWhile the course will be in English, it will be supported by\u00a0national course ambassadors who can provide support in your national language\u00a0throughout the course.\u00a0Please note that unfortunately there is not an ambassador for every EU country available.\u00a0Take a look at their profiles further below to see if there is an ambassador for your country (click on their picture to see their profile).\u00a0\r\nThe course will be\u00a0followed-up with a briefing\u00a0for policy makers from national\u00a0Ministries of Education\u00a0where your views and ideas shared on this course will be presented. The course will therefore be a\u00a0great opportunity to provide feedback to policy makers\u00a0on the kind of support teachers need to successfully integrate tablets in their teaching.\r\nSuccessful completion of the course will be certified using\u00a0digital badges and a digital certificate.\r\nEnroll now\u00a0and help us spread the news by tweeting\u00a0#tabletscourse\u00a0and joining our Facebook group at\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/groups/CreativeClassrooomsLab/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-05-18T00:00:00Z", "title": "Creative use of Tablets in Schools", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["European Schoolnet Academy"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/tablets-in-schools", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2015-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
