Hence in this lecture, which might seem an embarrassment\n(what is a lecture on linear flows doing in a book on \nnonlinear dynamics?), offers a firm stepping stone on the way to\nunderstanding nonlinear flows. Linear charts are the key tool of\ndifferential geometry, general relativity, etc, so we are in good\ncompany.\n      \n\n\n\nStability exponents are invariants of dynamics\t\n      \nWe prove that (1) Floquet multipliers are  the same everywhere\nalong a cycle, and (b) that they are invariant under any smooth\ncoordinate transformation.\n      \n\n\nPinball wizzard\n      \nThe dynamics\nthat we have the best intuitive grasp on\nis the dynamics of billiards.\nFor billiards, discrete time is altogether natural;\na particle moving through a  billiard\nsuffers a sequence of instantaneous kicks,\nand executes simple motion in between.\n      \n\n\nDiscrete symmetries of dynamics\n      \nWhat is a symmetry of laws of motion?\nThe families of symmetry-related full state space cycles\nare replaced by fewer and often much shorter\n\"relative\" cycles, and\nthe notion of a prime periodic orbit\nis replaced by the notion of\na \"relative\" periodic orbit, the shortest segment\nthat tiles the cycle under the action of the group.\n\nDiscrete symmetries: a review of the theory of finite groups\n      \n\n\n\nDiscrete symmetry reduction of dynamics to a fundamental domain\n      \nWhile everyone can visualize the fundamental domain for a 3-disk\nbilliard, the simpler problem - symmetry reduction of 1d dynamics\nthat is equivariant under a reflection, the most common symmetry in\napplications - seems to baffle everyone.

Freedom and its challenges\n      \nWhenever you have a continuous symmetry, you need to cut the orbit\nto pick out one representative for the whole family. For continuous\nspatial symmetries, this is achieved by slicing. And then there is\ndicing.\n      \n\n\nSlice and dice\n      \nSymmetry reduction is the identification of a unique point on a\ngroup orbit as the representative of this equivalence class. Thus,\nif the symmetry is continuous, the interesting dynamics unfolds on\na lower-dimensional `quotiented', or `reduced' state space M/G. In\nthe method of slices the symmetry reduction is achieved by cutting\nthe group orbits with a set of hyperplanes, one for each continuous\ngroup paramete\n\nMoving frames give us a great deal of\nfreedom - we discuss how to choose a frame The most natural of all\nmoving frames: the comoving frame, the frame for space cowboys.\n      \n\n\nQualitative dynamics, for pedestrians\n      \nQualitative properties of\na flow partition the state space in a topologically invariant way.\n      \n\n\nThe spatial ordering of trajectories from the time ordered itineraries\t\n      \nQualitative dynamics: (1) temporal ordering, or itinerary with\nwhich a trajectory visits state space regions and (2) the spatial ordering\nbetween trajectory points, the key to determining the admissibility\nof an orbit with a prescribed itinerary.
