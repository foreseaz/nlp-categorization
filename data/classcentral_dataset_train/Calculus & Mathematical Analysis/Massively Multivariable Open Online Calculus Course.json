Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    m2o2c2-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    M2O2C2 is an invitation to think carefully about how one thing changing\u00a0affects something else. What is the \"derivative\" of a function of many\u00a0variables? How can a curved object be approximated by a flat plane? What\u00a0does the chain rule look like when many things are affecting many other\u00a0things? How do we find an input which maximizes a function of many\u00a0variables?This is a first course in multivariable differential calculus, but along\u00a0the way, we will also introduce a ton of linear algebra. The result is a\u00a0course targeted at a student who has seen a bit of calculus and who is\u00a0willing to learn about linear transformations\u00a0and vectors; such a\u00a0student will have the best possible vantage point from which to explore\u00a0derivatives of functions of many variables.All lectures and written\u00a0instructional materials developed for this course by the Ohio State University are licensed under the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
