Numerical methods are techniques to approximate mathematical procedures (e.g., integrals). Approximations are needed because we either cannot solve the procedure analytically (e.g., the standard normal cumulative distribution function) or because the analytical method is intractable (e.g., solving a set of a thousand simultaneous linear equations for a thousand unknowns).\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nBy end of this course, participants will be able to apply the numerical methods for the following mathematical procedures and topics: differentiation, nonlinear equations, and simultaneous linear equations. Additionally, they will be able to calculate errors and implement their relationship to the accuracy of the numerical solutions\n\n                                    ", "end_date": null, "title": "Introduction to Numerical Methods - Part 1 of 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Autar Kaw", "institution_name": ["University of South Florida"], "commitment": "5 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "http://www.canvas.net/browse/usflorida/courses/numerical-methods", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
