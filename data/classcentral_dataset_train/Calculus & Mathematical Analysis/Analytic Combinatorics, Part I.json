Part I covers generating functions and real asymptotics and then introduces the symbolic method in the context of applications in the analysis of algorithms and basic structures such as permutations, trees, strings, words, and mappings.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Analytic Combinatorics, Part I", "price": 0, "instructors": "Robert Sedgewick", "institution_name": ["Princeton University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/introACpartI", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
