Realization of the power semiconductors in inverters or in converters having bidirectional power flow is explained. Power diodes, power MOSFETs, and IGBTs are explained, along with the origins of their switching times. Equivalent circuit models are refined to include the effects of switching loss. The discontinuous conduction mode is described and analyzed. A number of well-known converter circuit topologies are explored, including those with transformer isolation.\n\nThe homework assignments include a boost converter and an H-bridge inverter used in a grid-interfaced solar inverter system, as well as transformer-isolated forward and flyback converters.\n\nAfter completing this course, you will:\n\u25cf  Understand how to implement the power semiconductor devices in a switching converter\n\u25cf  Understand the origins of the discontinuous conduction mode and be able to solve converters operating in DCM\n\u25cf  Understand the basic dc-dc converter and dc-ac inverter circuits\n\u25cf  Understand how to implement transformer isolation in a dc-dc converter, including the popular forward and flyback converter topologies.\n\nCompletion of the first course Introduction to Power Electronics is the assumed prerequisite for this course.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Ch 4.1: Switch RealizationHow to implement the switches using transistors and diodes, including applications having bidirectional power flow or ac outputsCh 4.2: Power Semiconductor SwitchesBasics of power semiconductor switches, including the origins of switching times and switching loss.
