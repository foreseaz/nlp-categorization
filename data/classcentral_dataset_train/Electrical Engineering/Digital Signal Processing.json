Pick one from below:\n                                                                    dsp-001\n                                                                    dsp-002\n                                                                    dsp-004\n                                                                    dsp-005\n                                                                    dsp-006\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one.

DSP is arguably at the heart of the \u201cdigital revolution\u201d that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability.  In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Broad outline of the topics covered in the class:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: What is signal processing, history of the topic, application examples.Discrete-time (DT) signals: the discrete-time complex exponential, and a computer music synthesis example.Euclid and Hilbert: Signal processing as geometry, vectors spaces, bases, approximations.Fourier Analysis: The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and series (DFS).
