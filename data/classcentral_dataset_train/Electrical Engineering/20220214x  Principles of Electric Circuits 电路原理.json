{"selfpaced": false, "topic_name": ["Electrical Engineering"], "description": "\n\n                    \n                    \n                    Principles of Electric Circuits (20220214x) is one of the kernel courses in the broad EECS subjects. Almost all the required courses in EECS are based on the concepts learned in this course, so it\u2019s the gateway to a qualified EECS engineer.\n\nThe main content of this course contains linear and nonlinear resistive circuits, time domain analysis of the dynamic circuits, and the steady state analysis of the dynamic circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Important concepts, e.g. filters, resonance, quiescent point, etc., cutting-edge elements, e.g. MOSFETs and Op Amps, etc., systematic analyzing tools, e.g. node method and phasor method, etc., and real-world engineering applications, e.g. square wave generator and pulse power supply for railgun, etc., will be discussed in depth.\n\nIn order to facilitate the learning for students with middle school level, we prepare the necessary knowledge for calculus and linear algebra in week 0. With your effort, we can show you the fantastic view of electricity.\n\nFAQs\n\nI don\u2019t speak Chinese, can I take the course?\n\nEven though the instructors are from China, this course provides all English teaching materials, including dubbed videos, quizzes, exercises, discussions, and Wiki terms. According to the questionnaire concerning the quality of these materials in the fall term of 2014, more than 90% students thought them \"very helpful\" or \"helpful.\"\u00a0So technically, it's a English course on electric circuits.\n\nWhat are the textbook and the reference books for this course?\n\nThere is no textbook requirement for this course. The handouts distributed every week are critical. The following books are references ranked in the order of our lecturers\u2019 preference:\n\n\n\tAgarwal and Lang, Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits, Morgan Kaufmann, 2005\n\t\n\t\n\tUlaby and Maharbiz, Circuits, 2009, NTS Press\n\t\n\t\n\tNilsson and Riedel, Electric Circuits 9th, Prentice Hall, 2010\n\t\n\t\n\tAlexander and Sadiku, Fundamentals of Electric Circuits 5th, McGraw-Hill, 2012\n\t\n\t\n\tHayt, Kemmerly, and Durbin, Engineering Circuit Analysis 8th, McGraw-Hill, 2011\n\t\nWhat is the grading breakdown?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020% quizzes\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030% exercises\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a050% final exam\nHow can I get the certificate?\n\nIf your final score is no less than 50.\n\nWhat is the content arrange for the course?\n\nWeek 0 is for the pre-study or review of the knowledge in calculus and linear algebra, which will be used in this course.\n\tWeek 1-7 are on resistive circuit analysis.\n\tWeek 8-10 are on time domain analysis of the dynamic circuits.\n\tWeek 11-14 are on steady state analysis of the dynamic circuits with sinusoidal excitations.\n\tWeek 15 is for self-review and group discussion.\n\tWeek 16 is for exam.\nDoes the course contain the simulation?\n\nSure. The simulation is frequently used in the teaching videos and the exercises. The company National Instruments is so kind as to distribute free licenses for student version of the simulation software Multisim with six weeks of valid period, which is enough for your study. After you register the course, the downloading page will be provided in the course webpage in week 1.\n\nI\u2019ve learned the course of circuits. I\u2019m only interested in some parts of the course. How can you help me?\n\nWe provide a very helpful tool in the syllabus of the course. While listing the concepts, tools, and applications of circuits with the procedure of the course, we provide a Flash embedded in the webpage. You can click the interesting knowledge point. It will automatically generate a learning path accordingly. You are encouraged to learn through this path, which is quick and sufficient.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "20220214x: Principles of Electric Circuits \u7535\u8def\u539f\u7406", "price": 0, "instructors": "Xinjie Yu", "institution_name": ["Tsinghua University"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/principles-electric-circuits-dian-lu-tsinghuax-20220214x-0", "duration": "19 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
