The lectures would try to emphasize the need to understand the key concepts behind these tools for solving various analysis and design problems in microwave engineering. The concepts of microwave measurement both in the traditional microwave bench and network analyzer would be explained and some typical applications of the tools like impedance matching, network analyzer calibration, and directional coupler characterization would be demonstrated. The course would lay the foundation for further exploring the vast area of microwave engineering analysis and design.\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1 : Challenges of microwave design and how Smith Chart can be used to find unknown impedanceWeek 2 : Impedance matching network designWeek 3 : Equivalent voltage and current concept at microwave frequency and s-parametersWeek 4 : Signal flow graph, problem solving with s-parameters and signal flow graphs\r\n\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-04-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Basic Tools of Microwave Engineering", "price": 0, "instructors": "Amitabha Bhattacharya", "institution_name": ["Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Engineering"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc16_ec06", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
