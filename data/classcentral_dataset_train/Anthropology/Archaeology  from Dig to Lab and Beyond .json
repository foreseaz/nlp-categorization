Built around 2,400 BC, Marden is the largest henge in the country and one of Britain\u2019s most important but least understood prehistoric monuments.\n\nEvery object has a tale to tell and we\u2019ll investigate how archaeologists paint a vivid picture of what life was like in Neolithic times through the astounding assortment of discoveries made in this beautiful part of England.\n\nExplore every aspect of archaeology\n\nAn archaeological excavation isn\u2019t just turning up with a trowel to dig. Drawing on case studies from our field school, you\u2019ll find out about every aspect of archaeology, from deciding where to dig to the collection, recording and storage of artefacts.\n\nWe\u2019ll investigate excavation techniques such as topographic surveying and scientific coring. And through distinctive discoveries at the Vale of Pewsey, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what you can do with an artefact once you\u2019ve found it.\n\nLearn how archaeology can study the dead\n\nOne of the most intriguing and eye-opening finds of all is a burial site or grave, which provides fascinating insights into the past. In Week 2, we\u2019ll examine the archaeological methods employed in the study of the dead. What can skeletal remains tell us about where someone lived, their occupation and their health?\n\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-07-04T00:00:00Z", "title": "Archaeology: from Dig to Lab and Beyond ", "price": 0, "instructors": "Duncan Garrow", "institution_name": ["University of Reading"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Social Sciences"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/archaeology?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "2 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
