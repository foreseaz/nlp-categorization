The electronic structure and chemical bonding of materials is related to applications and engineering systems throughout the course. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over thirty five years and is one of the largest classes at MIT. The class will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g. batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g. photonic and biomedical devices). For the Summer 2014 class, edX registration and course materials are free.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2014-08-25T00:00:00Z", "title": "3.091x: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Cima", "institution_name": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-3-091x-introduction-solid-state-1751", "duration": "15 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2014-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
