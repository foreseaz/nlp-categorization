If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    One of psychology\u2019s defining issues\nconcerns the origins of individual differences in behavior: Why are some people\noutgoing and cheerful while others are withdrawn and forlorn? Why do some struggle\nacademically while others excel at school despite minimal study? Why do some\nsuffer the ravages of a psychotic illness like schizophrenia while others enjoy\na life free of mental illness? At the core to answering these questions is the\nages-old \"nature-nurture\" debate: Are the behavioral differences\namong us due predominantly to inborn natural differences or the cumulative\nimpact of our experiences? The nature-nurture debate generated much controversy\nand acrimony within psychology, although today most are willing to retire the\ndebate and declare both sides victorious.\n\nThis course provides an introduction\nto behavioral genetics, the field within psychology that demonstrated that\nNature and Nurture both play a fundamental role in the development of\npsychological traits. We will explore how early behavioral genetic research\nradically changed how psychologists conceptualized human behavior and how the\nmapping of the human genome is fundamentally altering current research\napproaches to a wide range of behavioral characteristics. The course will cover\nthe traditional behavioral genetic methodologies of twin and adoption studies\nas well as modern approaches based on molecular genetic techniques.\n\nUpon completion of the course,\nstudents should have a basic understanding of\n\nhow behavioral genetic research has changed\n     psychology\u2019s view of human behavior; the strengths and limitations of traditional behavioral\n     genetic methodologies such as twin and adoption studies; the behavioral genetic approach to psychiatric\n     phenotypes (to be illustrated by schizophrenia) and psychological\n     phenotypes (to be illustrated by intelligence); and the structure and function of the human genome and the\n     prospects for identifying the specific genetic variants underlying\n     individual differences in behavior. \n\nWhat\nis New in Session 2?\n\nThis course was first offered in 2014. The major\nchanges in this second offering of the course include\n\nStudents\nhave the option of obtaining a Statement of Accomplishment with DistinctionEight of\nthe lecture modules have been re-recorded. Usually this was to allow us to\nincorporate recent research findings into the lecture; in a few cases the\nlectures were somewhat restructured. The re-recorded lectures are identified in\nthe weekly welcome message.There are\neight new supplementary lectures, one for each weekly unit. These supplementary\nlectures allow us to cover more advanced topics (e.g., epigenetic inheritance,\nrace, ancestry and genetics, genetic prediction.) The supplementary lectures\nare not covered in the weekly quizzes and so are not required for students\nseeking the typical Statement of Accomplishment. The supplementary lectures are,\nhowever, required for those seeking to obtain a Statement of Accomplishment\nwith Distinction.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Unit #1: Introduction and Overview \n\nTopics covered:\n\nThe nature-nurture debate and the\nfounding of behavioral genetics; the eugenics movement; what is behavioral\ngenetics?; the \"John/Joan\" case: when the blank slate model failed;\nPhenylketonuria: every geneticist\u2019s favorite disorder. \u00a0Supplemental: Huntington disease.\u00a0 \n\nUnit #2: How Twins Saved Psychology \n\nTopics covered:\n\nTwins: a natural experiment;\nassessing twin similarity; what twin studies have revealed about the origins of\nbehavior; are twin studies of behavior really valid?; adoption studies: not by\ntwins alone; Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MISTRA).
