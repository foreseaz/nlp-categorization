You\u2019ll be encouraged to consider the complex interplay between individual approaches to practice and client-led work.\n\nExplore the relationship between still and moving image photography\n\nWe\u2019ll then explore the relationship between still and moving image in commercial photography, looking at how you can embrace emerging media and potential markets for your work.\n\nWe\u2019ll examine the need for a coherent and consistent visual approach across both disciplines; the differences between narrative filmmaking and moving image photography; and the use of video, CGI, animation, illustration and mobile devices. We\u2019ll also consider sound, as well as image, and the technicalities of using a camera to record.\n\nLearn with expert academics and practising commercial photographers\n\nBased on elements of the Photography courses at Norwich University of the Arts, the course will enable you to learn with expert academics, as well as leading commercial photographers, including Andy Earl and Tim Flach.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Commercial Photography: Still and Moving Image", "price": 0, "instructors": "James Smith", "institution_name": ["Norwich University of the Arts"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/commercial-photography?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
