This course will engage the major issues of twentieth-century aesthetic practice,\u00a0from Freud\u2019s description of the unconscious and the play of dreams as fertile source material for the artist, to the explosive rise of pop art and the dizzying information age that has profoundly shaped contemporary practice.\u00a0To closely study modern and postmodern art is to learn how to look at the world, to take notice of form, color, and image, and to respond to the richness of visual and material culture that is all around us.\u00a0\n\nThis course will not only provide a canonical repertoire of great works of historic art, as well as the context for understanding them, but through the unfolding of such a narrative, these lectures will allow new ways of observing one\u2019s own contemporary world and reimagining its value.\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Session 1:\u00a0The Rallying Cry Of The Avant-Garde: Romanticism, Realism, And Impressionism\u00a0\r\nSession 2:\u00a0\u201cPrimitivism\u201d And The Emotional Power Of Form: Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, And The Expressionists\u00a0\r\nSession 3:\u00a0Painted Blueprints Of Utopia: Kandinsky, Mondrian, And Malevich\u00a0\r\nSession 4:\u00a0Dada And Surrealism: Courting The Irrational With Chance, Dreams, And Play\u00a0\r\nSession 5:\u00a0The Last Gasp Of Modernism \u2013 The Heroics Of The New York School\u00a0\r\nSession 6:\u00a0Pop And Its Legacy/Minimalism And Its Renewal\u00a0\r\nSession 7:\u00a0Critiquing The Institutions Of Art: Earthworks, Body, Conceptual Art\u00a0\r\nSession 8:\u00a0The Cacophony Of Postmodernism In The Information Age\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Touring Modernism:  From the French avant-garde to American Pop and Beyond", "price": 0, "instructors": "Lisa Wainwright", "institution_name": ["School of the Art Institute of Chicago"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Art & Design"], "course_url": "https://www.kadenze.com/courses/touring-modernism-from-the-french-avant-garde-to-american-pop-and-beyond/info", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Kadenze"], "start_date": "2016-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
