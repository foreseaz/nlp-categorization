It looks into ordinary or replicated housing types of different social classes that contributed to the definition of urban identity across borders and time.\n\nEach topic is first introduced through a general overview that examines housing from an urban point of view. Secondly, each topic is illustrated through a typological analysis, aiming for a detailed vision of domestic life at each time.\n\nStudents are encouraged to have an operative view of the course, appreciating how modern and contemporary architecture has reinterpreted and been influenced by different housing models.\n\nImage source: Lyonel Feininger, Beleuchtete H\u00e4userzeile II, 1932 (acc.no.
