ML is a key technology in Big Data, and in many financial, medical, commercial, and scientific applications. It enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. ML has become one of the hottest fields of study today, taken up by undergraduate and graduate students from 15 different majors at Caltech. This course balances theory and practice, and covers the mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects. The lectures\u00a0below\u00a0follow each other in a story-like fashion:\r\n\r\nWhat is learning?\r\nCan a machine learn?\r\nHow to do it?\r\nHow to do it well?\r\nTake-home lessons.\r\n\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        \u00a0\r\n\r\nLecture 1:\u00a0The Learning Problem\r\nLecture 2:\u00a0Is Learning Feasible?\r\nLecture 3:\u00a0The Linear Model I\r\nLecture 4:\u00a0Error and Noise\r\nLecture 5:\u00a0Training versus Testing\r\nLecture 6:\u00a0Theory of Generalization\r\nLecture 7:\u00a0The VC Dimension\r\nLecture 8:\u00a0Bias-Variance Tradeoff\r\nLecture 9:\u00a0The Linear Model II\r\nLecture 10:\u00a0Neural Networks\r\nLecture 11:\u00a0Overfitting\r\nLecture 12:\u00a0Regularization\r\nLecture 13:\u00a0Validation\r\nLecture 14:\u00a0Support Vector Machines\r\nLecture 15:\u00a0Kernel\u00a0Methods\r\nLecture 16:\u00a0Radial Basis Functions\r\nLecture 17:\u00a0Three Learning Principles\r\nLecture 18:\u00a0Epilogue\r\n\r\n\u00a0\n                                    ", "end_date": "2013-06-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Learning from Data (Introductory Machine Learning course)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Yaser Abu-Mostafa", "institution_name": ["California Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html", "duration": "10 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Independent"], "start_date": "2013-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
