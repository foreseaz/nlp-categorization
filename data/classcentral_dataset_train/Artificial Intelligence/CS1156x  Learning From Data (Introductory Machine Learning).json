Machine learning is a key technology in Big Data, and in many financial, medical, commercial, and scientific applications. It enables computational systems to automatically learn how to perform a desired task based on information extracted from the data. Machine learning has become one of the hottest fields of study today and the demand for jobs is only expected to increase. Gaining skills in this field will get you one step closer to becoming a data scientist or quantitative analyst.\n\nThis course balances theory and practice, and covers the mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects. The lectures follow each other in a story-like fashion:\n\nWhat is learning?\n\tCan a machine learn?\n\tHow to do it?\n\tHow to do it well?\n\tTake-home lessons.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-10-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "CS1156x: Learning From Data (Introductory Machine Learning)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Yaser Abu-Mostafa", "institution_name": ["California Institute of Technology"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x", "duration": "54 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
