The situation is similar when it comes to Autonomous Vehicles, which are equipped with robot-like capabilities (sensing, decision and control).Such robots must balance constraints such as safety, efficiency and autonomy, while addressing the novel problems of acceptability and human-robot interaction. Given the high stakes involved, developing these technologies is clearly a major challenge for both the industry and the human society.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1OBJECTIVES, CHALLENGES, STATE OF THE ARTWeek 2BAYES &amp; KALMAN FILTERSWeek 3EXTENDED KALMAN FILTERSWeek 4PERCEPTION &amp; SITUATION AWARENESS &amp; DECISION MAKINGWeek 5BEHAVIOR MODELING AND LEARNING\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-07T00:00:00Z", "title": "Mobile Robots and Autonomous Vehicles", "price": 0, "instructors": "Dizan Vasquez, Agostino Martinelli and Christian Laugier", "institution_name": ["Inria (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation)"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41005S02/session02/about", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["France Universit\u00e9 Numerique"], "start_date": "2016-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
