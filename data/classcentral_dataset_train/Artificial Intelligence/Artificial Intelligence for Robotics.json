This class will teach you basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including: probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking and control, all with a focus on robotics. Extensive programming examples and assignments will apply these methods in the context of building self-driving cars.\n\nThis course is offered as part of the Georgia Tech Masters in Computer Science. The updated course includes a final project, where you must chase a runaway robot that is trying to escape!Why Take This Course?This course will teach you probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking and control, all with a focus on robotics.\n\nAt the end of the course, you will leverage what you learned by solving the problem of a runaway robot that you must chase and hunt down!\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        ### Lesson 1: Localization \n\n-\tLocalization\n-\tTotal Probability\n-\tUniform Distribution\n-\tProbability After Sense\n-\tNormalize Distribution\n-\tPhit and Pmiss\n-\tSum of Probabilities\n-\tSense Function\n-\tExact Motion\n-\tMove Function\n-\tBayes Rule\n-\tTheorem of Total Probability\n\n### Lesson 2: Kalman Filters\n\n-\tGaussian Intro\n-\tVariance Comparison\n-\tMaximize Gaussian\n-\tMeasurement and Motion\n-\tParameter Update\n-\tNew Mean Variance\n-\tGaussian Motion\n-\tKalman Filter Code\n-\tKalman Prediction\n-\tKalman Filter Design\n-\tKalman Matrices\n\n### Lesson 3: Particle Filters\n\n-\tSlate Space\n-\tBelief Modality\n-\tParticle Filters\n-\tUsing Robot Class\n-\tRobot World\n-\tRobot Particles\n\n### Lesson 4: Search\n\n-\tMotion Planning\n-\tCompute Cost\n-\tOptimal Path\n-\tFirst Search Program\n-\tExpansion Grid\n-\tDynamic Programming\n-\tComputing Value\n-\tOptimal Policy\n\n### Lesson 5: PID Control\n\n-\tRobot Motion\n-\tSmoothing Algorithm\n-\tPath Smoothing\n-\tZero Data Weight\n-\tPid Control\n-\tProportional Control\n-\tImplement P Controller\n-\tOscillations\n-\tPd Controller\n-\tSystematic Bias\n-\tPid Implementation\n-\tParameter Optimization\n\n### Lesson 6: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)\n\n-\tLocalization\n-\tPlanning\n-\tSegmented Ste\n-\tFun with Parameters\n-\tSLAM\n-\tGraph SLAM\n-\tImplementing Constraints\n-\tAdding Landmarks\n-\tMatrix Modification\n-\tUntouched Fields\n-\tLandmark Position\n-\tConfident Measurements\n-\tImplementing SLAM\n\n### Runaway Robot Final Project\n                                    ", "end_date": "2012-06-11T00:00:00Z", "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics", "price": 0, "instructors": "Sebastian Thrun", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api", "duration": "8 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Udacity"], "start_date": "2012-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
