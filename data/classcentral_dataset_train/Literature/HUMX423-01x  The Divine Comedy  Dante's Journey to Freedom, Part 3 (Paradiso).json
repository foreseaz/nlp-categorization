Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path,\u00a0la diritta via, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.\n\nDante\u2019s\u00a0Paradiso\u00a0maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person\u2019s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law\u2014the law of relational identity, where \u201call are responsible to all for all.\u201d Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.\n\nAlmost everyone agrees that the poetry of the\u00a0Paradiso\u00a0is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the\u00a0Paradiso\u00a0that unless we have become used to eat the \u201cbread of Angels,\u201d we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the\u00a0Inferno. But to paraphrase Virgil\u2019s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, \u201cWhy be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?\u201d\n\nIn this course, you will be asked to participate in learning\u00a0activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep\u00a0reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits\nas key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical\u00a0approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the\u00a0poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about\u00a0the meaning of the poem at a personal level.\u00a0\u00a0This module is the third of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the\u00a0Vita Nuova and Inferno\u00a0will launch on October 15, 2014, and a module on\u00a0Purgatorio\u00a0will launch in February 2015.
