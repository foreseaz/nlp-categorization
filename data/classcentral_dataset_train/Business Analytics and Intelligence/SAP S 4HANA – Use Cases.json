Gearing your company towards the digital economy means you need to digitize the core of your applications as well. But technology is only one side of the coin when considering the state of digital transformation most industries are in. The other side is the business perspective.\r\nAfter the introduction of \u201cSAP S/4HANA in a Nutshell\u201d and \u201cSAP S/4HANA - Deep Dive\u201d, this course is designed to offer a closer look into business value acceleration driven by the design principles of SAP S/4HANA. The technology-induced implications of the digital economy are huge, though the technology itself is only a catalyst to achieve a fundamentally different business outcome. The selected use cases are designed to emphasize and visualize the value behind this technological shift.\r\nWe will also introduce a framework of value levers to help build your company-specific value proposition for each use case.\r\n\u00a0\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Intro &amp; SAP S/4HANA Use Cases (1)Week 2: SAP S/4HANA Use Cases (2)Week 3: Business Driver &amp; Value Lever FrameworkWeek 4: Final Exam\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-02T00:00:00Z", "title": "SAP S/4HANA \u2013 Use Cases", "price": 0, "instructors": "Bert Schulze and Sven Denecken", "institution_name": [], "commitment": "3-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://open.sap.com/courses/s4h3", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["openSAP"], "start_date": "2015-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
