This poses a challenge for all students, but especially for ELLs who come to our schools with diverse backgrounds \u2014 they are a heterogeneous group. Addressing this challenge for ELLs requires systemic change from the classroom, to the school, to the district. This short course looks closely at the major components of the Blueprint for ELL Success and Part 154-2 in the context of research and New York State schools and districts. It focuses on how to design and teach lessons saturated with communication, and, where needed, develop grammar and vocabulary to support communication.\r\n\u00a0\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "Using Communication-Focused Activities in Designated English as a New Language Lessons (New York)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Elsa Billings and Jeff Zwiers", "institution_name": ["Stanford University"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Humanities"], "course_url": "https://novoed.com/eld-communication-ny", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NovoEd"], "start_date": "2016-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
