You will understand and manage numbers like a scientist. The course will introduce all the main skills you\u2019ll need to understand and communicate scientific numbers, relate them to the real world, and share your discoveries with other learners.\n\nYou may also be interested in joining Basic Science: Understanding Experiments.\n\nAll Open University science courses presented on FutureLearn are produced with the kind support of Dangoor Education.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-12-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Basic Science: Understanding Numbers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Simon Kelley", "institution_name": ["The Open University"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-numbers?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2016-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
