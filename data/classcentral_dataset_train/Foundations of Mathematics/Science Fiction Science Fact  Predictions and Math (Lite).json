Learn how scientists use math to measure changes over time. In this course, you will be exposed to some basic math concepts that will help you understand what you are reading when it comes to the sciences.\r\nFor the cost of an app or a latte, unlock the pro-version of this course. You will get more videos from Super Professor Mike Dennin, more forums to engage with other learners, and more quizzes to test what you have learned. And you have an opportunity to model the zombie apocalypse, applying the math concepts you have learned.\r\nThis course is a part of the Science Fiction/Science Fact series. Each course can be taken independently or sequentially.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Science Fiction/Science Fact: Predictions and Math (Lite)", "price": 0, "instructors": "Michael Dennin", "institution_name": ["University of California, Irvine"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Mathematics"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/ucirvine/courses/sfsf-predictions-math-lite", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-02-09T00:00:00Z"}
