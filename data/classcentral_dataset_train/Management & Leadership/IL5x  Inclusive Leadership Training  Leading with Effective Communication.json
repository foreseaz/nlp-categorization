Through research and real-world examples, you will learn strategies to enhance your communication skills and approach. Topics will include understanding dialogue processes, debunking everyday communication myths, testing assumptions, listening, expressing yourself authentically, and communicating across differences. With short quizzes, compelling case studies, and engaging videos, you will develop knowledge in each section and share your experience with other learners.\n\nThroughout the course, you will create a plan of action to help apply the strategies learned in this course to your work and other parts of your life.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "9999-12-31T23:59:59Z", "title": "IL5x: Inclusive Leadership Training: Leading with Effective Communication", "price": 0, "instructors": "", "institution_name": ["Catalyst"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/inclusive-leadership-training-leading-catalystx-il5x-0", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
