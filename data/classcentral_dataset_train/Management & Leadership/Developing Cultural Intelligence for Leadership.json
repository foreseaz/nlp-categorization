Good leaders need all three to lead effectively.\n\nCQ is the ability to cross divides - whether country, generation, gender, sector or background - and to thrive in multiple cultures. Developing your CQ will enable you to work with people who are different from you, and lead in your organisation, community, business or place of study.\n\nUnderstand and develop Cultural Intelligence\n\nThis free online course will introduce you to the concept of CQ and explore its evolution and relevance for leadership.\n\nThrough a series of activities, exercises and advice from leaders around the world, you will:\n\n\n  build the skills to lead across divides and thrive in multiple cultures;\n  go on a journey to uncover the cultural influences that make you think and act the way you do;\n  see how understanding yourself can help you work with other people;\n  learn skills to recognise what makes others tick and behave the way they do;\n  and embrace diversity and recognise its role in innovative problem solving.\n\n\nIn discussions with other learners from around the world, you\u2019ll grow your network and build relationships which will, in turn, help you develop your CQ.\n\nLearn with Common Purpose - experts in CQ\n\nCommon Purpose has been running leadership development programmes for over 25 years.
