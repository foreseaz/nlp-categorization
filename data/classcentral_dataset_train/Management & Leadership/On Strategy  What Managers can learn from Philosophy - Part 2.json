Pick one from below:\n                                                                    businessandphilo2-001\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one. If the script fails, pick the one above that and try again. Not all of these class names are guranteed to work.\n\n\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                    \n                    This\n entire MOOC is based on one of my strongest beliefs: philosophy is the \nbest tool to help managers in areas where no numbers are available. \nAfter all a strategic vision is an \"idea\", it is translated into a \"concept\", a business model is a \u2026 \"model\" etc. And we need to better \nunderstand what is an idea, what is a concept, what is a model etc. In \nother words we need to better understand how do we think. In the first \nsix lectures we made a surprising journey from the ancient Greek \nphilosophers to the corporate world of today. You probably crossed a set\n of \"new territories\" but honestly, it was the same for me ! Apparently\n this experience has no end in sight! The first six lectures are \nbroadcasted for a second time during this fall and I had the chance to \nrecord three additional lectures last September. Not a surprise: \nphilosophy is like a country you want to visit, there are always new \nroads to discover and even new paths to create. It is highly recommended\n to have attended lectures 1-6 to take the most out of this part 2.In\n lecture 7, I examine the deep nature of the changes the world is \ncurrently facing and the associated challenges for us. Lecture 8 focus \non one of them: the impact of technology on the way we think. In the \nlast lecture I suggest some tips that might help you to become a better \nmanager, in other words to become a corporate philosopher.Evaluations\n will be similar to the ones you had so far: open questions that request\n some research. At the end of lecture 9, I will again ask you to submit a short paper about a famous quote of a great philosopher. Moreover, we will organize a Google Hangout during lecture 8.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Lecture 7: The Essence of Change7.1 The end of...7.2 You need a fixed point7.3 Philosophy as a fixed point7.4 Two first challenges7.5 Another center of gravity7.6 The four causes of Aristotle7.7 'A thus B' or 'A and B'Lecture 8: Is technology making us stupid?8.1 Four types of tools8.2 The disappointing equation8.3 A third example: Big Data8.4 The end of Science?8.5 Question what is in front of you8.6 Who is the tool of who?Lecture 9: Become a corporate philosopher!9.1 Use the right words9.2 Use criteria9.3 Beware the question9.4 Use creativity techniques9.5 Think visual9.6 Never stop thinking9.7 Embrace humor\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-03-09T00:00:00Z", "title": "On Strategy: What Managers can learn from Philosophy - Part 2", "price": 0, "instructors": "Luc de Brabandere", "institution_name": ["\u00c9cole Centrale Paris"], "commitment": "2-3 hours", "subject_name": ["Business & Management"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/businessandphilo2", "duration": "3 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-02-16T00:00:00Z"}
