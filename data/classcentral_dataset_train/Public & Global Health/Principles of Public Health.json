The course emphasizes the\necological model that focuses on the linkages and relationships among multiple\nnatural and social determinants affecting health. As a relative concept, the\nhealth of populations is assessed through comparisons of temporal, spatial, and\ndemographic dimensions of disease burden. The goal of public health is to\nunderstand why and how different populations carry different kinds and amounts\nof disease burden, and to use that knowledge for improving health by preventing\ndisease.\u00a0\n\n\n\nStudents in the course will explore successful examples in\npublic health, including how scientific discoveries and regulatory policies\nhave both contributed to mitigate risk factors and improve health outcomes. How\nsocioeconomic and cultural factors modify the effectiveness of risk\nintervention and disease prevention strategies. How individual actions and\ncollective initiatives play important roles in determining the status of\nhealth. In addition, how the various methodological approaches that guide\ndiscoveries in public health have been applied from the local scale to the\nglobal level.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week One: What is Public Health?Week Two: The Role of Data in Public Health Week Three: The Biomedical Basis of Public HealthWeek Four : Do People Choose Their Own Health?Week Five:\u00a0 The Future of Public Health\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Principles of Public Health", "price": 0, "instructors": "Zuzana Bic", "institution_name": ["University of California, Irvine"], "commitment": "6-8 hours", "subject_name": ["Health & Medicine"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/publichealth", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2013-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
