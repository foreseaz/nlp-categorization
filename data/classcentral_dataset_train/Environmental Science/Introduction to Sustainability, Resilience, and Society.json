How does our individual \u2018ecological footprint\u2019 matter among the billions of humans\u2019 footprints on earth? How are we alike and different in our impacts, depending on where we live; and how does civic and governmental attitude impact sustainability and resilience in the future? These questions will be explored on a global, local and personal level in this introductory course. Students will compare and contrast case studies from suburban Seattle to rural, mountainous China and consider their own significant impacts on ecology.\r\nCourse Objectives:\r\n\r\nUtilize both ecological and cultural concepts to understand sustainability in our society while becoming aware of their role as local and global environmental citizens.\r\nAnalyze how science and the political realm interact to shape our views of sustainability\r\nApply critical thinking to evaluate and participate in dialogue that influences our environmental practice\r\nApply newly discovered self-knowledge about personal environmental impact to his or her place in a global community\r\nAnalyze video case study of ecological impacts in China to make inferences about one\u2019s own community\r\n\r\nNOTE: The first five weeks of the course will be led by the instructor, after which enrollees can access all content and self-direct their learning through the course.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Introduction to Sustainability, Resilience, and Society", "price": 0, "instructors": "Stevan Harrell, PhD", "institution_name": ["University of Washington"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/uwashington/courses/introduction-to-sustainability-resilience-and-society-1", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
