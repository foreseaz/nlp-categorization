It is wrong when\nit tends otherwise.\nAldo LeopoldA Sand County Almanac,1949\n\nHunting has been a core conservation management tool in the United States since its founding. Indeed, \"perceptive hunters\" believe hunting should contribute to conservation rather than hinder it.\u00a0As conservation science has improved, so have calls\u00a0for understanding the role of game species in ecosystems, as well as in regional politics and economics. Deer, pheasant and elk are cultural icons because of their value to hunters, and are also a source of persistent controversy because of their role in complex ecological and economic systems.Aldo Leopold, author of A Sand County Almanac, accepted a chair in game management at\nthe University of Wisconsin and published a textbook in 1933 marking the\nemergence of wildlife conservation as a professional discipline. The scientific\nand ethical foundations laid down by Leopold fostered the emergence of a unique\nmodel for wildlife conservation in North America.\n\nThis course will provide students with an understanding of the historical legacy of wildlife management and recreational\nhunting as a part of conservation, the role of wildlife in ecosystems, the\nimportance of ethics in guiding management decisions and hunter choices, and\nthe politics and economics of controversies surrounding game and non-game\nmanagement, hunting, and conservation.\u00a0We will also look at the emerging face of hunting today, and contemporary models of conservation.\u00a0The content draws on the expertise and\nexperience of scholars, researchers, managers, and citizens in the overlapping\nspheres of applied ecology, policy, environmental and natural resource\nmanagement.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-02-23T00:00:00Z", "title": "The Land Ethic Reclaimed: Perceptive Hunting, Aldo Leopold, and Conservation", "price": 0, "instructors": "Janet Silbernagel, Paul Robbins and Tim Van Deelen", "institution_name": ["University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/perceptivehunting", "duration": "4 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2015-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
