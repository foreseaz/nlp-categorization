These include coal, methane, petroleum, uranium, biomass, water, wind, geothermal, and sunlight. Knowing how we measure, acquire, and use these resources is critical information because human population and income aspirations are increasing, while access to the means of prosperity\u2014energy dense and affordable resources\u2014is at best uneven. This course will provide the tools and information you need to better understand the energy resources we currently use and empower you to pursue energy resources for the future.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-09-21T00:00:00Z", "title": "Fundamentals of Energy Resources", "price": 0, "instructors": "Theodore Erski", "institution_name": ["McHenry County College"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/mchenrycc/courses/fundamentals-of-energy-resources-1", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
