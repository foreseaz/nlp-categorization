Now, the climate itself is being shaped by civilisation.\n\nThis free online course from the University of Reading will take you on this fascinating journey through time. Over five weeks, we\u2019ll explore how climate shapes the way we live, the food we eat, the water we drink and the cities we live in.\n\nFrom the fundamental science of the atmosphere to the social, economic and political consequences of climate change, our expert archaeologists, scientists, geographers and engineers will guide you.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with an overview of the climatic system, how it\u2019s changed over time and how it\u2019s predicted to change in future. Then, we\u2019ll focus on the impact of climate change on our lives. Finally, we\u2019ll take a look at policy - why it\u2019s needed, what\u2019s been done and what\u2019s next.\n\nTogether, we\u2019ll find out what climate change means for you and the part we play in the climate of the future. Looking back, we\u2019ll see examples of inspiring innovation and resilience, and ask: can our ingenuity see us through the challenges that lie ahead?\n\nYou can find out more in Maria Noguer\u2019s post for the FutureLearn blog: \u201c2015: a pivotal year for creating a resilient society\u201d.\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-12-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "Our Changing Climate: Past, Present and Future", "price": 0, "instructors": "Maria Noguer", "institution_name": ["University of Reading"], "commitment": "3 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/our-changing-climate?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed", "duration": "5 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["FutureLearn"], "start_date": "2015-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
