It is part of our human nature to think about equality, and consider fairness as something that we do naturally.\n\nHowever, when you start to consider transaction costs and the problems of aggregating social preferences, you soon realise that, in practical terms, equality is hard to achieve. Equality in aggregating social preferences leads to perverse or impossible outcomes. Moreover, if there is equality of decision making for everybody, then the transaction costs are very high.\n\nIntrigued?
