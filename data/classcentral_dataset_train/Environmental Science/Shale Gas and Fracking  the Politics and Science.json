Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.\n\nDuring this four-week course, we\u2019ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We\u2019ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or \u2018fracking\u2019. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.\n\nWe then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a \u2018bridge\u2019 to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?\n\nFinally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?\n\nAt the end of the course you will have improved you understanding of the costs and benefits of shale gas, and you will have made your contribution to the public debate on this important topic.\n\nKeep up to date with announcements and discussions by following the course on Twitter @ShaleGas_MOOC.
