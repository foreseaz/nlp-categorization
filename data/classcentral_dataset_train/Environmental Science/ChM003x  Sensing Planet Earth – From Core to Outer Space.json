Do we know enough about our planet? What do we need to know more about, and how can we be sure that global change is really taking place?\n\nThis course aims at answering these questions \u2013 and many more.\n\nIn this energy and earth science course we will take you on a journey through different fields of Earth sciences, including the solid Earth, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. Our experts will give you first-hand insights why, where, and how measurement techniques are applied and they will explain to you how sensors in space, on aircraft, and on the ground work.\n\nYou will be given insights on how to use data from various sensors in order to improve your understanding of our living planet. Simple experiments will show you how easy it is to sense Earth\u2019s environment by yourself, and world-renowned experts will explain why it is so important that we study our planet.\n\nJoin us and let\u2019s sense planet Earth together!\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-03-14T00:00:00Z", "title": "ChM003x: Sensing Planet Earth \u2013 From Core to Outer Space", "price": 0, "instructors": "Thomas Hobiger, Donal Murtagh and Maciej Soja", "institution_name": ["Chalmers University of Technology"], "commitment": "6 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/sensing-planet-earth-core-outer-space-chalmersx-chm003x", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
