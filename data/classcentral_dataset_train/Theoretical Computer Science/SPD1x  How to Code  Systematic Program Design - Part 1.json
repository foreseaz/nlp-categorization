This practical approach will help you channel your creativity so that you can program well in any language.\n\nSPD1 presents the core design method with a focus on simple data. You will learn techniques that help you develop your program requirements; how to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later; and how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive program. The final project is an interactive game.\n\nThis course is part of the How to Code - Systematic Program Design XSeries Program:\u00a0\n\nHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 2\n\tHow to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 3\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2017-05-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "SPD1x: How to Code: Systematic Program Design - Part 1", "price": 0, "instructors": "Gregor Kiczales", "institution_name": ["The University of British Columbia"], "commitment": "8-12 hours", "subject_name": ["Computer Science"], "course_url": "https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-systematic-program-design-part-ubcx-spd1x", "duration": "61 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["edX"], "start_date": "2016-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
