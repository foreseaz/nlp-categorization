Interviews at tech companies start with questions that probe for good algorithm thinking.\n\nIn this computer science course, you will learn how to think about algorithms and create them using sorting techniques such as quick sort and merge sort, and searching algorithms, median finding, and order statistics.\n\nThe course progresses with Numerical, String, and Geometric algorithms like Polynomial Multiplication, Matrix Operations, GCD, Pattern Matching, Subsequences, Sweep, and Convex Hull. It concludes with graph algorithms like shortest path and spanning tree.\n\nTopics covered:\n\nSorting and Searching\n\tNumerical Algorithms\n\tString Algorithms\n\tGeometric Algorithms\n\tGraph Algorithms\nThis course is part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science XSeries Program:\u00a0\n\nProgramming Basics\n\tObject-Oriented Programming\n\tFoundations of Data Structures\n\tImplementation of Data Structures\n\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2016-11-15T00:00:00Z", "title": "CS213.3x: Algorithms", "price": 0, "instructors": "Deepak B.
