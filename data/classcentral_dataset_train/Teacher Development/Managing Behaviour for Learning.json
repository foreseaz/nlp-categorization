This free, online course has been developed by the National Science Learning Centre (United Kingdom) as part of their suite of high impact professional development for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Paul Dix, a leading voice in behaviour management in the UK and internationally, will help you learn how to positively influence the behaviour of your students through small shifts in your own behaviour. Other areas covered in this course include how to develop the habits of effective behaviour managers; mechanisms for communicating success with students, parents and colleagues; how to use group rewards to change behaviour; and how to manage difficult confrontations. Participants will develop a good understanding of how to be proactive about encouraging good behaviour in your classroom and reactive in responding calmly to poor behaviour.\r\nThe course is for teachers of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects, focusing mainly on the context of UK schools and colleges. It aims to help them learn how to maintain discipline when dealing with unruly students. Although the course draws from examples experienced in the UK, the material covered is relevant to an international audience.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Managing Behaviour for Learning", "price": 0, "instructors": "Paul Dix", "institution_name": ["National Science Learning Centre"], "commitment": "", "subject_name": ["Education & Teaching"], "course_url": "https://www.canvas.net/browse/nationalscilc/courses/managing-behaviour-3", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Canvas.net"], "start_date": "2015-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
