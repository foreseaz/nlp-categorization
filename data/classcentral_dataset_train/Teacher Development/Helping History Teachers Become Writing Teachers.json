Unfortunately, many history/social studies teachers have not had significant instruction and/or practice in historical writing. Worse, very few teacher professional development seminars focus on this topic. This course will help social studies teachers: (1) identify the characteristics of high quality writing, (2) improve argumentative writing, (3) improve informative or explanatory writing, (4) improve narrative writing, (5) conduct rubric validation, and (6) incorporate peer review and revision memos.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Helping History Teachers Become Writing Teachers", "price": 0, "instructors": "Scott M.
