The past two\ndecades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals\n(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the\nforefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many\nas eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring\nto the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings \u2013 to\nadvance the learning of all students in the class.\nOur overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge\n    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students\n    to learn challenging subject matter \u2013 a practice we call \u201cleveraging student\n    thinking\u201d.\nCourse content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various\n    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable\n    to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design\n    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational\n    tools to:\n\n    elicit student thinking,\n    attend to significant features of that thinking,\n    interpret students\u2019 ideas within a developmental framework, and\n    bridge from students\u2019 current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.\n\nThese ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.\n    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging\n    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental\n    and managerial \u201cpressure points\u201d that challenge teachers\u2019 ability to capitalize\n    on student thinking in constructive ways.Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms,\u00a0be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)\u00a0 The goal is to\u00a0work on the work of teaching\u00a0while\u00a0teaching.In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course. \u00a0At\u00a0key\u00a0points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback.\u00a0Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to\u00a0plan to work through\u00a0this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers\u00a0who\u00a0do not have a team at the beginning of the course\u00a0will be able to create a team through\u00a0online forums at the beginning of the course\u00a0and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        This course justifies and unpacks a teaching practice we call leveraging student thinking. \u00a0This practice (actually a constellation of practices) supports important educational goals including, but not limited to, achievement as outlined in the Common Core State Standards. The elements of leveraging are:\u00a0eliciting student thinking\u00a0attending to significant features of that thinking\u00a0interpreting students' ideas within a developmental frameworkbridging from students' current understandings to more sophisticated understandingsOver the course of four lessons we will explore each element listed above. We will be drawing upon both our own* and others' research,as well as the insights of practicing teachers.\u00a0* We are grateful to the National Science Foundation for their support of the research on which this course is based and the preparation of the materials found here: \u00a0\"Linking Teacher Preparation to Student Learning in Mathematics and Science\", National Science Foundation, Award ID 0554486.\u00a0Lesson 1: Eliciting Student Thinking at the Core\u00a0(available on August 19)Goal:\u00a0Design a better task -- i.e., one that will more effectively get students\u2019 thinking on the table.\u00a0Essential Questions:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What does it mean to leverage student thinking?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why is leveraging student thinking educative?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How can you design tasks to more effectively elicit student thinking and make students' understandings more visible? \u00a0Assignments:\u00a0Design a task to effectively elicit student thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Complete survey.Lesson 2: Anticipating and Interpreting Student Thinking\u00a0(available on August 26)Goal:\u00a0Locate your students' thinking (elicited in assignment #2) within a developmental framework.\u00a0\u00a0Essential Questions:\u00a0What\u2019s the developmental trajectory that links students' current understandings of particular concepts to more sophisticated understandings?\u00a0What does it mean to locate student thinking within a trajectory of development?Assignments:\u00a0\u00a0Sort the student work you collected from least to most sophisticated.
