The course starts by introducing basic neuroanatomy, neurodevelopment and mechanisms of neural communication. Students will gain an understanding of how injury and disease of different types and in different locations can alter a person\u2019s life. Students will then use their understanding of fundamental neuroanatomy and physiology to examine how:\u00a01) we perceive the outside world; 2) we act in the world either volitionally or emotionally; 3) our nervous system allows us to live; and 4) cognition operates to make us the human individuals that we are.\u00a0We will look at the neurobiology of everyday situations such as multitasking (walking and chewing gum) and at the ways in which the nervous system commonly fails us (e.g. motion sickness). Each week, topics that are best described as neuro-philosophical conundrums will be discussed in forums. Beyond emerging from this course with a new appreciation of many neurological conditions, students will come out recognizing the brain in action all day and every day.
