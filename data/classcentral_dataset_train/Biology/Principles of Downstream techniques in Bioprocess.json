The economy of a manufacturing process is determined by the cost effectiveness of these downstream operations. This course discusses these operations and the basic underlying principles with worked out problems. This course will be useful for UG/PG students in biotechnology/chemical engineering as well as practicing bioprocess and chemical engineers.\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "2015-10-26T00:00:00Z", "title": "Principles of Downstream techniques in Bioprocess", "price": 0, "instructors": "Mukesh Doble", "institution_name": ["IIT ( Indian Institute of Technology Madras)"], "commitment": "1-2 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc15_bt03/preview", "duration": "6 weeks", "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["NPTEL"], "start_date": "2015-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
