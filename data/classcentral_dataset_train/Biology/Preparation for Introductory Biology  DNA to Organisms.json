They are required to earn a Distinction certificate.Quizzes are timedAll quizzes and peer assessments have weekly due dates\n\nThis course will\ncover the foundational concepts of cell biology and chemistry:Parts of a cell and its membranePolarity, charge and waterMembrane transport, rearranging the cell and\u00a0\u00a0cell movementBiological macromolecules and their functional chemistryManufacturing and transporting of proteinsMembrane potentials and action potentialsGenes, alleles, mutationsCellular respiration, photosynthesis as redox reactionsThis course is part of a research project to study student learning at UCI.
