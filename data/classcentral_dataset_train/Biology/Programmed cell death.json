Over  400 courses that are part\n                                of the old stack will be no longer be available.

Pick one from below:\n                                                                    pcd-001\n                                                                    pcd-002\n                                \n                                \n                                If more than one class name below, pick the last one.

Rather than just telling you\nabout the molecular machinery of apoptosis and how it works to kill cells, I\nwill walk you through and discuss with you the critical experiments that led to\nthe discovery of the key components of this molecular machinery and the\nmechanisms through which they function.\u00a0I will also\ndiscuss how apoptosis research can help to develop novel\u00a0therapeutics\nand consider the questions that remain open in\nthe field.The course\nwill cover the following topics:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIntroduction\nto programmed cell death and apoptosis\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe\nBCL-2 family of proteins\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nApaf\nproteins\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCaspases\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMechanisms\nthat regulate apoptosis\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNon-apoptotic\nfunctions of components of the central apoptosis machinery\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDiseases\ncaused by deregulated apoptosis\n\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Programmed cell death", "price": 0, "instructors": "Barbara Conradt", "institution_name": ["Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"], "commitment": "2-4 hours", "subject_name": ["Science"], "course_url": "https://www.coursera.org/course/pcd", "duration": null, "language_name": ["English"], "provider_name": ["Coursera"], "start_date": "2014-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
