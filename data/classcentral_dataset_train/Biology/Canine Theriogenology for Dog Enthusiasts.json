As a dog enthusiast, you want to know what is best for your dog and to understand your veterinarian\u2019s recommendations. This course is intended to give you the background knowledge necessary to help you achieve those goals. Students in this course will learn the basics of anatomy and reproductive physiology necessary to understand reproduction control, and the diagnosis and management of reproductive tract disease in male and female dogs. My goal is to provide you with background information that will help you work with your veterinarian to make the best decisions for your dog.\n\n                                            Syllabus\n                        Week 1: Female dog anatomy / The estrous cycleWeek 2: Breeding management /\u00a0Pregnancy and whelpingWeek 3: Female dog reproductive tract disordersWeek 4: Male dog anatomy / Semen collection and evaluation / Artificial inseminationWeek 5: Male dog reproductive tract disordersWeek 6: Contraception and sterilization of female and male dogs\n                                    ", "end_date": "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "title": "Canine Theriogenology for Dog Enthusiasts", "price": 0, "instructors": "Margaret V.
