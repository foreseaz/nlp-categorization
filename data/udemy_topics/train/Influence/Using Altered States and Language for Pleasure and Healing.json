Change does not happen as quickly as they would hope, if at all.</p><p>Even worse, there is something that they can&#039;t even seem to find which seems to hold their clients back.</p><p>In this course, learn the basics of trance in order to work with clients in these powerful other-than-conscious modality states.</p><p>This is an introductory course which does not explain the nuts and bolts of actually using trance, but which prepares you with a basic understanding of the concepts and ideas between trance and healing.</p><p>I define basic terms and provide a pathway for actually learning and applying the principles in further courses.</p><p>This course is a theoretical introduction.</p>",
