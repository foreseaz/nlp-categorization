The instructor really breaks down how colors influence our daily lives and how we can purposefully incorporate them into our personal and professional lives for positive results. She also shows real examples to help demonstrate her point. I look at so many things differently now. Thank you so much for the wonderful course!\"</em> -Christine Maisel</p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>What if you could be more influential, more productive, communicate better, and have more of a say in how people perceive and treat you just by knowing a few easy-to-remember secrets about color, <strong>all in just under 75 minutes?</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Knowing how colors influence ourselves and others is like knowing a secret handshake that will help tilt life more in your favor day after day. <strong>This course will show you how with practical tips you can begin using immediately, even before you finish all the lessons.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do you know what color to wear on your first date to make their heart go pitter-pat? What about during that sales pitch at work to generate support and funding for your new project or to stand out in a room full of extroverts? What soothing color will get the office troll off your back at work AND your baby to calm down at home so you can get some sleep?  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                        <strong>Emotions are what drive people to think and act in certain ways and using colors strategically will help influence the emotions and actions of others. </strong>Did you know that 85% of shoppers place color as a primary reason  for   why they buy a particular product and that color increases brand   recognition by 80%? <strong>Learn which colors will best help sell your  ideas, your   message, and your products and services.  </strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                Use the color techniques in this course when making  presentations and in your visual communications to ensure that you are  communicating <em>exactly</em> what you want to.<strong> </strong>Have more power to influence your audience to feel and react the way you intend and  get them to take specific actions like support a cause or candidate,  attend an event, make a donation, or buy a product or service.  </p>\n\n<p> This course now includes a <strong>bonus MP3 audio file of all eleven color lectures</strong> you can download and listen to while on the go.<strong></strong> <br></p><p>  \t                                                                                                                                     I'm a tenured Associate Professor of Digital Media and the Program Director of Film &amp; Digital Media at <strong>The American University of Rome </strong>and a practicing award-winning multimedia artist.
