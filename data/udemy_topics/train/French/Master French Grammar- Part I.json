    "description": "<br><p>  \t    Thanks to <strong>a progressive method and simple language</strong>, this course aims <strong>to make easy and stimulating learning French grammar,</strong> often considered difficult.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Each lesson</strong> begins with an example, then <strong>the rules are analyzed step by step</strong> and illustrated by <strong>numerous examples</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Pronunciation and writing remarks</strong> complete the lessons.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    The major grammar points are cut into <strong>smaller sections and autonomous.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t      After each section, <strong>practical exercises</strong> are proposed to permit<strong> the immediate use </strong>of what has been studied.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    This course is the result of <strong>many years' experience of teaching</strong>. The proposed explanations <strong>emphasize the meaning</strong>. Many are the result of <strong>reflections with my students.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>All videos are subtitled in French.</strong>  </p>",
