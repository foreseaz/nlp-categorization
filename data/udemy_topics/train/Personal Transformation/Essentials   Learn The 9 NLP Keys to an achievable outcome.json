When the creators of NLP started modelling successful therapists and other individuals that were known for their ability to hit their goals with apparent ease. They discovered that there are a number of traits disciplines and attitudes that these people adopt in their lives which consistently results in them getting what they set out to achieve.  What they did was to highlight the key aspects of these successful peoples approach and codify it into these 9 keys which can be easily learnt and remembered.</p>",
