This is a science-based approach to building winning  habits to drive you to success.  Easy steps to get you on the right  path.  Definitely worth investing in.\" </em><strong> - Billy Williams (student) </strong> </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Studies have shown that you're <strong>8 out of 10 times more likely to stick to your old habits than new ones</strong>. It's crushing to fail a habit such as shedding some pounds but we're going to show you a breakthrough process that builds habits without requiring 100% motivation, gruelling hard-work OR even lots of time. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The secret is to work with your brain's psychology and to activate the 20 <strong>\"Habit Building Biases\" </strong>which will break bad habits such as procrastination and overeating and build positive ones like consistently publishing online products to escape the 9 to 5 and build a 6-figure online business. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote> <em>\"I love courses that help you think about the human nature and patterns  of behaviour in a fresh manner. This course will have you reflecting  deeply into habits you have and habits you want to lock in. It also has  plenty of actions you can take to reach those goals. Great actionable  information, thanks!\" </em><strong> - Alex Rodriguez (student) </strong> </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guarantee:</strong> By the end of this course you will be able to build or break any habit of your choice and lay the foundation to build a 6-figure business, have a vibrant relationship &amp; healthy lifestyle. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote> <em>\"I enroled in this course to improve my productivity at all levels. The  insights that I got are pretty useful so far! I particularly enjoyed the  5 first habits that give you a rock solid foundation to create a  succesful starting point in any field of your life!
