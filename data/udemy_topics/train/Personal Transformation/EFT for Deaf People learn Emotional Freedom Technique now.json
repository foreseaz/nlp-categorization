    "description": "<p>After many years of working one to one with clients in my therapy room having amazing results with EFT a simple to learn and apply technique, I decided to create EFT protocols that could be used to reduce or eliminate the bad feelings that hold so many people back from the life they deserve.</p>\n\n<p>And now with many successful programs created I thought to myself who else am I not reaching with this simple to learn life changing technique, and I thought perhaps deaf people are being left out with this and many other things in life. So I decided to create an EFT program that deaf people could easily follow and learn how to make positive changes for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not only that I decided to offer this free so that asÂ many deaf or hard of hearing people could learn this amazing technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do I teach you EFT as I do not know sign language, with the power of visual video instructions and subtitles so that to learn EFT all you have to do is follow along with me and read all the instructions on screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
