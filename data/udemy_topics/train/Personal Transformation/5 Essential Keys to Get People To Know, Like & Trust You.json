What is it about how they behave and interact, how they are \"wired\" that drives them to greater success than others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does the level of your intellect (IQ)Â define your business destiny?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author Daniel Goleman argues that our view of human intelligence is far too narrow, and that our emotions play major role in thought, decision making and individual success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-awareness, impulse control, persistence, motivation, empathy and social deftness are all qualities that mark people who excel: whose relationships flourish, who are stars in their business endeavours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course goes through the 5 core principles of emotional intelligences to show you how you can identify, nature and strengthen them in yourself to increase self awareness, motivation, self control and emotion management amongst others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.\" Lao Tzu</p>",
