    "description": "<p>Dr. Kevin Ross Emery started proclaiming ADD/HD as a gift not a curse and as part of the evolutionary process more than 15 years ago. In this course Dr. Kevin will teach those who are or have a loved one negatively impacted with ADD/HD. Dr. Kevin will teach you how to recognize and embrace the gifts of your ADD/HD Identify, how ADD/HD is a diff-ability instead of a disability, shift behaviors that will maximize the gift and minimize the curse of ADD/HD, actualize the positive impacts of ADD/HD on the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels, and be able to avoid pitfalls that inherently appear in the ADD/HD path.</p><p>Dr. Kevin talks about how the ADD/HD impacted person is affected on the physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual (not religious) bodies. With the assistance of handouts, Dr. Kevin teaches solutions to not only minimize the negative impacts, but also maximize the gifts of ADD/HD. </p><p>Finally, Dr. Kevin speaks on navigating a non-ADD/HD world and how to avoid the pitfalls of the ADD/HD path such as anxiety, isolation, fear and depression. He then finishes with how to coexist with comorbidity that comes with being gifted with ADD/HD.</p>",
