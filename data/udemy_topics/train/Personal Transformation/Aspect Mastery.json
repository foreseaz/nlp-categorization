    "description": "<p>The Aspect Mastery program was originally created to combat procrastination. Although it worked extremely well, I quickly discovered that it was useful in helping to overcome many of life's other challenges. Such as:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Following Through</li><li>Losing weight </li><li>Stopping bad habits </li><li>Enhancing good habits</li><li>Improving skills </li><li>Enhancing learning </li><li>Keeping your word </li><li>Advancing your career or getting a job</li><li>Improving your family life </li><li>Enhancing your spirituality</li><li>Finding peace </li><li>And many other areas of life. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This program is a simple 7-step process that you can begin applying to your life immediately. And see results in a short period of time. Once the seven steps have been put in place, you can then utilize the program with only four of the original steps. This is a very valuable life changing tool that you can use to rinse and repeat throughout your life as different needs arise.</p>",
