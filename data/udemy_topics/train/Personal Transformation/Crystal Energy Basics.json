    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\">Crystal Energy Basics </strong>is an introduction to using crystals and stones in your life as energetic support. Historically crystals have been used for centuries, but in the current times, we are learning to use their energy not only for computers, cell phones, and other technologies, but as a spiritual tool for personal growth. As we seek alternative methods of healing and finding calm in our lives, holistic healing methods have long tapped the energies of crystals. We can use them as a meditation tool, for peace and calming, for energizing our water, and most importantly, for our own emotional and spiritual expansion. And it can be in a grounded, practical manner (forget the over the top “woo woo” of waving a magic crystal wand around, it’s not happening here!) that works with your everyday life. Let’s dig in together to bring new awareness to your life.<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This course includes:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">video instruction</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">bonus PDF&#039;s or articles in most lectures (the equivalent of 2 full E-books)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\"></span><span style=\"\">guided meditations</span></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"\">It includes </span><strong style=\"\">90 minutes</strong><span style=\"\"> of instruction and meditations, and is self-paced for you to complete as quickly or as slowly as you need to for your life schedule.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</span><span style=\"\">Crystal Energy Basics is structured simply in short lectures of information, starting with the nuts and bolts of the more technical aspects of using crystals moving up to the energetic properties of a selection of crystals.</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t  Lectures include:<br style=\"\">  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">how to choose them for yourself</li>  \t<li style=\"\">keeping them clear for optimal use</li>  \t<li style=\"\">what different shapes mean</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how to choose crystals</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how to use a pendulum</li>  \t<li style=\"\">sensing crystal energy</li>  \t<li style=\"\">crystal meditations</li>  \t<li style=\"\">properties of 12 crystals and stones</li>  \t<li style=\"\">so much more!</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I will be available to personally answer your questions during this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        If you are seeking new perspective or an alternative method for healing your emotions, changing your life, or simply looking to expand your knowledge, this course will provide insight and ideas on bringing crystal energy into your realm of living.  </p>",
