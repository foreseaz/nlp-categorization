    "description": "<p><strong>Sexual energy is the most powerful energy in your body and it often feels like it guides us. However, if we employ basic breathing and body awareness techniques we can guide our sexual energy instead of it guiding us. </strong><strong>This course will teach you a number of simple techniques that you can start using right away to better control your sexual energy. This will enable you to last as long as you want in bed.</strong></p><p>You can practice these breathing, visualization and movement techniques alone or with a partner. Nothing too complicated, think - yoga and meditation meets sex.</p>  <p>  \t      The techniques taught in the course will support you in developing a more rewarding sex life. You will be able to have heightened awareness for how pleasure operates throughout your mind and body and as a result you will feel it more acutely. You will also develop a deeper sensitivity to your partner's arousal states allowing you to intuitively respond in the moment.  </p><p></p>",
