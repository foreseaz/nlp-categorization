Exercises leading to Seven Gateposts can be practiced as many times and as often as desired. </p><p>Because this practice of focussing, then silencing the mind becomes a habit that brings huge rewards, students are encouraged to view the lessons, follow along with the guidebook and listen to the guided meditations as often as they like.</p><p>The best way to become more comfortable and proficient at Meditation is to<strong><em> get started now with this course.</em></strong></p>",
