These thoughts have a certain momentum to them which is hard to overcome when they have been part of your subconscious mind for so long. Your subconscious limiting beliefs are the # 1 obstacle to creating whatever you desire. No matter how hard you try with your conscious mind, those limiting subconscious beliefs won’t budge.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will help you replace your limiting beliefs, and negative thoughts which you continue to think over and over, with new positive beliefs and thoughts safely and easily.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The key to changing your limiting beliefs is the powerful mind tool called hypnosis and specifically self-hypnosis. Self-hypnosis enables you to connect with your subconscious mind, where you can place new positive, empowering thoughts and beliefs. It has been scientifically proven that self-hypnosis is one of the most effective tools in changing your subconscious limiting beliefs and improving your life. You don’t need to find the cause of your limiting beliefs or work at fixing your negative thinking you just need to replace them with new positive thoughts and beliefs. This is exactly what self-hypnosis and this course can do for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course will make the Law of Attraction work for you rather than against you and change struggle into ease by:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Teaching you how to confidently use self-hypnosis to replace your limiting beliefs and thoughts with positive empowering beliefs and thoughts, thereby changing what you attract into your life. The self-hypnosis technique taught within this course can also be used as a meditation, allowing you to train your mind into a deep meditative state quickly and easily, reducing harmful stress and allowing you to feel more calm and relaxed.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Offering a deeper understanding of how the Law of Attraction works in your life. This will enable you to live the life you choose with more financial freedom, the relationships you seek, and vibrant health.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It will also show you to appreciate your feelings by understanding how important they are in knowing what you will be attracting and how important feeling good is if you wish to become magnetic to your heart’s desire and attain a happiness mindset.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course offers video lectures and audio guided meditation that will take you step-by-step through the process. I’ve taught these strategies for years, and I’ve made it extremely easy to learn to create whatever you want. The course is an introductory course to my more extensive course \"Law of Attraction and Self Hypnosis: Changing Limiting Beliefs\" and if used correctly and practised diligently it does contain everything you need to be able to get the law of attraction to work for you rather than against you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> If you’re ready to acquire this powerful mindset changing tool and take your life to the next level, then it’s time to get started with the Law of Attraction.
