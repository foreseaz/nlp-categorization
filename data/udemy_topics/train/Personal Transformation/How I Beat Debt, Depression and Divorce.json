    "description": "<p>  \t    We all go through hard times in our life. Money problems, loss of a job, the end of a relationship or just long periods of feeling very low. At times like this it can often seem as if we are the only one going through this and others can&#039;t understand how we feel.  </p>  <p>  \t    Nothing in school prepares us for dealing with a life crisis and the medical profession usually see the only way out through medication. We can often feel ashamed about our situation and start to beat ourselves up but the truth is that hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life are going through exactly the same thing right now.  </p>  <p>  \t    Paul Browning went through years of debt, feeling like a failure and dreading opening his mail in case it was another final demand. He battled terrible bouts of depression and then his marriage failed leaving him feeling as if his life had hit rock bottom.  </p>  <p>  \t    The funny thing is that when life seems to be falling apart it can actually be falling right into place. In these lessons Paul shares his powerful story as well as how he managed to climb out of debt and rebuild his self worth and eventually have the relationship he truly deserved.  </p>",
