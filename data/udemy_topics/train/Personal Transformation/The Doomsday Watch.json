    "description": "<p>According to the present Doomsday Clock - created in 1947 by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists - we are now at three minutes to midnight - the end of the world.  We have never come so close to the total extinction of human kind until now.  Our situation is so dire because of the current build-up of nuclear weapons even to failed terrorist states.  Add to that the on-going destruction of our oceans, rivers, streams and even the climate.  </p><p>This experiment - we call 'The Doomsday Watch' is an effort to raise the consciousness of this planet to such a degree that we all begin to do things in concert that will slowly but surely force the hands of the Doomsday Clock backwards until the end of the world and the extinction of our species is no longer a primary concern.  The Doomsday Watch will also be a physical watch that our volunteers can wear to remind themselves daily of our proximity to the final catastrophe and the progress we are making by viewing constantly the only TIME that is important - and that is the TIME that we have left.    </p>",
