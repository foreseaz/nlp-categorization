We also have innate talents and gifts that can be activated and used with our core strengths to meet our spiritual ideal and mission in life. Using this self-study, body-mind-spirit course, you&#039;ll discover your talents, strengths, and even your weaknesses through course content and workbooks, and learn how to work with your dreams and use meditation for insights. The course includes video lessons by long-time researcher and consciousness instructor Dr. Mark Thurston, Jungian instructor Raye Mathis, and life coach Lynn Sparrow Christy, along with a downloadable workbook.</p>",
