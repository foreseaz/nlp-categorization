    "description": "<p>  \t      A lot of people have heard that meditation is good for health so they try meditation. They find teachers and get courses.  </p>  <p>  \t      During meditation, most of them thought meditation is too difficult or useless or meditation is religious action.  </p>  <p>  \t      Most of them can follow instructor&#039;s teaching but don&#039;t know why they do meditation in that specific ways. so they imitate teacher&#039;s movement but don&#039;t get the point.  </p>  <p>  \t      I was one of them when I was a novice.  </p>  <p>  \t      As my meditation experience is deeper, I can realize the essential of eastern meditation could be explained and analysed by the concepts contemporary psychology theory made.  </p>  <p>  \t      I majored in psychology and it&#039;s always interesting for me to translate eastern meditation and eastern philosophy into psychology concept.  </p>  <p>  \t      We, who lived in modern society, can explain eastern meditation in the view of psychology. Eastern meditation could be neither mystical thing nor difficult one.  </p>  <p>  \t      I, in this course, try to explain the essential of eastern meditation in easy psychology theories and help you get the benefits of meditation.  </p>  <p>  \t      I choose 4 factor you get in this course.  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>relax ; reduce stress</li>  \t<li>improve concentration</li>  \t<li>control  bad emotions; anger, depression</li>  \t<li>enrich happiness</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t      I hope that you&#039;ll get better life after this course. and always welcome your feedback and questions.  </p>",
