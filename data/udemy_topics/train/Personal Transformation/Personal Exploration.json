    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>Before there can be Personal Improvement there must first be Personal Awareness!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>In the first of a three part series, we will explore your <strong>values</strong>, <strong>thought patterns</strong> and <strong>emotional patterns</strong> and how they have been shaped, influenced and/or impacted by your lifeâ€™s experiences.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>Once you discover your true values, thought patterns and emotional patterns, you will discover the difference between <strong>rational decisions</strong> and <strong>emotional decisions </strong>as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each.  This is important because we must understand that our lives are made up of a pile of decisions, and without the right knowledge and understanding, the decisions we make can have a negative impact on our lives as well as on the lives of those we care about.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>Lastly, after going through the Personal Exploration process, we will make the difficult skill of Personal Awareness simple by going through a practical, easy to understand chart that explains the <strong>Levels of Awareness</strong>.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>This workshop requires courage to discover more truth about yourself, which will give you the foundation to attain the success you have always dreamed of.</span>  </p>",
