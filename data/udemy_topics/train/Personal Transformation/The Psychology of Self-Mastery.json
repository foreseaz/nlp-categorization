    "description": "<p>Self-Mastery comes through developing certain personal core strengths. If you're like most people, you've tried to develop good habits and attempt to practice certain virtues, but even though you hold these ideals, you haven't been able to actually develop them by yourself. You are looking for a practical way to develop your strengths and a concrete method to achieve self-mastery.</p><p>This course will give you a thorough understanding of how to attain self-mastery through developing virtues/arete (personal core strengths). You will learn the foundations of the psychology of virtue, how these core strengths relate to one another and how they help you become master of yourself, and finally, you will learn some practical steps you can take to develop these core strengths and become master of yourself.</p><p>PLUS - I will be adding bonus videos periodically to answer common questions</p>",
