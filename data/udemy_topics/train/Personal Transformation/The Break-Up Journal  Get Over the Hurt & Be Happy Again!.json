This course is designed to help someone who is going through a break-up, to heal from the hurt, and to discover a little more about who they are as an individual.  By truly doing things to heal from the break-up and from the hurts the relationship caused, this course will help an individual be able to find hope for the future. </p><p style=\"\">Based on the premise of habits taking 21 days to be broken, or to develop, this guided journaling, self-therapy experience focuses the first 21 days on breaking the bad habits related to the relationship that has ended, and the second 21 days to build new habits that are healthy, focused on self-happiness, and which lead to a better you. </p>",
