    "description": "<p>The 2015 Community Forum, “Igenda or WEgenda: How do we define “we”? \nWhat is the place of the “I” in the interaction?” will address a range \nof issues such as: generational differences, the implications of the \nDeafhood movement for interpreters, the power of our words and exploring\n the difference between having access and having to ask for access, our \ninterface with the emerging field of CDI’s and future trends in the Deaf\n and interpreting communities. Moderators, Carol-Lee Aquiline and \nLynnette Taylor will be joined by presenters Wing Butler, Patrick \nGraybill and Marvin Miller to frame the evening’s discussion. Dennis \nCokely, Sarah Hafer and Erica West Oyedele will join in a panel \ndiscussion that follows. Participants will have the opportunity to come \ntogether in small group discussions to respond to the issues raised and \nthen share in an open forum. Our goal is to identify a series of doable \nactions that can be taken individually and collectively. We close the \nevening by celebrating our cultural heritage with poetry from Patrick \nGraybill and David Rivera.<br><br>This was a live-streamed presentation from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf National Convention in New Orleans, 2015.<br></p>",
