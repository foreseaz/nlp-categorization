Join over 8,000 students: learn why habits are the most important part of our lives, and precisely how to shape them to reach your goals. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Struggling to Change? Don't Blame Yourself, Blame Your Strategy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Think about this: many people are <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">still</em> trying to change the same area of their life that they wanted to change <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">years</em> ago.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                       What's the problem? Is it them? Are they unable to change?  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                       No, the problem is that they're using the same failing strategies each time—the strategies that fill most books, blogs, and courses which are <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">supposed</em> to help people change.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                       I've been there. I followed conventional advice and tried to motivate myself into change for 10 years; I tried to \"want it more.\" But it never worked; it never lasted because there are serious flaws with that strategy.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mini Habit Mastery</em> details a strategy so different from the norm that it will cause a paradigm shift in how you think about changing yourself. Since beginning my own mini habits, I'm in the best shape of my life, read 10x more books, and write 4x as many words!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                       I'm not just a passionate teacher of this concept, but its first beneficiary.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>  \t<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I have bought a lot of courses in Udemy, mostly about programming, but this is probably one of the best, if not the best I've bought here. I'm so glad I took a chance. </em><br>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">     - Erick Sandoval (student) </strong>  </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What Will This Course Do For You?</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                    Mini Habit Mastery will help you create good habits and remove bad habits. The strategies within it are based on cutting-edge neuroscience, and are completely different from traditional advice, which is ineffective. If you take this habit change course, you can expect your views on several important life concepts like motivation, willpower, and habit formation to change.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                        Starting and maintaining a mini habit is extremely easy to do; I'll show you exactly why and how this concept works. For such a simple concept, there's a wealth of science and logic to back it up, and we'll explore all of it (in a fun way).  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>  \t<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The varied presentation styles, especially the Science in Action segments, make this course more fun than many. The production quality is high. And the information is solid.</em> <br>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> - Beth Ellen Nash (student)</strong>  </blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mini Habit Mastery Features A Fun, High-Quality Presentation Style</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                    Look at the preview video to see the quality you can expect to find inside. This course features a lot of \"bells and whistles\" to keep you interested in this life-changing strategy. The problem with plain lecturing for an entire course is that it gets monotonous, and it also fails to cater to different learning types. Mini Habit Mastery is dynamic, with nearly a dozen different ways of teaching this important information.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                        This course is based on the acclaimed <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mini Habits</em> book. When <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mini Habits</em> started changing lives, people told their friends about it. That's why <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mini Habits</em> has twice been the #1 best-selling non-fiction Kindle book in the USA; it has been the #1 selling self-help book in the USA, Canada, and South Korea.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote>  \t<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I really enjoyed learning about mini habits and why they are so effective in helping us develop new \"success muscles.\" Little steps lead to bigger changes without trying. The fun teaching style kept me thoroughly engaged and laughing at the skits.

But thankfully, they're quite a bit more entertaining—and often quite funny—when acted out in front of you (starring Actress Laura Avnaim).</li>  \t<li>Real-life demonstrations of important concepts are also brought to life: motivation, willpower, small steps, and more are demonstrated in a visual, tangible way to enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the material. Studies show that increasing the fun factor enhances learning.</li>  \t<li>This is nothing like any other course: other books and courses parrot back content you've heard 1,057 times. Not this one. If you've read my blog, Deep Existence, you know that I have a different approach to many things. For example, did you know that motivation is not needed to form habits? I base my conclusions on thoughtful application of scientific data with some personal experimentation for support.</li>  \t<li>This isn't a course that promises a pipe dream: this is the exact way I changed my life after 10 years of failing with the traditional advice we hear! Read the reviews for the book or the course, or look at the stories at minihabits [dot] com to see hundreds of other people who have done the same.</li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t        Some instructors can throw together a course in a weekend (it seems).
