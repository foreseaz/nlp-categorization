    "description": "<p>Remote Influencing is the flip-side of the Remote Viewing coin. Instead of downloading information from the Universe (Remote Viewing) you'll be uploading information into the quantum wave, where all possibilities exist simultaneously, to snap into one possibility, based upon your informational upload. Or in a word, when reality becomes \"manifest.\" </p><p>But in this case, the Universe becomes manifest in the way you need, rather than some random way. </p><p>In Chaos theory, this is known as the \"butterfly effect.\" Where a little influence upon the Universe can set off a chain reaction to a much greater effect or outcome. You'll learn how to effect the Universe by uploading the controlled information you have, to the reality you need.  </p>",
