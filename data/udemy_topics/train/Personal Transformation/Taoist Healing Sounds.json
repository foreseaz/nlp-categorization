    "description": "<p>Welcome,</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed to educate its students on the Chinese theory of elements. The amount of information that the ancients have cultivated on the matter is quite vast. My role as your teacher is to distill the information in the way that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have provided you with materials to develop an understanding of the basic principals. There are five elements that move in a cyclical pattern. Each element has an associated yin and yang function that correlate to either an organ or bowel respectively. We will cover the colors and seasons while stepping into the emotional realms of each element. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It is through the emotions that the Toaist practices are beneficial. They connect with healing sounds and gestures that transform emotions to positive from negative. I will be your teacher and guide as you follow along with the movement of the course. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you and enjoy!</p>",
