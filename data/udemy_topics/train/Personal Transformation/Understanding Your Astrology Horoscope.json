This course is basic enough for anyone wanting to learn how to read their own horoscope but the intention of this course is for the layperson to understand their own horoscope so that when requesting an astrological reading you will be able to gain more insight into your readings. Not only will you learn how to discover the personality of the chart but how to make predictions using software to make it quick and easy. </p>",
