    "description": "<p>Hypnosis for to visit Past life or lives Guided Hypnosis was created to give you the closest experience to having a private hypnotherapy session here with me. </p><p>Hypnosis Will help If you have ever wondered if you lived before in a past life past life regression hypnosis will take you on a  hypnotic journey or  trip to another life time where you will be visit your past lives and be able to answer lots of questions about that life.<br></p>\n\n<p>Past life regression Hypnosis has been used by people to solve present life issues or just as recreation a fun experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>with Hypnosis and on a past life hypnotic journey you may even discover that you were the opposite sex, if you were rich or poor person, what country you lived in and what era. You may even learn important lessons that will help you understand more about yourself in your present life that will help to improve the life you are living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously we have no way of knowing if what you experience with past life regression hypnosis hypnotic journey is real or what some feel is just a dream or their imagination at work. However in my experience as a hypnotherapist this is in no way like a dream but seems to relate to our personalities and  for most that they are the opposite in this life experience to the past life experience and very like karma so this would make sense as your life experiences are supposed to be spiritual lessons because it is said we are spiritual beings having a human experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another explanation is that your subconscious mind will take the opportunity of you using past life regression hypnosis to take you on a symbolic journey and offer you information in the form of a life experience to make positive changes in your present life.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Hypnosis for to visit Past life or lives Guided Hypnosis course</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">will teach you </strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>1.
