    "description": "<p> This section is called Silver Bullet and it is the sixth of ten sections. This section is about getting what you want NOW. Depending on the level of work you&#039;ve done, and how much you&#039;ve cleared space within yourself, will directly influence how quickly you&#039;ll be able to create what you want in your life. So, if you&#039;re not having the experiences that you want, then go back to one of the previous exercises and see where you might still be blocked. In the Science track we talk about Heisenberg&#039;s uncertainty theory and this relates to the Law of Attraction. In the Psychology track, we meet our younger version of ourselves that need to be seen, heard, told that they matter and that they are loved. And in the Spirituality track, we teach you a very simple technique based on quantum physics that quickly discreate the currently reality you&#039;re experiencing and create the reality you do want. Each section has its own exercise. </p>",
