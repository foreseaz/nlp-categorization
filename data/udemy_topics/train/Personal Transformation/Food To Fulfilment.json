    "description": "<p>Food To Fulfilment is about challenging the belief that our diet is the fountain of youth. Is it possible that there are other \"ingredients\" in this recipe called \"life\" that are more important? If so, what are they, and what order do they go in? Is money more important than job satisfaction? If eating well more important than exercising? Is staying together in a relationship more important than having a great one? If you are ready to raise your standards and integrate all eight areas of your life into one exceptional life, then I believe you'll love this course. </p>\n\n<p>Each lecture is delivered via video, with three worksheets accompanying to help you complete the course.  </p>",
