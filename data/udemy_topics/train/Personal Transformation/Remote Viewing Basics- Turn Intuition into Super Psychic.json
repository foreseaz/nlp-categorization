We’ll take your natural intuition that society has told you to ignore and give you confidence through positive response based affirmation. Thereby imprinting verifiable intuitive data on the mind, the same way muscle memory is created in Martial Arts, sports or Ballet.  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t    You’ll also come to understand that “Thinking” and “Knowing” are truly “counter-intuitive.”  \t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    The only known quantum computer in the Universe is the human brain. It receives over 20 million bits of information every single second, yet only processes 15 thousand bits per second. We spend the vast majority of waking state editing out that information. It’s why people are so very tired at the end of the day, even working a desk job. The level of concentration used, just to block the massive amount of data streaming into the brain, is hard work.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    What is all that other information?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Everything you’ve ever wanted to know about the past, present or future. The Universe is a gossip that wants to tell you anything you want to know, you just have to know how to listen and ask the right question. Just like doing a search on Google, ask one way and get over a million different answers, ask the same question a different way and *poof* what you want to know comes up.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    However, in this case, you and your brain are Google.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"\">In this course you’ll learn how to know anything about a person, place, thing or event anywhere in space/time.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"\">Here you will discover how to take your natural intuition and “turn it up to 11” through the scientifically proven skill.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"\">Commit a weekend to train your brain, like others train for the Ironman race, and your mind will start to work for you in ways you never realized were possible.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"\">Downloads provide you with all the material you&#039;ll need to print out.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"\">Bring a BLACK pen and your intuition.</li>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>",
