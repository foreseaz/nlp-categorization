We wonder how to change or if change is even possible. Yes it is! </p><p>And any development you acquire in the area of self-control will benefit your entire life; how you work, speak, promise, and respond. </p><p>The four practices work! The question is, will you work them? If so, you will be launched into a new orbit of personal relationships and productivity.</p>",
