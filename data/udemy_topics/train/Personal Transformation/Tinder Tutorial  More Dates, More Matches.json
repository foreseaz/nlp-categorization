    "description": "<p>A few years back, we were the \"nice guys\" that always finished last. Whether through online dating or face-to-face interaction, we were often met with unresponsive chats or conversations that seemed to die very quickly. It was unfortunate, but it also gave us a lot of room to grow and fine-tune our techniques. </p><p>The truth is, there are a lot of great people out there who could easily date their desired matches, but they just don't understand the techniques to get the fire started. It's like seeing an interviewee with so much potential and knowledge, but he messes up during the interview because he was too nervous, or he just simply didn't convey what the interviewer wanted to hear. <br></p><p>Well this is going to change! Through this course, we're using our years of experience and techniques to show you what it takes to get the fire started (hint: Tinder ;). We will show you, step-by-step, how to turn your Tinder match into a physical meet-up. And more importantly, how to keep that energy going, so the fire doesn't stop just after one date. </p><p>There's absolutely no better time than now. Tinder is revolutionizing the world of online dating. Now is the time to really master these techniques, so that you will be ahead of the game in this dating world of the 21st century. </p>",
