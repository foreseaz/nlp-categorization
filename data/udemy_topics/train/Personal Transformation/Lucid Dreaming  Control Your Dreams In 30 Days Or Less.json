The instructor's extensive experience with lucid dreaming, the breadth of his study of the literature on the topic, and his enthusiasm for the subject matter are obvious, and the course is very thorough. In addition to the lectures, the instructor provides detailed PDF notes on each section that are very useful for quickly reviewing the subject matter. He also provides quick and very thoughtful answers to students' questions. In addition, this course includes three binaural-beat audio recordings to enhance lucid dreaming, sleep, and meditation, respectively, as well as a list of the books the instructor has found most useful on lucid dreaming.
