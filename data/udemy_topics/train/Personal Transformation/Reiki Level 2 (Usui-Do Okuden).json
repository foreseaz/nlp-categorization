    "description": "<p> Usui-Do is the original style of Reiki. When Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki in Japan, first started his 'Method of Personal Perfection' it was focused on developing onself spiritually. His original students called this 'Usui-Do' (way of Usui).</p><p>BEFORE joining this class you MUST first have completed Reiki Level 1!! </p><p><strong>This course is the second level of Usui-Do which was traditionally called <em>Okuden</em>; the Deep Inside. In this level you'll explore the essence of Reiki more deeply as you are introduced to the SYMBOLS and KOTODAMA (spirit sounds) that Usui originally taught.  </strong></p><p>***</p><p> <strong><em>Reiki Level 1 student says, \"Wonderful Experience</em></strong><em>. I have loved this course. Carmen is a wonderful lecturer whose enthusiasm shines through. I have learnt so much &amp; cannot wait to see what happens in my life now I open to the gorgeous energies. Thank you so much Carmen xx\" </em>~ Dayle Hill</p><p>***</p><p>Training in Usui-Do, or as otherwise known as Reiki, is a non-religious practice of spiritual and personal development. Usui-Do is the name Mikao Usui's (the Founder) students called this spiritual practice (Way of Usui). When this practice first came to the Western world it travelled to us through Dr. Hayashi's student Hawayo Takata. As Dr. Hayashi was focused mainly on the healing abilities our Western world became more familiar with Reiki as a way of healing others. </p><p> The original students of Usui knew this as a method to achieve personal perfection. They focused on reciting the five precepts in meditation daily and practiced the energy exercises. </p><p> They received regular Reiju known as \"Spiritual Blessings\". In our Western version called Reiki we know these as \"attunements\" which were only given to \"attune\" a student to the different levels. In Usui-Do Reiju was given regularly to enhance the student's connection to the Universal Energies. Although there were many health benefits of practicing Usui-Do - these were not focused on. </p><p> When learning and practicing Reiki it's important to acknowledge its original form. Interesting to note, is that Usui always first focused healing on the head. </p><p> It has become well-known that our thoughts create our reality, including our illnesses and dis-ease. Usui was aware of this as he always focused on the head first. When our thoughts are peaceful and joyful our lives improve. This fact is now well known in Positive Psychology. The more positivity (love and joy, etc) we experience in our day-to-day lives the healthier we are including an improved immune system to combat colds and flus, reduced blood pressure, relieve stress and anxiety (and their symptoms), the lessening of headaches and migraines, and so on. </p><p> Reiki has now been proven in scientific research as an effective way to help and heal many ailments and diseases. I've included some of the valuable research in this course for your to peruse. </p><p> But most importantly, you'll be introduced to the traditional techniques of Usui-Do which are powerful energy exercises to boost the overall flow of Universal Energy throughout your body to increase personal change and improve your life. </p><p> This is a very valuable course that you're sure to love. In this course you'll receive: </p> <ul><li>Traditional Healing Techniques</li><li>Three Original Reiki Symbols</li><li>Three Original Kotodama (spirit sounds)</li><li>Usui's Crystal Method</li><li>Your personal Reiju experience.</li></ul> <p> After this course, you'll be fully certified in Reiki Level Two. </p><p>You are encouraged to first focus on healing yourself to improve your thoughts, clear your energies, increase the energy flow throughout your body, and heal past and present issues. When you feel you have a more expansive way of living you will naturally give this healing vibe to others. </p><p> Namaste! </p>",
