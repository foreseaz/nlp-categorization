We've all been there.</p><p>No one is able to stay perfectly focused for any long period of time-it's physically impossible.</p><p>However, while there might be nothing that can keep us from falling asleep in the middle of a boring opera, it is possible to improve our attention capabilities and ability to focus-and this training will show you how. </p><p>Like any other mental skill, such as remembering or doing math in your head, you can increase your ability to focus and to pay attention if you work on those skills.</p><p>That is precisely what you will find in this course.</p><p>Surprisingly, very few people realize the importance of attention skills. As per findings from scientific research, people with the highest attention ability are more productive &amp; successful than others. People who do not pay attention to their daily tasks can waste a lot of time and make costly mistakes. This course will help you be efficient and effective at your work, be less prone to errors, and be much more productive.</p>",
