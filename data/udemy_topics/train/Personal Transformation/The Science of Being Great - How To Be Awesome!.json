    "description": "<p>  \t                &#039;The Science of Being Great: How to Be Awesome&#039; is our treatment of Wallace Wattles&#039; classic from 1910.  </p>  <p>  \t                We&#039;ve done this course as a follow-up to the hugely popular &#039;The Science of Getting Rich&#039; course available right here on Udemy, and it follows exactly the same system for mastery, the 13x4.  </p>  <p>  \t        &#039;The Science of Being Great&#039; takes some of the ideas from &#039;The Science of Getting Rich&#039; to a new level and introduces a whole bunch of even more esoteric, yet beautifully practical perspectives.  </p>  <p>  \t        The principles can be applied by all people, rich or poor, in their quest to become just a little bit more awesome in their everyday lives.  </p>  <p>  \t                This programme will work for people in every interaction with others;  </p>  <p>  \t                for parents and for children,  </p>  <p>  \t                for leaders and for followers,  </p>  <p>  \t                for people in a relationship and for those on their own,  </p>  <p>  \t                for people with ambition, and for people who are happy where they are.  </p>  <p>  \t                It&#039;s a &#039;code of practice&#039; for how to bring greater life to all people with whom you interact, by doing exactly what you do right now.  </p>  <p>  \t        It&#039;s pretty deep stuff, but yet again, it&#039;s so evidently brilliant that it will astonish even the most forward-thinking individuals with its blend of the esoteric and the practical.  </p>  <p>  \t        It&#039;s by far the best work we&#039;ve ever done and we are so very excited to share it with you all.  </p>  <p>  \t        Enjoy, learn, become great and spread the word.  </p>  <p>  \t        All the best,  </p>  <p>  \t                Tom &amp; Angela.  </p>  <p>  \t        October 2014.
