    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     This section is called Connecting the Dots and it is the second of ten sections. This section, Connecting the Dots, is about making sense of the data we uncovered. In this section we take the time to understand a little bit more about our current situation so that we can gain clarity on why we did the things we did, have more compassion around our actions and begin to see the possibility of other options. In the Science track, we look at how the brain decides and how our choices have come to be in our lives. In the Psychology track, we explore limbic resonance and how to re-attach to those we love, even in the midst of our pain. And in the Spirituality track, we learn about the concept: “Being Right vs. Being in Relationship&quot;. And how we continually ask ourselves this question in relation to ourselves (like our body – are we overeating), others (how do we react when someone is late to an appointment) or the world around us (when we get cut off on the freeway). There is only one exercise for all three tracks in this section.  </p>",
