Don't hesitate to take this course!! It can literally change your LIFE.\"</strong></em> ~ Dr. Taffey Wagner</p><p>*****</p>  <p>  \t            Would you believe that positivity has been proven in nearly 300 scientific studies on over 275,000 people to improve life? Yes, I was delightfully surprised  to discover this fact too! (Isn't it great that scientists have researched this?!)  </p>  <p>  \t           The overall findings is that when you activate positivity, with a higher ratio than negativity, your life flicks into a state of flourishing. This means some amazing things will happen in your life!  </p>  <p>  \t            Your energy levels will increase, your confidence and motivation go <em>up up up,</em> your mind opens up to seeing new ideas and possibilities (Have you ever wondered how you're going to get the money to pay for a new car?) AND your health and well-being improve (positivity has been proven to boost your immune system).  </p><p><strong><em>\"The Happiness of Discovering Happiness</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Carmen's course was a great summary of hacks emphasizing the appreciation of happiness and the best paths to get there! Carmen's positive attitude is so infectious and uplifting that you feel like you're getting life advice from your best friend that just so happens to be an expert in positive psychology. I have learned so much about myself by going through this course. The Activate Positivity for Better Living is easy to do and I've already found myself incorporating them into my daily routine. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone regardless of where they are at in their lives. I actually bought this course for a friend of mine. Thank you so much! Best!\"</em></strong> ~ Fernando Mendez</p>  <p>  \t            The results are amazing!  But you MUST be dedicated to activating positivity daily and with different styles too. You see, if you're negativity is higher than your positivity you'll still be floundering so it's important to boost positivity higher.  </p>  <p>The videos in this course (you'll get up close and personal with moi) are upbeat and entertaining as we explore the different ways of how to activate positivity.
