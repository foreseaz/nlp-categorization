    "description": "<p>\r\n\t   My 20/2 plan simply means that <strong>you will be collecting 20 rental checks per month in two years</strong>. You will learn how to begin with buying your first house with little or no money of your own, or any credit for that matter. Part of this program will entail solid education on how to raise other people’s money for your real estate investments. Once you achieve your goal of 20/2, you could consider yourself financially independent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t   You’ll learn how to buy the first units, and fix it for rent/lease purposes. You’ll then get learn the process of renting or leasing for long term holding. Your cash flow will be positive from day one because you’re buying these properties at today’s low prices based on the 1% Rule, which will be explained in this course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t   In short; you buy, fix, stabilize rent, refinance for better terms and hold long term. In time, about 15 years, your properties should all paid off or nearly so, while rents steadily grow to support your very comfortable lifestyle due to inflation. All you have to do is to manage your portfolio well and collect your monthly rents.\r\n</p>",
