    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t This course aims to provide people buying or selling a home with understanding of key real estate terms and concepts.  These are explained through visuals, with supporting voiceover. Each video is short by design, but because visuals convey more information in far less time than text, they cover the subject with better comprehension and recall.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t The course is broadly structured into 8 sections, in the rough order a home buyer might follow. However, the videos are not structured sequentially. Later sections can be used without viewing earlier sections.  End-to-end viewing, preferably NOT in a single sitting, may be helpful for those who have not yet started the home-buying decision process. A complete end-to-end viewing could be done in a few hours.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Those partway through the home-buying process, or those needing refresher knowledge on particular terms or concepts, can jump to specific videos.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Take this course to be an informed home buyer, and (potentially) to save a lot of money by making the best decisions for your situation. It&#039;s the biggest purchase of your life - knowledge pays off.  </p>",
