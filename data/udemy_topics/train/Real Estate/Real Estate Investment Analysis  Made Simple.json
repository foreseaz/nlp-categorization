However, without the proper background knowledge, it becomes an easy way to lose lots of money very quickly. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This course was created for students who want to invest in real estate, but just don't know how to systematically ANALYZE a property's quality and profitability. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How would you evaluate the quality and profitability of an investment property? Would you know how to answer the following questions about any given property?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. How much will it cost you annually to operate the property?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. How much money will you profit per month?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What is your return on investment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. What future repairs or maintenance should you expect? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Does the property have any major defects?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Are there any physical attributes that can help or hurt the property's value?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Is the property well located?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Is this property worth your time and money?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. What is the maximum amount you can afford to invest?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9. How can you be sure that you aren't over paying for the property?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Knowing how to evaluate many different properties is the key to your real estate investing success. You may need to visit and evaluate over 50 properties, before you find yourself a good investment that will make you a lot of money. This is why you need to use the same systematic method. If you don't know how to strategically evaluate properties, you may find yourself in financial trouble very quickly. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Property evaluation is undoubtably the most important skill when it comes to real estate investing. I'm going to be teaching a strategy that I have used during my career as a real estate broker to evaluate over 1 BILLION dollars worth of real estate. </strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best way for you to know if this course is right for you is to take the free Test Quiz in the course introduction (Section 1), titled ''Is This Course Right For Me: Test Quiz''. If you can't answer these 5 questions correctly, then this course is definitely for you. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure to watch all of the free introduction videos in numerical order. By the end of the videos, you will know if this course fits your level of expertise and if it is right for you. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This course costs less than an average haircut. If you don't sign up, then you aren't serious about real estate investing. </strong></p>",
