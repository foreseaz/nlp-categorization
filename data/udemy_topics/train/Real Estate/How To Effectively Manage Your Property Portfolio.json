    "description": "<p>Should you care about your own property, the property you manage for others i.e. landlords (as a property manager or estate agent) this course will help and assist you in your daily tasks to effectively and successfully fulfill those tasks. Many landlord-tenant relationships are strained, but they donâ€™t have to be that way. A rental property owner who knows how to properly manage his rental property and responds promptly to the legitimate concerns of his tenants will be rewarded with good people who stick around. The key is properly maintaining your rental property and constantly investing in upgrades and improvements. By doing this, you can be successful in meeting your long-term financial goals and realize that being a landlord is an excellent primary or secondary income source.</p><p><br></p>",
