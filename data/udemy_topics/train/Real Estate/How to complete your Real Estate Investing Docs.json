I fumbled around for a couple of years before I finally got a deal under contract and I was nervous and it took me about 20 minutes to complete a simple 2 page contract.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    I didn&#039;t have someone to guide me along the way.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    After 14 years and several dozen deals I wanted to help others to bypass the normal learning curve associated with real estate investing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    There is no telling how many more deals I would have done without the painful mistakes if I had someone like myself to help me streamline the buying and selling process...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    and avoid potential landmines and bad deals.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Since the standard real estate purchase and sales agreement is fundamental to any real estate transaction...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    I wanted to take the time to show exactly how to complete a purchase and sales agreement (by filling in a few blanks and signing) and having the confidence to come across to a  prospective seller as a professional real estate investors that does deals regularly.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    A real estate contract is not a big deal and usually your title company or attorney will need you to sign one or two contracts prior to closing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    So basically the initial real estate contract is used to start the process and to lock in your buy price and/or terms.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe second document you will need if you are buying on terms and possibly with cash and that is the AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE INFORMATION to find out the details of the existing mortgage on the property  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This is a free training and I invite newbie investors as well as seasoned investors who are looking to learn how to buy houses with owner financing including &quot;subject to&quot; investing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    I feel the content will be helpful and would a appreciate any suggestions below.  </p><p style=\"\">FREE Real Estate Docs included with the course!!!
