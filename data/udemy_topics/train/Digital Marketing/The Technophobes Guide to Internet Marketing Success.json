    "description": "<p style=\"\">This is a complete foundation course in the same digital marketing principles I used to generate over $70 million (and counting). It covers my 8 principles of internet marketing wisdom using a classroom environment, an interviewer and four cameras, including on-screen to illustrate and prove all my points during the lectures. It is called \"The Technophobes Guide to Internet Marketing Success\" because it has been created so that anyone can understand it. It is especially for small business owners and entrepreneurs. You will find it useful whatever stage of your internet marketing journey you are on because I distill down over 19 years experience into nearly 7 hours of instruction. It includes 3 ebooks on internet marketing terminology, on-page SEO and video marketing to supplement the video material. You should take the course if you want to accelerate your ability to earn money from online marketing.</p>",
