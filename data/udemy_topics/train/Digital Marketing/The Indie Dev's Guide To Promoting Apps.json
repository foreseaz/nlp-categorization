In a world increasingly dominated by freemium apps, we will review how to optimize In-App Purchasing and Mobile Ads. We will dive into what is currently working in user retention and engagement and discuss how to ensure that your users will spend a lot of time with your ads and in-app-purchasing dialogues. Lastly, you will be introduced to Analytics and A/B testing. You will learn how to use data to make good decisions and make good apps that earn more.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Our  course is taught by Mike Hines, Developer Evangelist at Amazon in Seattle, Washington.
