I have seen thousands of tests and I have seen the patterns for success from the best and worst tests. If you are ready to move into the data driven world of testing and you want to learn how to do it right, this course is for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                        Learn what testing is and how testing theory can help your business. In this course, I will introduce you to what it means to grow you testing program as you mature in testing. I will also introduce you the three pillars that every successful testing company needs to understand as they learn more advanced testing theories.
