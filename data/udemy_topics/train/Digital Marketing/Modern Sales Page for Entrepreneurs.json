If you have ever struggled to write sales copy that converts, this course is for you. If you have something to sell, but you don’t know where to start, this course is for you. Even if you already have someone writing for you (or a team of writers), this course can help you guide them in the right direction. </p><br><p>You don’t have to be a professional writer to understand the concepts I teach. I’ll break down the different parts of a modern sales page (headline, features, close, etc.) and I’ll also show you simple formulas and shortcuts for writing each section. The best part is, you’ll get useful sales page template and a nifty cheat sheet that will make the process even easier. Can’t wait to see you in class.</p>",
