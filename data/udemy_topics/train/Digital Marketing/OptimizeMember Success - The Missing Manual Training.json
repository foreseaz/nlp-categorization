    "description": "<p><strong>Create Profitable Membership Sites With OptimizeMember Quickly and Hassle Free</strong></p><p><strong>Last Update: March 2016</strong></p><p>OptimizeMember is a fully functioning membership system .Giving you powerful features you need to run a membership site.</p><p>The Problem is that there are a lot of options, lots of gotchas and little training. In fact until you have created and launched a membership site you won't know what you've done wrong.</p><p><strong>TAKE THE COURSE TODAY</strong></p><p>For example most people don't change the default welcome email at all. As a result it mainly gets sent to customer's Junk/Spam Mail Folder. If it does arrive the instructions just lead to confuse your new member, generating support emails and headaches for you.</p><p><strong>Create It Right First Time...</strong></p><p>The OP2 Member Master Course takes you step by step through creating a site the right way. Watch over the shoulder as a real life product site is created. Follow along step by step.</p><p><em>\"I was worried it would not be detailed enough for a beginnerâ€¦. This was a life saver! I had already purchased OP2 and was trying to learn how to use the Membership feature. Unfortunately, OP2 Membership does not come with detailed instructions and since I am a beginner, was very confused by the whole process and worried I had wasted my money on OP2. I was left to find my own resources for learning which was very time consuming. All changed when I found OP2 Member Master. What a life saver.\" - <strong>Julie Siomacco</strong></em></p><p><em>\"Ease of understanding, clear step by step instruction and completeness (all aspects of a membership site). I would recommend the OP2 Member Master because the training is complete and removes the need for trial and error.\" - <strong>Anthony Smith</strong></em></p><p><strong>P.S. Don't forget that using the OptimizeMember Missing Manual Course you will be taken by the hand step by step through creating your own membership site with OptimizeMember from start to finish. Giving you a product to sell that you are proud of. You can do it the easy way or keep struggling by passing up this course.</strong></p>",
