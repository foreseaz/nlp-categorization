This is expanded to cover the requirement to build an ongoing relationship with each subscriber such that your push notification program is not subject to large-scale unsubscribes and viewed as spam communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a push notification subscriber base is just as valuable as building an email subscriber base. However, it is not as easyÂ as merely implementing a push notification program as there are some considerable dangers you can be exposed to if you select the wrong push notification service provider. You could end up not owning your subscriber base and be locked into their service for the foreseeable future. We cover how to select a service provider that does not penalise you like this and focus on the important items that you actually must own such that you can control your own subscribers and future communications with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this rapidly evolving area we also touch upon future developments and consider some of the opportunities which may arise in the next few months.</p>",
