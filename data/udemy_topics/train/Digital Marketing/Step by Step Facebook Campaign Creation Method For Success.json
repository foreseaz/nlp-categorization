Ever since then, I split off two departments of Zebra Advertisement and turned them into additional companies, 1DollarAd and International PPC. Together with my lovely business partner and wife and our dog, we travel the world as digital nomads and <strong>help marketers and entrepreneurs to get better results on Facebook</strong> and other platforms.</p><p>The best part of traveling is of course that I get to meet some of you guys along the way at our Meet &amp; Greets. I started noticing that most of the questions I get during the get-togethers are about Facebook Ads.</p><p>So instead of scheduling individual consulting sessions that are expensive, I thought what better way than to share everything there is to know about Facebook Ads via an online course? Many of the <strong>awards and nominations I have received were based on successful Facebook campaigns</strong> and the integration of Facebook Ads with other platforms such as Google AdWords.</p><p>I have tested over 200k Facebook ads and have based this Facebook training on everything I have learned over the last couple of years.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>What’s included</strong></p><p>Advanced Facebook Marketing is not only about the basics. I will train you on cool things like the few examples above.</p><p>Signing up for this course will give you a completely new approach to Facebook marketing. Our motto is: “ Segment, test and test again!”</p><p>Segmenting and testing is the secret to a successful Facebook campaign. Our course includes 8 modules that will cover everything there is to know about Facebook, 3 basic modules for the students that would like to learn more about the basics, podcasts based on the questions that we receive from our students and bonus material to cover the most recent Facebook updates.</p><p>I am aware that Facebook isn’t a static platform and therefore I am going to create content weekly to update you on:</p><ul><li>Best practices in the market</li><li>New Facebook products</li><li>Effective techniques that I tested on I 17k+ campaigns I manage monthly</li><li>Common Q&amp;A</li><li>Everything you need to succeed at Facebook Marketing!</li></ul><p>\"The Step by Step Facebook Campaign Method for Success\" is ideal for:</p><ul><li>Businesses that want to focus their Facebook Campaigns on website conversions</li><li>Businesses that want to use Facebook marketing at an advanced level but don’t want to hire external consultants</li><li>Businesses that want to do more than just boosting a post</li><li>Businesses that are afraid to waste money and would like to understand how Facebook marketing works</li><li>Agencies that want to train their account managers with rock solid Facebook marketing techniques</li></ul><p><strong>Don't wait any longer to gain the know how you need to develop a competitive advantage on your competition.
