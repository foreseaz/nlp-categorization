That&#039;s why this course also discusses practical strategies in email marketing, and shows you useful case studies to help you improve your subscription conversion rates. We&#039;ll also discuss writing subject lines that will make your subscribers want to open your email (as opposed to immediately marking it as SPAM before they read it), and writing crystal clear Calls to Action that will prompt your audience to proceed in the direction you would like them to. When done correctly, email marketing can be a win-win situation for both your business, and for your subscribers.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"> </strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">SAY WHAT?
