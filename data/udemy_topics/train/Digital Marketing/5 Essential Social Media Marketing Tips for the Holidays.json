You will learn how to create and promote dark posts on Facebook, create a loop giveaway on Instagram, the proper way to use Direct Message on Instagram, discover useful apps for storytelling, how to take better images with your cell phone and more. My screencasts show you exactly how to do all of these things by capturing video directly from my computer screen and cell phone. My style is truly from one girlfriend to another.
