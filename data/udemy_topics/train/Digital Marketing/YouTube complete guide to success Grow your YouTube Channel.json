Once completing the academy you get YouTube certified.</p><p style=\"\">I&#039;ve done a lot of research on YouTube, tried every strategy that I could find. Additionally I had lots of data from my own channels that helped guide me to a better understanding of what WORKS.</p><p style=\"\">I found that to be successful on YouTube it takes time. Lots and lots of time. Time is limited and if you want to get a maximum return on it you need to be able to put aside the fluff and work smarter. I found that many YouTube channel owners were not working as efficiently and effectively as they could. If you are looking to profit from YouTube then time is money. The more time you spend the less you make per hour and so onâ€¦. Stop wasting time on things that don&#039;t work and focus on what does.</p><p style=\"\">I believe in data driven results, if base your strategy on the results from the data you will be able to improve and tweak your videos to grow your channel.
