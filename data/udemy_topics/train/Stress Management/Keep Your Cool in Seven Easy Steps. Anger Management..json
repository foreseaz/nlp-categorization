    "description": "<p>“This course is not sponsored by or affiliated with Udemy, Inc.” Anger is a response to what life brings or what happens around us. Everyone has reasons to be angry from time to time. There are many injustices in the world. Sometimes anger is justified. Our angry feelings are a red flag that we perceive an event as not fair or not right. The anger is not what gets us into trouble. What causes problems is a destructive response to our anger. What we do with anger and how we express anger determine if the outcome is positive or negative. The best predictor to a positive outcome is your willingness to take an honest look at the consequences to your anger expression and to examine your process of how you express this negative emotion.</p>\n\n<p>This class will give you tools to express your anger in a healthy manner. Real time tested effective anger management methods to keep your cool. Communicate effectively, stay calm, lower stress, lower anxiety, keep your power feelings, and stay out of trouble.</p>",
