    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     Welcome to this e-learning course on <em style=\"\">Managing Stress</em>. It has been developed as a follow up to our <em style=\"\">Dealing with Stress </em>course. While everyone, whether staff or manager, has a responsibility to keep their pressures within manageable limits and avoid harmful stress, managers have additional responsibilities in relation to stress. This is because they have a duty of care towards their staff; they have a responsibility to play their part in helping to ensure that all employees are safeguarded from health-affecting stress.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The course is the approximate equivalent of half a day of continuous professional development. It builds on the foundations of understanding provided by the <em style=\"\">Dealing with Stress </em>course, but focuses specifically on the managerial responsibilities. It offers the opportunity for managers to develop a clear picture of what they can do to make sure that they keep stress at bay.  </p>",
