    "description": "<p>Over the last 12 years I have been helping people with anxiety and stress which can cause panic attacks. </p><p>These are caused by the stress system over loading and producing the distressing and frightening symptoms of a panic attack.</p><p>Unfortunately panic attacks can affect anyone and strike without warning. This course is a programme to change the way you think, feel and act , As a result you will have much less chance of having a panic attack.</p><p>I've presented this course programme both 1 to 1 and in group sessions, In both formats peoples lives change as they learn to think differently, relax easily and feel so much better.</p><p>The whole point of this course is to stop you having panic attacks by stopping what is actually causing them. That is usually fear. Sometimes you're aware of what the fear is. Sometimes you're actually unaware of the fear as it's below the surface. This course will help you expose that and deal with it.</p><p>The course uses video files, audio files and PDFs with easy digestible content. </p><p>The main purpose of the course is for you to stop the panic attacks, identify what is causing them, and to deal with that too quickly.</p><p>The tools and strategies can be used over and over again.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
