    "description": "<p>A client of mine suffers from anxiety. She had a serious problem in her life that had just recently triggered one of the worst anxiety attacks she had experienced in a long time. It was so intense that just telling me about the problem triggered an attack! She was completely melting down. Fortunately, I have a huge toolbox of techniques to work with my clients that include several tools to deal with intense emotion - including severe anxiety attacks and even phobias. Once you know it, this technique takes less than two minutes to stop an anxiety attack. Here, I share with you exactly what I did with my real-life client to help her get out of her very serious anxiety attack.</p>",
