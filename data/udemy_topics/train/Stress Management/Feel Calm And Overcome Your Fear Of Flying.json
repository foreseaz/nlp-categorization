The course is in four parts which can be used independently on different days or run as one continuous piece. Each part can be watched as many times as needed. Because I believe you deserve the very best help these sessions are in-depth - the same way I would run a session if you were coming to see me but for a fraction of the cost.</p><p style=\"\">I&#039;ll explain what has been happening in your mind and how to undo any fears and trauma. I&#039;ll give you lots of techniques to use whenever you think about flying and when you&#039;re on a plane.</p><p style=\"\">My own experience of a fear of flying means I fully understand what you&#039;ve been feeling and I know too how you can be free to join me in now looking forward to and enjoying flights.</p>",
