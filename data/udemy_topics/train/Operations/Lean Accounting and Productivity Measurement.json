    "description": "<p><em></em><em><span></span></em>A strong reason <em>Lean Accounting</em> gained prominence is because traditional accounting systems were essentially backwards looking, and are not able to reflect accurately the improvements through Lean. The point to remember is that lean accounting is undoubtedly a major improvement over the status quo, but must still not be used to control the financial performance of the firm. Even though lean accounting will provide you with much better information, it is important to understand that the financial performance is an emergent outcome of the relationships among the organizationâ€™s parts. Managers should not use financial targets to control financial results, instead, manage the relationships that produce these results.</p><p>Lean manufacturing is concerned with eliminating waste in manufacturing processes. Promised benefits included such outcomes as reduced lead times, improved quality, improved on-time deliveries, less inventory, less space, less human effort, lower costs, and increased profitability. </p><p>Lean accounting is a simplified approach to costing that supports lean manufacturing with both financial and non-financial measures. One key area that supports efficiency improvement is productivity measurement, which is concerned with the relationship between outputs and inputs. As waste decreases through lean manufacturing practices, productive efficiency should increase.</p><p><strong>Content and Overview:</strong><br></p><p>This course contains 10 lectures, over 1.5 hours of content, and a quiz containing 15 questions.
