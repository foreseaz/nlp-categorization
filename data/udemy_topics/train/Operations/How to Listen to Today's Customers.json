    "description": "<p>  \t  Most companies still operate as if they control their customers.  But, in today&rsquo;s market, it&rsquo;s really the other way around.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.  This course is based on Chuck Wall&rsquo;s book, <em style=\"\">Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t  Today&rsquo;s customers can crucify any business, whether that business deserves it or not. You can&rsquo;t underestimate the power of an angry customer. The statistics are overwhelming: an unhappy customer will tell at least twelve people know about his bad experience. Those twelve will tell six more. Those six will tell three of their friends and in no time, a single bad experience will have been shared with almost four hundred people. Social media platforms can magnify that number exponentially.  Everyone carries a phone that has become both a tool and a weapon.  If you aren&rsquo;t listening, you&rsquo;ll never know what hit you.  On the other hand, social media has opened the door to proactive listening and engagement with customers to hear their ideas like never before.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will help you better understand the critically important role the Power of the Platform can play in your enterprise.  You will hear case studies from Morton&rsquo;s Steakhouse, JetBlue, and Dell.  You will also work through two hands-on exercises to better understand how the Power of the Platform works.  </p>  <p>  \t  Every student who successfully completes this course will receive a Certificate of Completion.  </p>  <p>  \t  We look forward to sharing much more about the Power of the Platform with you!  </p>",
