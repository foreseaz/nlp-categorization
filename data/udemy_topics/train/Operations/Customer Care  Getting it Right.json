    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     How  people are treated by organisations when they first make contact can be  crucial. As the saying goes, if you don&#039;t look after your customers, someone else will. Developed by highly respected author, educator and expert in communication skills, Professor  Bernard Moss, this important e-learning module offers the equivalent of a  full dayâ€™s continuous professional development. This is ideal training  for receptionists or anyone whose role brings them into face-to-face  contact with the public in private, voluntary or public sector  organisations. This course provides an excellent foundation for  high-quality customer care.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course is built around a set of acted-out scenes in which you get to see examples of how to provide high-quality customer care and - importantly - telling examples of how not to do it. This approach enables you to get a clear picture of what is involved in effective customer care.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Participants are provided with a Module Companion E-book which can be printed out to act as a focal point for taking notes about the important insights the course provides and for completing the exercises that are an integral part of the learning.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Although the course is the equivalent of a full-day&#039;s training, it does not have to be taken in one sitting. It can be followed flexibly to fit in with your busy schedule and at a pace to suit you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If your work involves you in welcoming people to your organisation - whether in a commercial or a public service setting - this course will help you to make sure you do this to the best of your ability.  </p>",
