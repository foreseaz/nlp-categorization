    "description": "<p>We will discuss a lean approach to reducing and conserving environmental impacts in your facility or a business you work with. The WASTE Walk is an approach to engage employees and co-workers in identifying simple, \"low-hanging fruit\" environmental wastes occurring in your processes. This \"gemba walk\" event format can help you reduce costs and save money, reduce carbon emissions and health risks in the community, improve the reputation of the organization, and become good stewards of the environment. No prior lean experience needed. Three different types of events will be discussed: Water Walk, Dumpster Dive and Energy Walk. Included in the training are templates for planning your WASTE Walk, and an Impact-Ease Matrix to prioritize ideas. </p><p>Upon completion of this course, you will be able to plan and conduct a simple WASTE walk to help a business reduce trash, energy or water usage and save money. <br></p><p>Course Length: 48 minutes</p>",
