    "description": "<p>  \t  Most companies still operate as if they control their customers.  But, in today&rsquo;s market, it&rsquo;s really the other way around.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.  This course is based on Chuck Wall&rsquo;s book, <em style=\"\">Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t  Rock and Roll Hall of Famer David Lee Roth, of Van Halen fame, spoke for a lot of us when he said, &ldquo;Money can&rsquo;t buy happiness, but it can buy a huge yacht that sails right next to it.&rdquo;  When we ponder the idea of what&rsquo;s something&rsquo;s worth, it is hard to put our finger on it. Value is something different for each person.  Why does one person not care about the kind of cell phone he talks on, while another will stand in line several days and nights to be among the first to possess the latest iPhone version? Everyone marches to the beat of his or her own drummer when it comes to the subject of value.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will help you better understand the Power of Value with case studies from major brands like Costco, Yellow Tail Wine, and Hyundai.  You will also work through two hands-on exercises to better understand how the Power of Value affects your business.  </p>  <p>  \t  Every student who successfully completes this course will receive a Certificate of Completion.  </p>  <p>  \t  We look forward to sharing much more about the Power of Value with you!  </p>",
