    "description": "<p>  \t  Most companies still operate as if they control their customers.  But, in today&rsquo;s market, it&rsquo;s really the other way around.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.  This course is based on Chuck Wall&rsquo;s book, <em style=\"\">Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t  Every contact with the customer, whether positive or negative, is a moment of truth for every company.  In order to identify and create better moments of truth, companies have to shift their thinking to the Power of Yes. Yes companies deliver &ldquo;moments of magic.&rdquo;  Today&rsquo;s customers expect and demand no less. This is the Power of Yes in action.  Companies that understand this consistently look at their businesses from the customer&rsquo;s point of view. Then they figure out ways to empower their frontline people to stop saying no. By practicing no &ldquo;no&rdquo; these companies profit handsomely by earning their customers&rsquo; loyalty.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will help you better understand the Power of Yes with case studies from Discount Tire and Holt Cat.  You will learn why saying yes is always better than saying no.  You will also work through two hands-on exercises to better understand how the Power of Yes can work for you.  </p>  <p>  \t  Every student who successfully completes this course will receive a Certificate of Completion.  </p>  <p>  \t  We look forward to sharing much more about the Power of Yes with you!  </p>",
