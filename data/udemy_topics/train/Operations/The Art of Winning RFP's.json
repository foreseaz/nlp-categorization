    "description": "<p></p><p>Service  provider competition has never been more brutal. As markets mature and  competition increases, the perceived differences between you and your best  competitors decrease. You are probably feeling increasingly commoditized as  clients begin to view you and your competitors as pretty much the same. Your  win rate may be decreasing. More decisions are being made on price, and  competitors are “buying” the business with low-ball bids. But you also may be  the victim of your own loss of identity because your message and tactics have  not evolved with your client’s increased choice. </p>    The best way to win RFP&#039;s (request for proposals), is to make sure you understand how and why clients choose one&nbsp;competitor&nbsp;over another, and how elite providers align and win without competing on price, fees or rates. This is the same program that we offer to our professional, financial and commercial real estate clients internationally.<br><p></p>  ",
