    "description": "<p>  \t  Most companies still operate as if they control their customers.  But, in today&rsquo;s market, it&rsquo;s really the other way around.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.  This course is based on Chuck Wall&rsquo;s book, <em style=\"\">Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers. </em>  </p>  <p>  \t  Things either work or they don&rsquo;t. For customers, there really is no middle ground. The question is why there are so many products that don&rsquo;t work.  Most experts agree that more than ninety percent of new products fail. Sometimes the product is poorly marketed. Other times, it is a brand extension that is so far afield of the root brand that potential buyers are confused. But usually it is because the product just doesn&rsquo;t do what the customer needs it to do in the first place.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will help you better understand the Power of Performance with case studies from major brands like Apple and Dyson.  You will also work through two hands-on exercises to better understand how the Power of Performance can revolutionize your company.  </p>  <p>  \t  Every student who successfully completes this course will receive a Certificate of Completion.  </p>",
