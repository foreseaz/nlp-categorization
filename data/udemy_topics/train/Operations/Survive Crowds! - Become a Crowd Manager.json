    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tThe role of the Crowd Manager is simple: Prevent a sudden crowd surge that may cause injury or death.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe Crowd Manager Course satisfies the requirement from NFPA in a “place of assembly” that hold 50 or more people. We choose to come together or “assemble” in this way for recreational, business and worship reasons.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis class prepares you and/or your event staff with the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to fulfill these roles and responsibilities:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Assess the venue for hazards</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Create a facility plan</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Evaluate all hazards including severe weather and violence</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Safely manage and direct a group of 50 or more people that assemble for business, recreation, worship or business reasons. </li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \tClass time is expected to be 3-4 hours with case study and case study quizzes. These types of assembly are all around us in every size community every day (and night) and may include:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tArmories  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAssembly Halls  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAuditoriums  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tBowling Lanes  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tClub Rooms  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCollege classrooms  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCourtrooms  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tDance Halls  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tDrinking Establishments  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tExhibition Halls  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tGymnasiums  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLibraries  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMortuary chapels  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMotion picture theaters  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMuseums  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tPassenger stations  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tPlaces of religious worship  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tPool rooms  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tRecreation piers  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tRestaurants  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tSkating rinks  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tSpecial amusement buildings (i.e.: haunted houses)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tTheaters  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tFundraiser events  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tNon-profit events  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tDuring an emergency, event patrons often have to make decisions about where the best exit is located, when to exit and how to remain safe. The crowd manager plans for emergencies at each venue to keep people safe. They can manage and direct the audience to a safe exit before injury or death occurs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tYou will study crowd psychology and learn the FIST method of management:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tF  -The Crowd Force (or energy)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI   -The Information upon which the crowd acts  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tS  -The physical Space involved both in terms of individual density and larger scale architectural features  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tT- Time the duration of the incident.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tTerms you will know at the end of the class are:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCritical occupancy-Critical occupancy is the gradual accumulation and overloading of a pedestrian space, beginning at levels below 3 ft<sup style=\"\">2</sup>/person (0.28 m<sup style=\"\">2</sup>/person) until it reaches the plan view area of the human body of about 1.3 to 1.5 ft<sup style=\"\">2</sup> (0.12 to 0.14 m<sup style=\"\">2</sup>).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tFlight Response-The flight response occurs where people are fleeing either from a real threat, such as a fire or explosion, or from a perceived, but otherwise nonthreatening, event. Flight responses may be labeled as panics and stampedes, but closer examination shows that rapid group movement away from the threat was a reasonable reaction.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCraze-A craze is a competitive rush to obtain some highly valued objective. Crazes may happen when spectators attempt to get closer to celebrities, gain entry into a popular event, or, more unfortunately, where food is being distributed to starving victims of a disaster.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCrowd Surge-A crowd surge occurs when the energy of a crowd increases to the point the crowd surges forward in a wave. In this class you will study the effects of a crowd surge and see a crowd surge in action.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCrowd Manager Supervisor-A crowd manager supervisor receives additional training in incident management, planning and directing their team. Crowd Managers have a higher level of training and may fulfill duties in the event command room or command post along with public safety, event management, venue management, ambulance services and other partners.
