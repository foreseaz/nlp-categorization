    "description": "<p>  \t  Explore the most popular customer service resource known as Help Desk. A Help Desk is an information and assistance resource that troubleshoots problems with computers or similar products. Corporations often provide Help Desk support to their customers via a toll-free number, Web site and/or e-mail. There are also in-house Help Desks geared toward providing the same kind of help for employees only. Some schools offer classes in which they perform similar tasks as a Help Desk.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will begin with discussions on defining and presenting the objectives and functions of the Help Desk. The succeeding modules will differentiate Customer Service and Product Support, Technical and Customer Support, and the different types of Customer Relationship Management.  </p>",
