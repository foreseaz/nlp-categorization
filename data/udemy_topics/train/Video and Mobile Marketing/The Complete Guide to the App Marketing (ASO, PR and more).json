    "description": "<p>After a few app launches of our own, observing many more, talking with several app developers and testing cool services, we have a really good idea of what can be done to <strong>make an app a success</strong>.<br></p><p>There are roughly 1.5 million apps on each the iOS App Store and Google Play so it is easy for your app to get lost among them. There are so many developers that spend time, energy, and money developing an app, but when they upload it the returns are nowhere near what they were expecting. This is because they focus their time and energy in building the app, but not in optimizing it to be found. They have no thoughts about app marketing, analytics, marketing campaigns. What if I told you that there is a way to <em>avoid your app getting lost among the huge pool of apps in the app stores</em>?

There is a tonne of things to learn about mobile marketing, and they always keep changing as people try new things and the rules in the app stores change.
