So in this specific video we are going to not only plan ahead, but I'm going to show you how to do some basic research so you have an idea of the other podcasts in your niche.<br> <br> <strong>Video #3:  Writing a Intro and Outro Script (Copy and Paste This)<br> </strong>Writing what we call the intro and outro is important. Basically, this is the beginning and the end of your podcast. The ‘intro’ is what introduces you as the expert and speaker. Doing this wrong can actually backfire, so you want to make sure you do it the right way. The ‘outro’ allows a person to take action. Fortunately for you, you get the copy and paste script so you don't really have to think about what you should write - just fill in the details.<br> <br> <strong>Video #4:  Hire Voiceover Artist for Intro and Outro<br> </strong>While you can create your own intro and outro, it's better to get somebody else to introduce you, and then you introduce yourself, especially when you're trying to position yourself as the expert. Therefore, in this specific video I'm going to show you two sites that you can use to hire voiceover artists for fairly cheap.  I'm also going to discuss what types of voiceover artists you should hire for your specific podcast, because it can vary from niche to niche.<br> <br> <strong>Video #5:  Microphone and Software Editing Tools<br> </strong>We all know that having the right microphone and software editing tools is a huge factor, so here we're going to cover specific types of microphones.

However, bear in mind thatwith iTunes you can always upload video as well, so I'll ensure that I cover video editing software tools.<br> <br> <strong>Video #6:  Record Your Podcast (How to Create Soundproof Environments) <br> </strong>Now that we have laid out the groundwork, it is time to record your podcast. But the big question remains - how can you record your podcasts in such a manner that you can remove all of the room sound? For example, how can you create a soundproof environment when you have a noisy neighbor or house?  You'll learn some shocking truths as to how to create a soundproof environment with items that you most likely already have.<br> <br> <strong>Video #7:  Edit Your Main Podcast Yourself<br> </strong>Once you have recorded your podcasts you still need to edit them.
