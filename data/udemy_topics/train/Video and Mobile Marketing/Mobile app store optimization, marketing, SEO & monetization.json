I realize that you may be excited about your app idea, and rush to have it built as soon as possible. But as an app entrepreneur, you need to understand what it takes to make your app a real business that makes money.  </p>  <p>  \t                This course teaches you about app business models, high level business strategies and app business planning. This is what makes this course special! This course will make you a strong business person, and a stronger app entrepreneur.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>My Background</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                            I am an independent developer (Problemio business apps) and I have gotten a cumulative 500,000+ downloads for my apps without spending any money on marketing. My app ranked #1 for the search \"business\" on Android for over a year, and many of my apps dominate their search rankings in app stores.  </p>  <p>  \t                In this course I teach you the insights and secrets I learned while growing my own mobile app business. Everything I teach in this course is something I have done and tried myself.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>How The Course Is Structured</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                        The course is almost all video. It will take between 2 to 3 hours to complete. After you finish the course, you should be much stronger in overall mobile app business strategy, mobile app marketing and mobile app monetization.  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                                   The course is structured in 3 parts. The first part goes over some of the common mobile app fundamentals. If you are working on your first app, this is a must!  </p>  <p>  \t        The second part of the course focuses on how to monetize your app. And the third part of the course gives you many effective strategies for how to promote your app to get a large number of downloads!  </p><p>I also show you some of my favorite tools and outsourcing strategies that you can use for your own app development and growth.</p>  <p>  \t<strong>Why You Should Take This Course Now</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            You might think that you will focus on the marketing and monetization strategies after your app is build and has launched. But that is a very costly mistake made by many first-time entrepreneurs.  </p>  <p>  \t            This course will shed light on many parts of your business strategy, and allow you to choose a far more successful path for your app from the very beginning. That is why you should take this course before even writing the first line of code for your app.  </p>  <p>  \t            Luckily, the course only takes between 2-3 hours to complete. So you can transform yourself and become a much stronger app entrepreneur in less than half a day. Take the curse today, and see for yourself.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Still Wondering If The Course Is Right For You?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                I understand that before taking the course you might have doubts about whether it will actually help you.  </p>  <p>  \t                I can assure you that I put all my knowledge into this course, and made it as insightful as I could for you. I also continue to look for interesting topics, and add new lectures to the course.  </p>  <p>  \t                 But don't take my word for it. Every Udemy course has a 30-day money back guarantee.
