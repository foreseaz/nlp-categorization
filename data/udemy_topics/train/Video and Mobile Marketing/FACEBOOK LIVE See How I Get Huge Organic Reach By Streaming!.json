I personally found it daunting at first! But once I got my first one out of the way, I found it a LOT of fun! I have been building loyal audiences on both Facebook and Periscope. However, Facebook Live allows you to connect your brand with the 1.65 billion people that are on Facebook, and Facebook are giving Live users a place <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">at</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> the top</strong> of fan's timelines. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">That means a ton of organic traffic is just waiting for you to collect and convert!</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, I give you the confidence, ideas and structure to be able to stream live video on Facebook.

Now is the time to start broadcasting your expertise, whether it is how to grow a successful niche business or how to apply make up properly. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To become a student, find the blue \"take this course\" button or the \"start free preview\" button above to enroll.
