    "description": "<p>  \tIn this course you will learn how to build your own C and C Cage from scratch. You&#039;ll learn what c and c means, where you can get your supplies and you&#039;ll also learn how to build a second story to your C and C Cage with a ramp. We&#039;ll also look at what kinds of bedding you can use in this type of cage. This type of cage is well suited for Guinea Pigs and Rabbits if there is a top, which we do not cover in this course but after you take this course, you&#039;d be able to do with what you&#039;ve learned. Chinchillas are not good candidates for these cages as they are known to get their heads stuck in the grids. Hamsters, Gerbils, Mice and Rats could get out to easily I would think, though I have seen Rats in one that just had correx with extra high sides.  </p>  <p>  \tMost C and C Cages are for Guinea Pigs though.  </p>  <p>  \tSomewhere in the mix we&#039;ll also take a break and enjoy some Piggy fun, with some adorable Piggies!  </p>",
