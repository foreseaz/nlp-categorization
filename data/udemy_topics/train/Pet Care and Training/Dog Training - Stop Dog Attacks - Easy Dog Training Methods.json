Dogs speak the same language regardless of age or breed. The dog training methods you'll learn will work with your dog, your friend's and family's dogs and any other future dogs you may get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs are not like computers they do not require constant updates or need to have new dog training programs developed, once you know what to do you've got it! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What You'll Get From This Dog Training Course.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dog training course is designed for any dog owner, regardless of their experience, who would like help with their dog's aggressive behaviour towards other dogs. This could be 'dominant aggression' where dogs charge at other dogs with intent to harm, 'fearful aggression' where dogs lunge, bark and show teeth but then go backwards and try to avoid conflict, or dogs who simply snap as if to say 'get out of my personal space.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dog training course focuses on empowering you, the dog owner. You're given the tools, knowledge and dog training methods in order to get your dog to listen to you and respond favourably to what you say. You're shown exactly how to do this through step-by-step video demonstrations using the pack leader theory combined with positive reinforcement techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You'll learn how to recognize dominant and submissive signals so that you can avoid a potential dog attack from happening, dog training techniques that integrate aggressive dogs with other dogs as well as the crucial part you play in your dog's aggressive behaviour - when you are nervous and fearful of what might happen you are transferring that anxiety to your dog and setting yourself up for what you don't want to happen! I show you how to create good expectations instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You'll also find out why getting your dog to walk by your side first is vital to your success and step-by-step video demonstrations of how to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You'll also learn dog training methods that will convince your dog, in a kind and confident way, that you are in charge, the one that is making all the decisions and that it is not their job to protect you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this course you'll discover why dogs attack some dogs and are fine with others, why some dogs are 'picked on' and why some dogs don't like black dogs. As well as why some dogs don't like certain breeds, why some dogs don't like dogs that have not been neutered and why some dogs are aggressive on the leash and are good natured when off the leash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this dog training course you'll have the knowledge and confidence you need to make a positive difference to your dog's aggressive behaviour. You'll also know how you can become your dog's Pack Leader without shouting, hitting or using force in this area. As well as confirmation of where you are already doing things right and suggestions where some dog training 'fine tuning' may be beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine going on a walk feeling calm and confident with your dog responding favourably to you, following your lead and being focused on you rather than another dog. That's what you can look forward to after completing this dog training course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can it really be that easy? Absolutely!
