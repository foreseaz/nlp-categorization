You're given the tools, knowledge and dog training methods in order to get your dog to listen to you and respond favourably to what you say. You're shown exactly how to do the dog training methods through step-by-step video demonstrations using the pack leader theory combined with positive reinforcement techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>During this dog training course you'll learn precisely how to stop your dog from barking incessantly when someone comes to the front door and how to cease barking in the back yard on your command.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll also learn dog training techniques that convince your dog, in a kind and confident way, that you are in charge and that their job is to alert you, as the pack leader, that there is potential danger rather than demonstrating uncontrollable territorial behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>During this dog training course you'll  also discover why the postman/mailman makes dog barking 10 times worse plus the crucial part you play - your reaction and what you say can either calm the situation or encourage more frenzied behaviour from your dog. This dog training course will teach you how to give the right message to your dog which causes them to relax and trust in your decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course you'll have the dog training knowledge and confidence you need to make a positive difference to your dogs incessant barking when someone comes to the front door and in the back garden/yard. You'll also know how you can become your dogs pack leader without shouting, hitting or using force, in this area. As well as confirmation of where you are already doing things right and suggestions where some 'fine tuning' may be beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine someone coming to your front door or a disturbance in your back garden/yard, your dog barks to let you know that someone's there and stops barking straight away when you say, that's what you can look forward to after completing this dog training course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Can it really be that easy?
