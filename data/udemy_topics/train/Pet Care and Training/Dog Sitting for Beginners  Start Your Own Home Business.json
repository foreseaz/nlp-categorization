With so many kennels getting a bad rap these days, dog boarding had gone in a new direction - owners are much happier bringing their pup to a loving home while they are away on vacation or traveling for business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t</p><p style=\"\">  \t\t  This course will show you how to immediately start getting inquires from people who want to pay you $20 to $50 per night to board their dog!  If you are willing to board two or three dogs at a time, you could earn up to $150 per night.  In one week that would be $1,050!  When the week is up, the dogs go home with their owner and you get paid via PayPal within 24 hours!  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t</p><p style=\"\">  \t\t\t  The best part is that you are not \"starting a business\" or building a website or doing any advertising whatsoever!  Simply follow this course, start fielding inquiries and YOU decide what dogs you want to board and what days you are available.  This is the PERFECT way for any dog lover to make some nice monthly cash!  \t\t</p>",
