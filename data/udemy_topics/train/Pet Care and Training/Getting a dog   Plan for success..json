    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course has over two and a half hours of content about adding a dog to your home.  Whether you are a first time dog owner or long time dog owner, it is important to take personal inventory of your abilities and circumstances before you get or add a dog.  Although we cannot see into the future, we can make a thorough assessment and have a discussion with others in our home to prevent any of the problems that come with adding a dog to the family.  This course contains worksheets and other resources to help you and those who live with you figure out if you are ready for a dog, what kind of dog to get, where to get the dog and how to structure your first month home.  </p>",
