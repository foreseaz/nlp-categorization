The course is divided into 6 lectures, which range in length from 15 to 40 minutes.  All lectures contain Power Point slides to reinforce key points; some include worksheets to help you evaluate your child&#039;s functioning and gain clarity about how to effectively intervene.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;This is a great resource for any parent interested in empowering their child to protect and sustain their sense of resilience, self-esteem, and body image. &quot;  -Jane Shure, PhD, LCSW, author of Inside/Outside Self-Discovery for Teens: Strategies to Promote Resilience, Relationships, &amp; Positive Body Image and Co-editor of Effective Clinical Practice in the Treatment of Eating Disorders: The Heart of the Matter\r\n</p>",
