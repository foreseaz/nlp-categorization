It helps us to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and energized to start the day.

The way you plan your day has a big effect on how well you sleep at night, which is why we start by teaching you how to align your day to the Circadian Rhythm and explain the different factors that affect your sleep, such as light exposure, body temperature and several hormones like serotonin, adenosine and cortisol. We also teach you how you can control these factors so that they will help you sleep well at night. </p><p>With these topics mastered, the course moves on to more advanced methods to improve the quality of your sleep, such as self hypnosis, meditation, breathing techniques and sleep restriction. A section on step-by-step advice for insomniacs is also provided. </p><p>Finally, we'll also cover how to effectively use naps during the day and how to control your dreams at night. </p><p><strong>Who should take this course? </strong></p><p>We designed this course for anyone who is struggling to sleep well or seeking to improve the quality of their sleep, either at night or by taking day-time naps.
