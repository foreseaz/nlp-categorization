    "description": "<p>Our kitchens are a store-house of herbs and spices that greatly improve our health. Do you have basil, oregano, cinnamon, thyme or garlic in your kitchen? Most kitchens are stocked with these valuable and well-known ingredients for health. And they are just a few of the many herbs and spices that we will cover in this course. We will talk about what they are used for and the best ways to use them and how they improve your health.</p>\n\n<p>We often think that spices and herbs are included in recipes for flavor, but actually many of them were initially incorporated into the food we eat for their medicinal and health giving qualities. </p>\n\n<p>Cultures throughout history have effectively treated health illnesses and injuries at home with herbs and spices. They are excellent for preventative, non-emergency and complementary medicine. </p>\n\n<p>All of the herbs and spices in this course have been scientifically shown to be effective and to be very safe. </p>\n\n<p>Using Herbs and spices as medicine is no more difficult than making an easy recipe or even simply steeping a cup of tea. For our own health and healing, we should use them often.</p>\n\n<p> So jump right in to the course to start taking better care of your health today.</p>",
