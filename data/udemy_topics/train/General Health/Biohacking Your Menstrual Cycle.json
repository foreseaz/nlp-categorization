Are you tired of blaming all your moods and aches and pains on your hormones, like it’s out of your control and there is nothing you can do? Can’t understand why you rocked your workout at the gym last week and this week it feels like torture?</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Psst! I’ll let you in on a secret.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Putting up with these things is NOT part of ‘being a woman’.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t This course is designed to educate and empower you to maximize each phase of your menstrual cycle. You will briefly return to highschool health class, but with a twist. You will review the basics of each cycle phase and then learn which foods and what exercise best supports you during each phase. Instead of looking at the negatives of specific phases (e.g., dreading the days before your period), you will learn how to eat, think, exercise, and plan your life activities to maximize your power in each stage. Your will learn practical methods for adjusting your personal environment to support your hormone balance to achieve health and well-being.  </p>",
