This course is perfect for anyone trying to regain their energy due to chronic stress.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn this course we will begin to uncover some reasons for your daytime fatigue.  The first section will address the basics of your body&#039;s energy producing system.  Section 3 addresses some of the daily habits that deplete our adrenals and leave us feeling drained. Knowing a bit about your metabolism and hormones will allow you to better communicate with your physician in searching for the root of your fatigue.  Section 4 stresses the importance of a good healthcare team.  It also offers tips for getting the most out of your next medical visit. Section 5 is full of natural supports to aid in supporting your adrenals to function optimally.  This section also includes the resource list that helped me put this course together.  </p>",
