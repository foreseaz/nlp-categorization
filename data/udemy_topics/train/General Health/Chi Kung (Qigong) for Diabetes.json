    "description": "<p>Andy Wright has put together a nine move set, with all the moves benefiting the condition of diabetes.  He has researched the best of the best and has created this FREE set of qigong exercises based upon the underlying reasons of good Qi flow.  </p><p>Most times the body has good energy flow. When a blockage occurs the real world result is an illness. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms appear the said problem has manifested to such a point that the body's reaction is significant.  </p><p>If people practised Qigong regularly there is possibility that illnesses can be minimised. Once physical signs have begun it is not impossible to recover, it just may take a while longer.  </p><p>Diabetes has many real world causes other than the standard blocked energy which is only an outward  manifestation.  For example, the person's lifestyle choices (e.g. a sugar rich diet with no exercise) CAN contribute to the overall condition the body manifests.</p><p>Qigong is brilliant but it is not a miracle worker.  It is merely a tool to maintaining good health and to prevent and improve your health; HOWEVER you may need to improve other aspects of your life such as increasing exercise (where Qigong can help) and changing the diet (removing toxic additives and sugar / processed products).</p>",
