    "description": "<p><strong>Acupressure is a natural health technique</strong>,\neasily accessible to beginners. \n</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>This free course is an introduction to my other practical courses concerning how to \"Manage various emotions with Acupressure\". So as such it is not a practical course by itself where you learn where are the points for example. But it does include all essential guidelines for your future Acupressure practice.<strong></strong> <br></p><p><strong></strong><strong>In the course,</strong> after a quick introduction about the energy points, <strong>you will understand how to use the synergy of the 3 essential elements of Acupressure</strong>: <strong>Touch, Breathing, Intention. </strong></p><p><strong>You will inderstand why and how they are important if you plan to get any real deep and lasting benefit from your Acupressure practice. </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Because indeed, Acupressure is a great way to improve your daily\nlife and support your desire to change and/or to be relieved from most common physical or emotional disorders. </p><p><strong></strong>Last but not least, Acupressure never adversely affects the course of\nmedical treatment (analgesic, antidepressant, anxiolytic â€¦)\nquite the contrary. </p>",
