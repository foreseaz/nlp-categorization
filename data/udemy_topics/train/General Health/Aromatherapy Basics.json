    "description": "<p>  \t     This is a basic introduction to aromatherapy and the use of essential oils for therapeutic purposes. It&#039;s designed with the absolute beginner in mind.  If you&#039;ve always wondered about aromatherapy, but have never studied it formally (or if it&#039;s been a very long time since you have) then this course is for you!  </p>  <p>  \tThe topics covered are:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>What is Aromatherapy?</li>  \t<li>History of Aromatherapy</li>  \t<li>Current Trends</li>  \t<li>Distillation, Extraction and Storage</li>  \t<li>Safe Use, Cautions and Contraindications</li>  \t<li>Overview of benefits</li>  \t<li>Base Oils and Products</li>  \t<li>Further Study</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t     This aromatherapy course is not affiliated with any products company or multi-level marketing scheme.  It is purely educational.  You do not need to purchase anything to go through this course, although if you already have a few essential oils on hand to sniff and examine during the lectures, that&#039;s great!  </p>  <p>  \t    You should complete this course before moving on to more advanced topics such as blending and aromatherapy treatment design.  This course is more conceptual than a workshop would be.  It will give you the knowledge you need to jumpstart your aromatherapy practice and confidence to begin using essential oils.  </p>",
