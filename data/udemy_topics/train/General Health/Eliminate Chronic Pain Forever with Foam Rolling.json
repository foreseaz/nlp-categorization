When you use a muscle or muscle group frequently, your body breaks down muscle fibers so that they can adapt and grow stronger. </strong></em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    Fascia is the tissue that surrounds our muscle fibers and organs so that they may glide smoothly past each other to reduce friction in the body.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t           An unfortunate and inevitable side effect of frequent muscle use during exercise or other repetitive movements, is the development of <strong>knots, adhesions, and scar tissue </strong>around the fascia. This causes tightness and soreness in the muscle.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t           Using a foam roller and other myofascial release devices properly on the muscles allow you to break down the scar tissue, knots, and adhesions. Regular use of a foam roller and other SMR (self myofascial release) techniques over time will  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em>      -Improve flexibility  </em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em>      -Increase circulation  </em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em>      -Increase kinesthetic awareness  </em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em>      -Reduce injury  </em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em>      -Reduce recovery time between workouts  </em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    Foam rolling is beneficial for anyone who has muscular tightness, stress, knots, or chronic pain ANYWHERE on your body.
