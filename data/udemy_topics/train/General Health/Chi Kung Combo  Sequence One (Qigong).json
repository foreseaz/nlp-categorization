    "description": "<p>the chi kung combination is a simple set of exercises, put together in such a way as to be challenging mentally and physically, yet is much easier than a standard tai chi form.  </p><p>the chi kung combination shown here is the one taught at andy wright's sessions. </p><p>the majority of the moves making up the combination are taken from the various standard chi kung sets.  in particular set one and two of  shibashi, the 18 stance chi kung sets, lend themselves invaluable to the construction of this sequence.</p><p>the chi kung combination teaches the student valuable lessons about tai chi and chi kung principles such as good body alignment and movement, breathing, combining arm and leg movements, smooth transitioning between moves, balance and control plus much more.  </p><p>Additionally the combination's side effect is that it aids with memory functions as a result of practising the sequence.</p><p>The course is shown as a series of videos spanning 1-4 moves and is demonstrated front and side views, plus a slow-motion version. At the end the moves are recapped from the start until the last move shown.</p>",
