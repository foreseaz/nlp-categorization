You feel like your moods and energy levels change each week and you think there’s a pattern every month, but you are wondering if you are just imagining it? </span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   It’s not “all in your head.”  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   There are four phases to your menstrual cycle. It’s not as simple as “ you have your period or you don’t.” Your mood, energy levels and other physiological symptoms change throughout the month. If you could only tune into these changes you could learn to work with them and not be surprised when they happen each month. The more you understand your own body, the better able you are to take control of your own health and happiness.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   And tuning into your body will only take you 5 minutes per day.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Join me for Cycle Track: Tuning Into Your Menstrual Cycle.  </p>",
