It&#039;s thought that a third of people in the UK have episodes of insomnia. It tends to be more common in women and more likely to occur with age.</p><p style=\"\">Causes are varied but can be attributed to stress and anxiety but it can also be caused by conditions such as depression, schizophrenia or asthma, some medications, and alcohol or drug misuse.</p><p style=\"\">This course will teach you some very simple qigong movements that you can do everyday before bedtime that are effective in overcoming the bouts of insomnia.  Practice of the qigong should be done daily and even when not affected by insomnia because qigong works best in the preventative role.</p><p style=\"\">The curriculum is easy to follow, with the main points taught as a video presentation.</p>",
