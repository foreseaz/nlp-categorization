    "description": "<p>This course is for anyone involved in the early rehabilitation after knee injury or surgery. It would also be of value to trainee physiotherapists.</p><p>Because internal joint scarring, if it is going to occur, is likely to trigger early in the rehabilitation process, then it is the patient and the physiotherapist who need to be looking out for the danger signs. If they understand the issues and what to watch for, then  management can be optimised before there is a progression to the tragic outcome of intractable scarring (arthrofibrosis) with irreversible stiffness of the knee. </p><p>The course explains the issues, anatomy and terminology - with loads of easy to follow illustrations and videos - so that your rehabilitation programme will really start to make proper sense. You will learn what the physiotherapist is trying to do, and why. You will learn about those surgical procedures that may be helpful in the process of freeing up movement again.The course should take four hours to complete, but there is no need for any pre-knowledge as it is fully comprehensive.</p><p></p>",
