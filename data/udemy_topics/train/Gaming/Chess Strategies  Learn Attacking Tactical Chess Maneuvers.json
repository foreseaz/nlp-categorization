    "description": "<p><em>This course covers attacking chess motifs such as defence annihilation, decoying, distraction, discovered attack and pursuit. I will demonstrate not only the concept of these tactical chess maneuvers but also the logic behind finding these moves in your own chess games. This course is broken down into 5 sections (one for each motif). In each section you will find 3-4 tutorials analysing different chess puzzles (the difficulty of the positions analysed in these puzzles increases as you go along). Also each section contains an analysis of a game played between two chess grand masters to demonstrate how effective these tactical manoeuvres can be and finally we prepared quizzes for you to practise and the end of each section.</em></p><p><em></em></p>",
