By taking this course you will learn not only the basics to getting started in the game but also the advanced gameplay techniques implemented by top players world wide.  </p>  <p>  \t              The course is made up almost entirely of videos taken in game and shows you exactly what you need to do to improve your WoW experience.  </p>  <p>  \t              I'll also demonstrate many techniques used in game to increase your income (in gold of course!). Learn to play the Auction House and use your Garrison to <strong>maximise gold earnings!  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            Don't be the person that gets booted from dungeons for being a newbie or for consistently having the lowest DPS. Learn to play your character properly, no matter the class or spec!  </p>  <p>  \tDo you find the terminology in WoW confusing? Are there too many acronyms? Never fear! I've got you covered!  </p>  <p>  \t              There is something for everyone, from the newest player to the seasoned veteran.  </p>  <p>  \t              The course doesn't end there though. The World of Warcraft is ever changing and as such, so will this course. I'll be keeping it up to date with all of the latest changes, updates and more tips and tricks.  </p>  <p>  \t              There are resources as well so keep an eye on the Resources tab for useful lists, tables and links!  </p>  <p>  \t          And if you're ever lost or confused, add my battle tag (Ardy#1631) in game and ask me a question!  </p>  <p>  \t    As with all of my courses there's no risk with Udemy's 30-day refund policy!  </p>  <p>  \t              Give the course a go. <strong>For Azeroth!  </strong>  </p>",
