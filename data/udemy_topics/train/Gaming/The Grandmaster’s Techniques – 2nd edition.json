Finding a GOOD chess coach is also a huge problem. During my chess career as a player and as a coach, I have thought about an effective way of learning all the time.</p><p>That’s why I decided to develop a complete chess course, Introducing our top selling chess course “The Grandmaster’s secrets”. With pride I can say that this course will give you only the concrete skills.</p>",
