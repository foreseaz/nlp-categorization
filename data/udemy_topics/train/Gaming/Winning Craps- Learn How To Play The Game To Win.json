    "description": "<p>Every year, millions of people walk into a casino or play online.  Often, no-one has EVER taught them which game to play, how to play it, in order to get the best shot for their investment. Really, that's what your initial bankroll is, an investment, and this course will show you how to make the most of it, and not get taken for a sucker by the casinos.<br></p><p>The game of craps is a useful skill to have as well as a great metaphor for life.  The dice roll for a time, and by having skill and knowledge of the game, knowing what bets are good vs. bad, knowing how to manage your money and taking advantage of Lady Luck when she shows, you can have a very fun time and pull something meaningful off the table, in this case, more chips (cash money) than you risked in the first place.  The play is always balanced on a knife edge, just like life, and in that moment from the start of the roll to the end, we do our best to pull as much sweetness and meaning off the table that we can. </p><p>This course will teach you how to play and understand the underlying pattern of craps.  And when a seven is rolled and the game ends, you leave willingly as you will likely, given the mastery of this material and applying it over time, leave with more money than you came with to the table.  </p>",
