    "description": "<p>  \tIn this first series of lessons on Sprite Kit based role playing games, we will create a physics-based world with a roaming hero that can collide with other heroes (and make them follow the leader). Nearly everything will be property-list driven (adjustable by changing text in a plist file) and we&#039;ll program options for each character to include / exclude front view animation, side view animation or back view animation. We will look at making the character attack, emit particles, receive damage, have a health meter, advance levels, restart levels and much, much more! All using Xcode 5 and Sprite Kit.  </p>",
