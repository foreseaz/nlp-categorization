No current betting system like Martingale, Reverse Martingale, Labouchere, D'alambert or following patterns can succeed in the long run because every bet gives you a negative expectation of 2.7%. So what secret can help you win the most and lose the least by playing this game?</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Cascade Of Losses</strong></p>\n\n<p>After being in casinos for over 10 years and having played Poker extensively all around the world, I would take shots at Roulette following my own unique system that I will share with you. I was much dismayed when a friend told me he had already lost nearly a million US dollars by playing Roulette and I began to help him teach my system, and the same system I taught him I will teach all of you. It is a game against the casinos and I have nothing to lose by giving my winning secret to you. </p>\n\n<p><strong> The Power Of Intuition</strong></p>\n\n<p>The power of intuition is behind several great people who have amassed great wealth and it is something that I will use in and what this course takes from. Intuition is one of the most unused faculties of human beings in the modern age, but people like Steve Jobs have recognized it and acknowledged the importance of it. </p>\n\n<p>Only Intuition can help you win or be break-even in the long run while playing Roulette, a solid betting strategy that I convey to you will let you keep winnings, prevent losses, and teach you how to cut losses, and how to pyramid wins. </p>",
