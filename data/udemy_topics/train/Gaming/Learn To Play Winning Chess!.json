    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What is this course </strong><strong style=\"\">about? <br style=\"\">  \t</strong>This is a complete guide to understanding and playing the game of chess; from the correct way to set up the board through to tactical ideas and the various ways to win the game.<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">How is the course delivered?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t      After the introduction video there are eight instruction videos followed by a course review video. These are in the form of slide presentations with &#039;voice-over&#039; coaching. Each of the instruction videos is accompanied by a self-test question paper, an answer sheet and a key points summary sheet so that you can check your understanding along the way and have a &#039;hard copy&#039; of the main learning points.<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">How long will the course take to complete?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t      The course is presented in &#039;bite-sized&#039; pieces, each video lasting between five and ten minutes. The total video time is 70 minutes but you&#039;ll also be completing self-test question papers each containing ten questions, you&#039;ll be checking your answers against the provided answer sheets and reading the key points summary sheets. If you covered all of that in the one sitting it would take around two and a half hours.<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Why take this course?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t      You&#039;ll want to take this course if you want to learn how to play what is unquestionably the best board game ever devised. This course will give you an accurate and solid grounding in all the rules and general principles of sound play and you&#039;ll find that, although becoming a very strong chess player can take years, learning how to play is easy.<br style=\"\">  \t      Learning to play chess is like finding a new friend - one who&#039;s always there for you and who will give you a lifetime of pleasure. <br style=\"\">  \t      &#039;Chess, like love, is infectious at any age.&#039; Salo Flohr - Soviet International Chess Master  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;Learn to play winning chess! - Introduction&#039;</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      A sincere welcome and an overview of the course content.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;</strong><strong style=\"\">How to correctly set up the board and the chess pieces ...&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The correct way to set up the board and the pieces at the start of the game.</li>  \t<li>The object of the game and the importance of King safety.</li>  \t<li>How to record chess games -and why it&#039;s so useful.</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz.</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary sheet</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;The Major Pieces&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The power of the Queen and the vital importance of the King.</li>  \t<li>&#039;Check&#039; and the priority of escaping from it.</li>  \t<li>The three ways of escaping from it. </li>  \t<li>The Rook and how it moves</li>  \t<li>King and Queen checkmating a lone King </li>  \t<li>Double Rook checkmate</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz.</li>  \t<li>Answer Sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;The Minor Pieces&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Bishops and Knights - Their strengths and limitations</li>  \t<li>&#039;Smothered Mate&#039;.</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz</li>  \t<li>Answer Sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;The Power of the Pawns&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The common misconception of their lowly status.</li>  \t<li>How Pawns move - including their initial move and how they capture.</li>  \t<li>Pawn formations - strengths and weaknesses</li>  \t<li>Pawn promotion.</li>  \t<li>Pawns in attack and defence.</li>  \t<li>The en passant capture.</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz.</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;Protecting Your King&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The purpose of castling.</li>  \t<li>When castling is not allowed.</li>  \t<li>The relative values of the pieces</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz.</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;Delivering Checkmate!&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\"></strong>Various checkmates in different phases of the game</li>  \t<li>&#039;Pawn storm&#039; mates</li>  \t<li>Back rank mate</li>  \t<li>Stalemate</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz.</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;How To Play The Opening&#039;<br style=\"\">  \t </strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The three aims of the opening phase</li>  \t<li>The Italian Opening example</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has It Stuck?&#039; quiz</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  \t<li>Key Points Summary</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;Win Your Games Using These Tactical Themes&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Various examples of material winning tactics e.g. Forks, Pins and Skewers</li>  \t<li>Discovered Attacks, Discovered Checks and Double Checks</li>  \t<li>&#039;Has it Stuck?&#039; quiz (using positions from actual games).</li>  \t<li>Answer sheet</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">In the video &#039;Course Review&#039;</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Congratulations!</li>  \t<li>Review and consolidation of all areas covered.</li>  \t<li>Recommendations for future improvement</li>  </ul>",
