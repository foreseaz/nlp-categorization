    "description": "<p>This course covers tricky chess motifs such as <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Stalemate, Material Restriction, Pawn Promotion, Intermediate Move, Tempo Gain</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Destroying Pawn Cover.</strong> I will demonstrate not only the concept of these tactical chess maneuvers but also the logic behind finding these moves in your own chess games. </p>\n\n<p>This course is broken down into 6 sections (one for each motif). In each section you will find 3-4 tutorials analyzing different chess puzzles (the difficulty of the positions analyzed in these puzzles increases as you go along). Also each section contains an analysis of a game played between two chess grand masters to demonstrate how effective these tactical manoeuvres can be. In the last section I teach you how <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">to combine a few tactical motifs</strong> in one line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally I prepared <strong>quizzes</strong> for you to practice at the end of each section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this course you also get:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs</strong></li><li>all future additional lectures, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">game examples</strong></li><li>never any questions asked <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Viktor</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
