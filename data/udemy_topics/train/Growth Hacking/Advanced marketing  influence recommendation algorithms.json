But what people don't realize is that you can potentially get much more traffic from recommendation algorithms than from SEO.</p><p>In this course I teach you how to get the most out of recommendation algorithms, and how to make sure that your product is shown next to some of the other top products. When that happens, you get a flood of buyers of your products who come from browsing the other popular products. </p><p>And what you want to have happen is for your product to show up on the recommended list of many other products on sites like Amazon, YouTube and even Udemy. That is when you make significant money on these platforms.</p><p>So go ahead, enroll in the course, and let me open your eyes to the possibilities in the world of recommendation algorithms!</p>",
