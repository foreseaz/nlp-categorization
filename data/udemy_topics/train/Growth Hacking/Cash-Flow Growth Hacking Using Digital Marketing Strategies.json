This is important beca<span>use it will give you the peace of mind of having cash coming in - to cover your daily expenses - so you can concentrate on growing your business.</span></p>  <p>Whether you're an entrepreneur, a professional, an existing business owner or simply thinking on starting a new business, you are forced to grapple with an every-increasing amount of competition and technology transformation.  In fact, according to the SBA 2/3 of US businesses quietly cease to exist before they reach 10 years of existence.  This means that most small businesses generate cash-flow for an owner and his or her family for some period of years and then quietly close. </p><p>This course is part of the Millionaire’s Roadmap series.  Even though I created a Roadmap to make it easier for everyone to get\n from $0 to $1M  ... YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ROADMAP. <strong> Each course stands on its own and covers in depth one single topic in the HUGE process of building a business</strong>.   Therefore <strong>if you are interested in cash-flow only</strong>, then this course is for you.  <strong>YOU DO NOT NEED OR HAVE TO TAKE ANY OF THE OTHER COURSES.</strong><br></p>  <p><strong>Anyone can build a successful business </strong></p>  <p>This course is about improving your chances of building a profitable and successful business <em>faster and effectively</em>.  We go far beyond the kinds of \"growth hacking\" (or “<em>how to</em>” gurus) you may have been exposed to, by diving into an <em>actual real live case study </em>that shows in real time the progress of going from absolutely $0 to $1M.  This course works as a) a summary of those steps taken and b) you get the step-by-step growth hacking traction channels used to generate cash-flow in less than 1 month (with worksheets and everything needed to get you stated) </p>  <p>In the Millionaire’s Roadmap series, you'll learn how to bring your initial cash-flow; massively grow your customer acquisition; run ads as close to zero cost to you as possible; upsell, down-sells, cross-sells and increase customer value in a whole new way - a faster, better way. </p><p>+++ This course takes care of the first and probably most important step…<strong>cash-flow first</strong>.+++</p><p><br></p>\n<p><strong>How I'll teach you to growth hack your business from $0 to $1M </strong></p>  <p>The sad irony is that in order to build a successful business in the past, you had to have lots of money, borrow heavily or have access to investors.  Or, you had to invest hundreds of dollars and hours attending an MBA program to understand all the moving parts of running a business, or wing it trying to figure out how to make your business successful.  I spent 18 years of my life doing exactly that. </p>  <p>Fortunately, I already made all the mistakes.  I have two master’s degrees, one in Business and one in Finance.  I have built a business from scratch.  That is correct, I started my first business from my bedroom.  My kitchen table was my \"<em>telemarketing </em><em>department</em>” and my closet was my “<em>support department</em>.”  I grew this business to be the top 10 in the country in my industry.  I used it as my guinea pig to see what worked and what didn’t ... and boy, do I have the scars to show you what didn’t work!</p>  <p>I've designed a course based heavily on a real business I am building as we speak. One thing I noticed about “<em>gurus</em>” is that they all show you the “<em>how</em>” but none of them show you a live case study.  Anyone can teach you the how, all you have to do is read a couple of books and regurgitate the information.  Showing you the “<em>how</em>” <strong>LIVE </strong>is an entirely different story.  You see the good, the bad and the ugly.  You learn how to iterate or pivot.  You have something to emulate without taking massive risks or trying to figure out the next steps on your own. </p>  <p>This 5-section course series does not contain any flashy graphics or fancy videos.  It shows simple screenshots or screencasts of the case study as we progress; presented in video-lectures and a great deal of worksheets and exercises.  The course will require that you implement and follow through with each course in the Millionaire’s Series if you want to build a million dollar business.  It won't be easy - but if you put in the work, you will massively increase your chances of success. </p>  <p>In addition to the lectures, there is an additional 4-set sales funnel, worth over $1,000 each.  You can access them from the bonus section.  These are ready to be implemented for complete holiday sales campaigns. All you have to do is tweak the text, links and images/videos and you are good to go.  In future courses, I will teach you how to run these sales campaigns.</p>  <p><em>\"Millionaire’s Roadmap\" is a trademark of Jackie Burgoa.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Every minute you delay is actually COSTING your business money....</strong><strong><br> <br> <strong>Enroll now!</strong></strong></p>",
