In this course, I’ll take you through every step and help you work your way up to the top of the pyramid.</p>  <p>\t<strong>Get paid hundreds of dollars for a single blog post that you can write from anywhere in the world.</strong>  </p>  <ul>\t<li>Learn what freelance blogging is all about and why businesses will pay you to write blog posts for them.</li>\t<li>Find your niche as a blogger and set up your portfolio website.</li>\t<li>Learn how to find work as a freelance blogger and work your way up from unpaid to highly paid.</li>\t<li>Attract the best companies in your niche</li>\t<li>Learn how to continuously increase prices to $200, $300, $400, or even more, for a single post.</li>  </ul>  <p>\t<strong>A new career and a rich, location-independent life awaits you.</strong>  </p>  <p>\t There's a revolution happening in the marketing world, and content marketing, the form of marketing where businesses attract customers with content, is fast becoming the most popular form of marketing. Every day, more companies are starting blogs to produce interesting content that will bring them readers, subscribers, and, ultimately, customers.</p>  <p>\t In fact, businesses spend 30% of their marketing budget on producing blog content. Where does that money go? To the people who create that content - Freelance Bloggers!</p>  <p>\t The best part is, there are more businesses requiring awesome content than there are freelance bloggers. That means the demand is more than the supply, so there's a huge opportunity for you to take advantage of it.</p>  <p>\t<strong>Content and overview</strong>  </p>  <p>\t Looking to boost your income with a side job that you can do from home? Or maybe you want to quit your job and switch to something that gives you more free time and flexibility? Perhaps you want to travel the world and work from beaches.</p>  <p>\t Whatever it is, freelance blogging is the best way to do it.</p>  <p>\t This course will show you, step-by-step, how to go from having no experience to getting paid premium rates as a freelance blogger. This is the exact journey I followed, starting from low rates, $30 to $40 a post, and making my way up over weeks and months, to hundreds of dollars per post.</p>  <p>\t Many freelance bloggers get stuck right at the start, earning only $30 a post. They have to write hundreds of posts each month to make a decent living. And then they complain online about how businesses don't pay enough and that freelance blogging is tough. This in turn scares away other new freelance bloggers.</p>  <p>\t Well, in this course I'll show you how to break out of that. I'll start you off by creating a foundation for you. These basics are important, and something that most bloggers miss.</p>  <p>\t Once you have that covered, we'll move on to some actual writing. I'm not going to teach you grammar, sentence structure or how to write. I will teach you how to construct a good blog post, and get you in the habit of writing posts for business blogs.</p>  <p>\t Then, we get to the fun part. You'll start earning some actual money. I'll show you how I started and, if you want some quick and easy cash, you can also start with earning $30-$40 a post.</p>  <p>\t But it's important not to get stuck there like everyone else. I'll quickly show you how to move up the ladder, entering a medium income level, and earning anywhere between $50 to $200 per post.</p>  <p>\t I'll give you all the tools you need to get your way up to $200 per post, including lists of blogs that pay well, and word-for-word scripts and templates I use to pitch to businesses and offer my services as a blogger.</p>  <p>\t It might take you weeks, even months, to get to the stage where you're earning $200 per post but, when you get there, you'll join the ranks of premium bloggers like me. After that, I'll show you how to go higher. I'll help you find the blogs that are willing to pay $300, $400, and more per post, and I'll teach you how to price yourself to earn more and more.</p>  <p>\t By the end of the course, your journey will only be just beginning. As a premium freelance blogger, there are a number of new career paths open to you. You could keep traveling the world, earning thousands of dollars a month writing from anywhere, or you could join a company as a content marketer, like I did. The choice is yours, and I'll show you what options you have.</p>  <p>\t Now, this course is not meant to be finished in one sitting, or one day, or one week, or even one month. It's long, with 46 lectures and hours of video content, along with worksheets and assignments. But, I guarantee you, you'll be earning money within the first few weeks if you do it right.</p>  <p>\t I'm so confident about that, that I will return the money you paid for this course if you haven't already earned it from freelance blogging within the first 60 days.</p>  <p>\t So, the only question is, are you ready to start a new journey in your life? It doesn't matter how old you are, where you're from, whether you have a degree or what you do professionally. I guarantee that ANYONE can benefit from this course as long as they are willing to put in the time and effort.</p>  <p>\t There is no better time to become a freelance blogger than now. Your road to financial freedom is only a click away, so start now and don't look back!</p>",
