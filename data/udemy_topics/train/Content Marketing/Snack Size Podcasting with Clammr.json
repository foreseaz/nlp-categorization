    "description": "<p>The benefits of audio podcasting are endless - audio content is portable, convenient, easy to create and consume. The personal nature of audio will help you build an ongoing, engaged following as listeners get to know you through your voice. And over time they will become your best prospects for deepening the social engagement through cross-promotion and loyalty.</p><p>There are two big challenges with audio content. One is shareability. Unlike a photo or a quick 140 character blurb, there just haven&#039;t been many platforms that allow you to easily share and receive high converting audio that will drive followers to your products or services.</p><p>The second challenge is time. As with any media these days, you are competing in a very crowded marketplace for the time and attention of your audience. Your audio strategy must use the best and most viral platforms to get noticed.</p><p>Clammr is an excellent platform for solving both issues - helping you engage and drive social traffic using the power of snack size sound bites in 18 seconds or less. This course will teach you how to get started using this unique platform to enhance your branding and grow your social following.</p>",
