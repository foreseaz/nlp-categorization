I even got interesting job offers because of my blog.  </p>  <p>  \t  It&#039;s gotten to the point that I&#039;ve stopped applying to jobs, because the opportunities just come to me!  </p>  <p>  \t  So now, whenever I speak to young promising entrepreneurs, I always tell them to blog now. Because, I wouldn&#039;t be here without my blog.  </p>  <p>  \t  Now I want to show you all the tips, tricks and know-how on how I got my blog from 0 readers to 10,000 per month. It took me 3 years to get here. But, with my course, you can do it sooner.  </p>",
