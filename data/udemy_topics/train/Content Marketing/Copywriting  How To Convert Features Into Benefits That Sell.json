I work as a <strong>Marketing </strong>Manager, I teach very successful courses on <strong>Marketing Fundamentals </strong>and <strong>Marketing Psychology </strong>and <strong>Copywriting</strong>. I’ve created and launched over 20 digital products. I also teach over 10 000 students from 128 countries. </p>  <p>So much for me, let’s see what you are going to learn:</p>  <p>In this class you will learn <strong>copywriting</strong> which is one of the most<em><strong> important elements of effective marketing</strong>.</em> The art of copywriting involves strategically delivering words that get people to take a specific action that you want. It might be a sale, registration for a webinar, opt in in your email list and more. </p>  <p><strong>Copywriting </strong>is a broad subject and if you want to learn everything at once, it might be a bit overwhelming. For that reason I’ve started creating classes which address separate parts of that subject. This approach is successful, because you master copywriting one step at a time until you transform yourself into a world-class copywriter. </p>  <p>In the first class on copywriting, I teach how to write extremely powerful, attention-grabbing headlines. And this is the second class and here you will learn <strong>how to write irresistible benefits that sell. </strong></p>  <ul><li>First of all the <strong>crucial difference </strong>between <strong>features </strong>and <strong>benefits</strong>! Even advanced marketers have hard time explaining which one is which and….</li><li>Secondly, you will learn how to convert cold features into <strong>powerful and emotional benefits which sell. </strong></li><li>Next, you will learn how to <strong>identify </strong>the benefits of the benefit. Or how to dig deeper into <strong>the prospects mind</strong> and find what makes them tick. </li><li>You will learn what I call the <strong>Holy Grail</strong> in marketing – <strong>The Ladder Of Abstraction</strong>. Mastering the principles from that lecture will <strong>instantly </strong>improve your communication skills and you will be able to create irresistible marketing messages. </li><li>Next, you will learn the <strong>best place </strong>to write the benefits of your product. And how to do it exactly by using a <strong>specific formula</strong> plus a<strong> real-life example</strong>. </li><li>You will learn the top <strong>3 trigger words</strong> that you should always imply in your marketing message. </li><li>You will learn simple but <strong>effective 3-step framework</strong> for writing marketing copy. </li><li>You will learn the <strong>single most important factor for pricing</strong> your product or service. (And avoid a common pricing mistake)</li><li>You’ll gain access to <strong>valuable resources</strong> for copywriting and marketing. Make sure you download the <strong>PDF </strong>files. </li><li>And much, much more…</li></ul>                    <p>I explain every concept by providing you with great, world-class examples of the most successful copywriters in the world. So, you will be learning about proven strategies. Not vague theories. </p>  <p><strong>Just for a second imagine</strong> what it would be to have the skill of writing amazing marketing copy that sells. <strong>This very skill may skyrocket your sales by 2 or 5 or 10 times. </strong></p>  <p>And why exactly you should be concerned with benefits? Glad you asked. Because <strong>features tell, but benefits sell.</strong></p>  <p>Even if you have the best product in the world if you don’t know how to market it, it won’t be successful. You need to have copywriting skills to make it happen. </p>  <p><strong>This course is ideal for:</strong></p>  <ul><li>Bloggers</li><li>Book authors</li><li>Online entrepreneurs</li><li>Online marketers</li><li>And people from any occupation that requires writing marketing copy for the purpose of getting response and action.</li></ul>          <p>… but I want to make something clear… when I say bloggers I don’t mean I will be teaching you how to write blog posts… I will be teaching you how to write pieces of marketing copy that sells. </p>      <p>I will provide you with all the knowledge I have and all the resources I use to transform you into a world-class copywriter. </p>I invite you to join us and develop your copywriting skills to sell more of your products almost overnight.   <p>Click the “<strong>Take This Course</strong>” button,</p>  <p>I’m waiting for you inside the course!</p>",
