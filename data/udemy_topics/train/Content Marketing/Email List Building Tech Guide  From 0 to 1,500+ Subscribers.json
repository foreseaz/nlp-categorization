LEARN HOW TO HANDLE THE TECH SIDE OF BUILDING YOUR EMAIL LIST FAST.  \t</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>LATEST: Course Fully Updated For June 2016</em><strong></strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t        In this course, I'll be teaching you the exact methods that I used to build my email list from 0 to over 1,500 subscribers in less than 18 months.  \t  <strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is my experience on the topic?</strong>  \t          I've been a content marketer for over three years through blogging and podcasting. I'm completely self taught (hundreds of hours of trial and error). From my online platform, I've built my own independent online business from scratch (from $0 to over $40,000 in revenue).  \t <strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong>  \t          This course is for someone who already has a website and is looking to invest in building their email list.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What problems does this course solve?</strong>  \t          It saves you hundreds of hours of trial and error in building your email list. It gives you the exact blueprint (and I mean EXACT) for using AWeber and LeadPages together to build your email list as fast as possible.  \t  <strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this course NOT for?</strong>  \t          This course is NOT for people not willing to invest in both AWeber and LeadPages to build their email list.  </p>",
