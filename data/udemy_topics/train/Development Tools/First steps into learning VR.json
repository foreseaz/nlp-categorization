I'm going to assume you have no previous knowledge with any of the applications or concepts and I will walk you through all the steps in creating your first VR scene that you can load onto your mobile device.</p><p>When you've completed the course you'll have the basic knowledge of how to set up a VR camera, create a user interface, setup 3D spatial sound and add basic events that will allow the end user to interact with the completed scene.</p><p>This course is not designed to show you how to make a game but rather an explanation of the components required to create a basic VR experience. This general purpose knowledge will allow you to expand your VR training to include other platforms such as the Oculus Rift or web based virtual reality.</p>",
