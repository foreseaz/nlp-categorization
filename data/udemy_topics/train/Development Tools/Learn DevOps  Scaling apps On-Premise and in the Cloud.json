The average salary in the US is <strong>$105,000 per year</strong> (source: Glassdoor), up to an <strong>average of $146,000 in San Fransisco</strong> (source: Indeed).</p>\n\n<p>The course is <strong>aimed at software engineers, database and system administrators</strong> that want to deliver software that is scalable, reliable, available, manageable and still cost effective.
