    "description": "<p>  \t   This is a course for busy faculty members or business owners who need to communicate with employees or faculty who work in off-site locations.  It demonstrates rapid and efficient means of organizing files, creating a mind-map presentation which can be used through the series, and screen-casting to tie the material together.  This will emphasize both the &quot;big picture&quot; and the necessary details.  Basic information about saving the files and where to host the videos to allow your learners access will finish up the class.  </p>  <p>  \t   This is not a detailed course examining every option within each software package, as there are several excellent Udemy classes which already accomplish this task.  Rather, take this course to learn the key details in less than two hours.  You can hone your skills over time.  </p>  <p>  \t   Videos, sample mindmaps, and assignments represent the course materials.  Bring your own project and work through it so that you will have a meaningful product by the time you finish the course.  </p>",
