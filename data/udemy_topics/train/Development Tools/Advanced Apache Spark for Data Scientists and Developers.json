    "description": "<p>Apache Spark is an open source data processing engine. Spark is designed to provide fast processing of large datasets, and high performance for a wide range of analytics applications. Unlike MapReduce, Spark enables in-memory cluster computing which greatly improves the speed of iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tasks.    </p><p>Adastra Academy’s Advanced Apache Spark includes illuminating video lectures, thorough application examples, a guide to install the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment, and quizzes. Through this course, you will learn about Spark’s four built-in libraries - SparkStreaming, DataFrames (SparkSQL), MLlib and GraphX - and how to develop, build, tune, and debug Spark applications. The course exercises will enable you to become proficient at creating fully functional real-world applications using the Apache Spark libraries. Unlike other courses, we give you the guided and ground-up approach to learning Spark that you need in order to become an expert.</p>",
