    "description": "<p>Welcome and congratulations on your desire to learn how to make your very own homemade wine that you will be proud to serve to friends and family! Throughout the course I will teach you basic wine making terms, the supplies you will need, how it all works and how to make wine following easy step-by-step directions.  I have made sweet red, dry red, and port wine from juice and from grapes. We will focus primarily on making wine from grape juice that you can buy from a wine supply store. This is a fun hobby that allows you to experiment and make a totally custom wine. Your excitement will grow from year-to-year as you make different types of wine that you love. I hope you start a new tradition that will stay in your family for years to come, just as I make wine every year with my family. After this experience you may even want to try making wine from grapes!</p>",
