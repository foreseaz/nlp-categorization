    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this second I Brew - U Brew course series, I draw from my 13 years of brewing experience, in order to teach you deliberate and time conscious methods of how to make 5 gallons of all-grain beer, while utilizing DIY techniques in a very tiny brewing space. Forget everything you know, as you witness alternative mashing, fermenting, bottling and kegging techniques. I&#039;ll also show you efficient and time-saving strategies, while completely eliminating the need for a mash tun, all the while turn up the heat on the Brew in a Bag method.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Bachelorism is more than a marital status, its a way of brewing. Deliberate, repurposed, ambitious, thirsty and resourceful - there is a little bit of bachelor in all of us!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      By purchasing &quot;I Brew - U Brew: Brew like a Bachelor,&quot; you&#039;ll have an unlimited access to videos, PDFs, screencasts and illustrations.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      After completing this course, you&#039;ll be a confident single batch (5 gallons) Brew in a Bag  brewer. This will help you transition seamlessly into a double batch (10 gallons) mash tun-focused brewing system, which is illustrated in my other course &quot;I Brew - U Brew: small spaces, minimal gear, lotsa beer.&quot;  </p>",
