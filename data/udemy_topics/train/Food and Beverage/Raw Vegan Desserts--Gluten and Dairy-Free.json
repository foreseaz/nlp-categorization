Plus, I’m not partial to spending hours baking or attending to pans on a hot stove. So, I went on a mission to create healthier, easy-to-prepare, and just-as-delicious versions of all the great desserts and treats. My results were amazing, and in this class, I’ll share them with you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t You’ll learn how you can stay vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or just plain health-conscious and still eat delicious cakes, pies, ice creams, cookies, candies, and more!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t You’ll be amazed how easy it is to indulge in decadent delights while avoiding white sugar, white flour, dairy products, trans-fats, saturated fats, and processed ingredients. You’ll also love how simple, fast, and affordable all my recipes are. Oh, and I mentioned delicious, right?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t If you want to enjoy desserts for every occasion without spending a lot of time in the kitchen or harming your body, this is the course for you!  </p>",
