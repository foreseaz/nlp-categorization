    "description": "<p>  \t                            Take a look in any home brewing catalogue and you&#039;d likely feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of trinkets available for purchase.  Doesn&#039;t that seem kind of strange given the fact that beer has a 7,000 year history?  </p>  <p>  \t                            I&#039;ve brewed in barns, houses, 125sq/ft apartments, a commercial brewery and with electricity, propane and even over firewood.  This course is the summation of my 12 years of brewing and experience.  The longer I brew the more I keep coming back to simple, DIY brewing.  Over this course, I will walk you through 3 different brewing rigs and their many potential variations.   In addition, I will give you a tour of 6 different kegerator configurations and help you find an equipment build that fits your brewing needs without crushing your homebrew budget.  Come with me on 2 actual step-by-step brews on 2 different systems: a 50 dollar brew-in-a-bag system and my super efficient 10 gallon/4.5 sq. ft vertical system.  <br>  \t<br>  \t                          This course includes videos, illustrations, PDFs and pictures and access to I brew-U brew&#039;s discussion group.  </p>",
