Self-trained chocolatier Rob Kingsbury embraced his Vermont maple sugar roots and inherited his love of confection making from his grandparents. Starting with his family&#039;s recipes, Rob tweaked them with finer imported chocolate and novel ingredients. Today his maple popcorn crunch drizzled in chocolate is a daily thank you to his grandparents love of family and sweets â€” who sold their original maple popcorn at a roadside stand. Today&#039;s chocolates and confections showcase Kingsbury&#039;s sophisticated whimsy.</p><p style=\"\">This course will share with you some of Robert&#039;s chocolate heritage and will be sure to impress your friends and family with these amazing <strong style=\"\">chocolate truffles</strong>.</p>",
