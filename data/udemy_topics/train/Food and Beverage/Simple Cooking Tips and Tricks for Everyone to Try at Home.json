I love all of the different ideas, tips, tricks that are helpful to me in the kitchen. They save <strong>me time, money, and aggravation</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t\t\t\t\t      Imagine a much more <strong>enjoyable </strong>time in the kitchen as you cook. Whether you love, hate, or tired cooking; this course is for you. The title says it all and it is all for your benefit. <strong>Simple Cooking Tips and Trick for Everyone to Try at Home</strong> is exactly what you will be learning about. These tips and tricks have been beneficial to me and I want nothing more than to pass them along to you.  \t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Not only will these tips and tricks save you time and possibly money, it will give you the confidence you need to go into the kitchen. For some of us, we live in kitchen all day cooking. <strong>Wouldn't it be refreshing to learn on a little tip or two? </strong>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      Being honest, I am not a chef or a trained professional. I am just a woman with a passion for food and who wants to share it with everyone else. These tips and tricks I use all the time and they work. Some of these I have heard of before I experimented with them. Some of these I found out all on my own. In the course, not only will I explain the tricks, I will also explain how I got to that point on finding the trick. This course is meant to share a passion within myself, it is also <strong>meant to spark up something in yourself to find the best way to cook in the kitchen. </strong>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      WHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      This is not a video of me cooking in front on the camera  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>You do see and hear me, but I explain my experience and what you need to do to achieve it.
