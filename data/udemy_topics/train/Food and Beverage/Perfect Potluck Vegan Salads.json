    "description": "<p>Whether you are already vegan, interested in what vegans eat or just want some new salad recipes, this course is for you. Vegans get the bad rap of eating \"rabbit food.\" This course will show you how to transform vegetables into delicious salads that are good enough to take to a potluck or cookout. There are a few salads that have greens as the base, but many of the recipes feature the beans, grains and pasta that make a heartier salad. </p><p>You may be thinking, \"Aren't all salads vegan?\" Actually, no they aren't--especially when they are made with traditional ingredients. Salads like caesar salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad fall in this category. I've created vegan versions of these salads in this course. I've also created a dressing/dip that is a great ranch dressing substitute.</p><p>If you're curious, don't hesitate to enroll in this course and learn how to make these delicious, satisfying salads!</p>",
