    "description": "<p>This wine course is divided in 6 sections (Please check the course curriculum) so that you can understand wine better in order to enjoy it better. In this course, I want you to understand why this or that happens and not just to apply theory. Therefore, notes are made available in a PDF format for you to read or to ask further questions so that we can talk even more in depth as regards to a particular topic.</p><p><br>The purpose of this course is for you to build strong wine basis which will allow you to make sense to what is happening when tasting or pairing wine. This course starts at the very beginning of the grape growth cycle, talk in-depth about different wine making methods and tackles some very technical topics such as “Terroir”, wine grape varieties, vintage, climate and much more. The main reason why I decided to make that course this complete is that I do not believe it is possible to pair or taste wine if you do not understand why or what happen before the wine is bottled. </p>",
