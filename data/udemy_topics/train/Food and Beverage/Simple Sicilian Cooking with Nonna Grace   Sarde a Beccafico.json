This course is for those who have fun in the kitchen, love Italian food, and enjoy diving deeper into learning traditional dishes in simple, new and engaging ways.

This dish is a great way to try them for the first time--it's so tasty, it'll convert you.  </p><p>What makes this different than an ordinary cooking course is that you will also learn about the history of the dish, about its birthplace, the Italian island of Sicily and the Sicilian city of Bagheria where the dish was prepared and cooked specifically for this course.  Also  throughout the lessons, you will learn Italian and Sicilian words and phrases.  The course is visual, informative and hands on--The best way to learn is to watch and do as Nonna Grace does. </p>",
