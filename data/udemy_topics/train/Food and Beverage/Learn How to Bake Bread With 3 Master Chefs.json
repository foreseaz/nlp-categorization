Quick bread, made with baking soda instead of yeast </p><p>2. Biscuit dough, using a technique borrowed from croissant making</p><p>3. Dinner rolls, made with yeast</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You'll get the recipes, of course—but you'll also learn how to:</strong><br></p><p>1. Laminate, or fold, dough in order to create exceptionally flaky layers</p><p>2. Activate yeast, including the ideal water temperature for letting it bloom</p><p>3. Mix wet and dry ingredients together </p><p>4. Proof dough and let it rise, without developing a dry crust on top </p><p>5. Make bread ahead of time and freeze for later</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">And most importantly, you can rest assured you're learning from three of the very best chefs to ever wield a rolling pin:</strong></p><p><em><em>Nancy Silverton</em></em> is the founder of La Brea Bakery, which now ships breads around the world, as well as the chef/owner of Osteria Mozza, Pizzeria Mozza and Mozza to Go in Los Angeles. Once, on an episode of <em>Baking with Julia</em>, she baked a brioche tart so good, it made Julia Child cry.</p><p><em>Hugh Acheson </em>is a judge on <em>Top Chef </em>and the owner of numerous restaurants across Georgia. </p><p><em>Sean Brock </em>was named Best Chef in the Southeast by the James Beard Foundation. He is the chef/owner of Husk in Charleston and at partner at McCrady's, as well as a notable advocate of the South's culinary heritage. </p>",
