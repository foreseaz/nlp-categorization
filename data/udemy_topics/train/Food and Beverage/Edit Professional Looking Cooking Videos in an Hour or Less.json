    "description": "<p>  \t      If you&#039;re making cooking videos, editing may take you hours and hours. Or, you maybe so intimidated by the idea of editing, that you refuse to do it. This course picks up where my last course &quot;How to Make Professional Looking Cooking Videos&quot; ends. I show you how I edit my cooking videos from start to finish and also spend time showing you how I create several assets that are part of my videos&#039; branding, like my animated logo and end cards. I show you the best places to find the perfect music and fonts for your videos. Armed with the knowledge from &quot;How to Make Professional Looking Cooking Videos&quot; and a step by step walk through of editing, you&#039;ll be uploading cooking videos to YouTube that will make you proud and delight your viewers.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Special Note:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    I will be using a Mac in the tutorials. However, if you have a PC, you should still benefit from learning the process which you can apply to the software you have.  </p>",
