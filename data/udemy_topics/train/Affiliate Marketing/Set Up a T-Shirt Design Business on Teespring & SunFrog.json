They are worn under clothing, as a fashion statement, and to replace pajamas.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one essential piece of clothing that everyone has in their closet no matter who they are. Whether a multimillionaire, a psychiatrist or a mechanic. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone owns at least one T-shirt T-shirts were made popular as everyday garments by returning GIs from World War II, but they gained extreme popularity in the Hollywood of the 1950s because actors like James Dean started wearing them on screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the popularity of the T-shirt exploded and over the next few decades, a T-shirt became a means of self-expression advertising a person’s favorite bands, political affiliations or product brands and the popularity of the T-shirt in its myriad of colors and designs shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you’re still <u>struggling to bring in the big bucks onlin</u>e, then please read on because this very moment could be the turning point of your life.</strong><strong></strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I created this course because I wanted to help struggling marketers that wanted to learn T-Shirt marketing <u>sell more shirts!</u></strong><strong></strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which means using marketing and creation platforms such as Teespring and Sunfrog  can provide the perfect opportunities to make money in the T-shirt business online.

The profit to be made from the sales and creation of the T-shirts comes from the percentage above cost, meaning that the user decides how much to charge for a T-shirt (the cost of creation will be calculated by the website) and anything after the cost of making the T-shirt is the profit for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you think you have an eye for trends in fashion, or you can come up with an eye-catching design or slogan that people will want to buy, then you should try creating and selling T-shirts with Teespring or Sunfrog .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As these companies will allow you to get into the T-shirt business at no cost until you sell your product.
