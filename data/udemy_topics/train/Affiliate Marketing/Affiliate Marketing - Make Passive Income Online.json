Or are you already an affiliate marketer who is struggling to earn?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                    Finally! A hype-free, beginner-friendly course that provides actionable strategies and lessons that will help you make money by creating an \"authority content website\" on a topic that interests you.</p>\n\n<p>I'll be using my own personal experiences with specific examples to illustrate how to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll learn how to earn money from your site by joining affiliate programs and recommending products that are related to your site's content.  You earn a commission for every sale you refer, and the best part is,<strong> you don't have to ship anything or deal with the customers!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>The web is littered with massive amounts of hype about affiliate marketing, other \"make money online\" topics and no information with any real value.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                         Many of these sites and products are authored by people who aren't making a dime, and they're trying to sell you a product they don't really use or some get-rich-quick dream just so they can pad their pockets.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                  I'm not filthy rich, but I make thousands of dollars per month with affiliate marketing -- much of it is passive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                This course will put you in a position to make money with your website for the long haul by <strong>ensuring you get off to the right start with topic choice and direction -- which is where most people fail big time</strong>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                    What's even better is you can apply these principles to<strong> ANY</strong> kind of website that you want to make money from, not just affiliate sites.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                            Convincing people to buy products you are affiliated with (and making money online in general) is about gradually building yourself up as an authority and diversifying your traffic sources so you are not just relying on Google. There are specific strategies and real-world examples in this course that will help you do just that.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                            I begin with advice on how to brainstorm and do some preliminary keyword research for your best topic. <strong>There are a lot of misconceptions and myths about keyword research that I will squash</strong>.  Then it goes over the WordPress basics for setting up your website.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                            You'll also receive <strong>UP-TO-DATE</strong> info on what it really takes to rank a website today instead of outdated techniques that waste time and don't work anymore. Plus, I'll show you how to avoid getting penalized.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                            In addition, you'll learn about some email marketing strategies you can use to help drive traffic to your affiliate site and convert more sales.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                            The last section of the course is dedicated to strategies that maximize your affiliate marketing earnings.  These are techniques that I currently use myself to make money online.  I'm looking forward to sharing them with you!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>                            My course is not for anyone looking to make money online overnight, or who expects to drive all their traffic through Google</strong>. If that's what you're looking for, I'm sure you can find numerous websites and courses online that will sell you that dream.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ranking a website takes time and no longer can be done in days or a few months. This course is for people who are dedicated to their topics and sites for the long-run.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                   This affiliate marketing course is going to give you a very, very solid foundation so you understand how to build an authority website that people trust and will earn for years to come.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                It's the perfect course for newbies or people who are struggling with making money online.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                    As I stated, even though this course focuses mostly on affiliate marketing, you can use many of the strategies and principles for any kind of site that is created to generate a profit.  </p>",
