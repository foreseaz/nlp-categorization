Through a series of video interviews, which you can view in one day, students are given resources (in the form of attachments) along the way and guidance on how to succeed. Such as: what to include in your portfolio, how much to charge, how to get paid, how to deal with difficult clients, and how much money you can make on average (starting out). This is a fun course as a social study or for someone that is interested in starting a new career in the arts, to learn the inner-workings of the art business online and to start winning paid commissions. </p>",
