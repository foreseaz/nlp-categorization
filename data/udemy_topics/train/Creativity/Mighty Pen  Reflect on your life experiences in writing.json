In the middle chapters you’ll explore ###em/em### that run through your life stories, and choose one to organize your stories around. The last two chapters guide you to finish, and then share or publish your written work. The chapter outline is at right. Handouts for each chapter include exercises, tips and examples.<br></p><p>We recommend viewing one chapter a week. Of course, you can revisit previous chapters and exercises at any time.<br></p>",
