    "description": "<p>Art and Colouring for Adults</p><p>Art and colouring for adults is packed full of wonderful activities, all of which are incredibly beneficial for adults of all ages and all walks of life. Art and colouring is much more than just extremely fun to do, it’s also a substantially effective way of de-stressing. Art and colouring also helps increase focus and concentration.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This fantastic, timeless practice affords the student wellness and calm, while simultaneously stimulating areas of the brain concerned with the senses, motor skills and of course, creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This art and colouring for adults course has tons of downloadable, printable templates, ready to be coloured in. This is in direct response to the huge demand globally, for colouring books specifically designed for adults. This art and colouring course contains an array of activities and exercises such as a beginners guide to abstract drawing and  designing your own impressive hand lettering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the creator of art and colouring for adults (Libby Seery), I’ll teach you the fundamentals of drawing, including composition, perspective, shading, colours and more. I’ll also introduce you to the world of doodle art. You’ll gain access to heaps of downloadable resources, providing you with hours of fun and an opportunity to fully explore your creative side (even if you believe you haven’t got one).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The activities and exercises in this art and colouring for adults course, have deliberately been designed so you’ll enjoy art as a process, without being critical or judgemental. This course is suitable for everyone, whether you’ve no art experience or wish to hone the skills you already possess. You don’t need any expensive art materials either, as I’ll show you how to create the most stunning work, using just some basic items.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is self paced and offers you complete flexibility. Choose to study at a time and place that suits you, safe in the knowledge that help is always at hand.
