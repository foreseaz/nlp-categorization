As far as I am concerned, I have earned me the equivalent of a PhD in writing! I've also been a judge on an international writing contest, so I know what I'm doing and people respect my judgement.</p><p>My teachers (for both the books and in the courses) have been the best of the best. In other words, I've learned from the experts. In addition, I have written all my life: I've been a technical writer, scientific report writer, proposal writer, and aftermarket software writer (you know, the books you buy at bookstores that <em>really</em> tell you how to use software, with tips 'n' tricks and all that).</p><p>But always and foremost, I am a creative writer—a novelist. I currently have three novels and a collection of short stories available online everywhere. One of my books was an Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award finalist. By early 2017, I will have ten books out—five more novels and another collection of stories. </p><p><strong>Try This Course TODAY!</strong></p><p>This is a brand new course for AUTHORS.
