It's far from easy: putting some trivial issue into such words that the text will really entertain the reader or exactly touch the sore spot (<em>ouch</em>!).</p>\n\n<p>You don't have ample space: a few hundred words at max. In a good column, every phrase, every word, yes, even every comma is just in the right place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Writing columns is a craft. And therefore... you definitely CAN learn how to do it!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this special course, I will tell you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">all I know</strong> about writing columns. I will show you my approach, my way of working. I will give you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">insights</strong> in my own writing process plus sufficient <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">starting points</strong> and clues in order to get started yourself. But even more important: with my methods and working approach, you will know how to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">differentiate yourself from your competitors!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All my <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">knowledge</strong> of column writing, based on over fifteen years' experience, compressed into <strong>one great course!</strong></p>",
