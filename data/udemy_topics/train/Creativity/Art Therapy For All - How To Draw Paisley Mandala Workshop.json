In more modern Jungian psychology, the symbol stands for an effort to reunify the self.</p><p>This \"Time Without End\" workshop is a supportive tool for meditation by allowing clear and vivid visuals while occupying the motor skills.</p><p>Rozine takes artists step-by-step, creating beautiful mandala symbolism. She talks about shape and color psychology, using positive affirmations that reflect the meaning of the shapes used in the drawing.</p><p>Class is taught using 8\" x 10\" canvas board, a pencil, Elmer's Colored Paint Pens (medium nib), Black Sharpie Paint Pens (fine &amp; medium nib). Art can be painted with acrylics, watercolors, or oils. Any medium will do â€” art is your chance to express yourself.</p><p>Rozine offers suggestions on how to balance repetitive shapes and patterns. You'll also learn about how to select the best colors.</p>",
