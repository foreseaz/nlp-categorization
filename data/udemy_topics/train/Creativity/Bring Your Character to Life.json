The group managed to produce some great work, and I couldn't help but have a go myself.\" -- Workshop facilitator.</em></p><p>Character development is an integral part of creating literature. Characters tell your story on your behalf. They encourage you to emotionally invest in your own story by helping you understand themes and concepts; they instigate or reinforce some sense of identity, and of course, they provide the same rewards for your audience as well...but sometimes, we struggle with creating convincing characters, who remain believable and consistent from beginning to end.</p><p>Use this nano course to help you develop a character for your literature. Whether you're in the middle of a character sketch, struggling to get started, or just keen to experiment with a different creative writing method, this is a worthwhile experience for you. Furthermore, if you're currently doing an Arts Award, a creative writing course or participating in a writing programme, this exercise is great for building your portfolio.</p>",
