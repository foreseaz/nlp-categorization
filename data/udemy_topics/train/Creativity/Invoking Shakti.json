    "description": "<p>In the Vedic Tradition, all power sources from Shakti: Shakti is the <strong>divine feminine life force energy</strong>. The unfotunate impact of the suppression of the Divine Feminine Life force energy is that modern women juggling career, family, and relationships, have gotten so caught up in the go-go, do-do trance of the <strong>hypermasculine </strong>that you’ve lost touch with the <strong>source of your authentic feminine power.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>This leaves you feeling like you’ve never been in touch with your inner Godis or it’s been so long, you’re afraid <strong>she’s gone for good. </strong>Maybe the wake-up call has come in the form of <strong>burn-out</strong>, depression, anxiety, lack of creativity, <strong>sexual disinterest </strong>or “dysfunction.” Maybe your relationship, career or identity is <strong>falling apart</strong>. Perhaps, on the surface things look okay but underneath, your feminine soul is dying:  longing to feel, breathe and <strong>Re-member who you are</strong>.<br><br><em>You’re in the right place. Because the Godis within you isn’t dead, <strong>she is in her slumber</strong>. I can help you <strong>reawaken Her</strong>.</em></p><p><em>This is a 5 Module course going over 5 Ways our Feminine Frequency is Harmed and how to heal.<br></em></p>",
