This nano course is dedicated to helping you establish your reason for writing. The lectures and exercises provided, encourage you to tease out ideas and goals, articulate aims and objectives, and understand why your story is worth sharing with the world! There are also some wider reading materials by the inspirational George Orwell — author of the famous essay, 'Why I Write'. The work you produce on this course can be used as a pick-me-up if you ever face that dreadful writers' block, lack a little confidence or feel demotivated. If you're taking an accredited creative writing course, consider adding the work you do here to your portfolio.</p>",
