    "description": "<p>This course is very easy for someone that has a want or need for becoming a creative thinker. Creative thinking is the foundation to success and many think it's only for artists, or writers, etc. That is not true at all, and you didn't have to be born a creative thinker, they are as rare as anything is today, no, this is 100% a learned process. Creative thinkers can solve problems much easier than most, and that is why they are the most successful. The course is done with me on camera for every lecture, I speak in very simple English, I take you step by step teaching what is needed and what to either change or eliminate in your life. This training was created because of my late in life change, and if you are a younger person, this will change the way you see life, you will see opportunity all around you, and not challenges like most. Creative thinking has changed my life so much, I just had to teach it to others, because I believe if I learned this life skill earlier in life, my entire life would have been different, better, and I would have been much happier. <br></p>",
