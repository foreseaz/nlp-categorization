But where to begin?</p><p>Or, maybe you've been writing for years, but struggle to complete projects because you feel the story gets lost after a while.</p><p>Starting—and finishing—are two of the major hurdles writers face. As an avid reader and writer my entire life, I've developed a simple, step-by-step program designed to take you from the most basic idea, through the outlining process and to an amazing final product—your book done.</p><p>Join me, Patti Larsen, as I teach you what you need to know to not only complete your novel, but plan for the future of many more to come.</p><p><b>About your Instructor:</b> I've been writing from the age of twelve, creating stories long before I understood what being a writer meant. Through a university education in English and History, a journalism degree and training in screenwriting, I've combined the best of all three in a method that allows me to produce high quality work very quickly. Now a published author—both traditionally and independently—of over thirty-five novels, I'm thrilled to share my knowledge and help you get your book done. </p>",
