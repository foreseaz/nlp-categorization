However, many athletes are just told by their team, â€œBe careful what you put out there. We're watching you!\" The problem is that athletes are not told how to post items that are professional in appearance. This course is unique because it specifically teaches athletes how to use social media to professionally brand themselves while promoting their careers. Your team does not promote 100% of the athletes on the roster. So that means you need to promote yourself. <strong>In this course you will learn how to take better control of building and maintaining a professional brand on social media as an athlete. </strong>The course includes narrated presentations, exercises, quizzes, and a certificate of completion to share on your social media sites! This course will take you about 1 hour to complete, and it is structured so you can take it all at the same time, or spread it out.</p>",
