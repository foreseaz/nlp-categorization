Or high-priced products like automobiles and electronics.  </p>  <p>  \t            Branding is crucial for coaches and consultants, too.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>It can mean the difference between your business succeeding or you continuing to struggle to get clients and stay afloat.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            If you don’t want to be fighting to stand out among a sea of other service professionals in your category, you need a unique and compelling brand to set you and your business apart.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>I’ve been branding businesses of all shapes and sizes for nearly 30 years, including:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Large Corporations</li>  \t<li>Small Businesses</li>  \t<li>Start-up’s</li>  \t<li>Non-profit organizations</li>  \t<li>Independent service professionals (coaches, consultants, and other experts)</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>I developed a step-by-step proprietary branding process that I’ve been using with my private consulting clients for years.
