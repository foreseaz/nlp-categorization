    "description": "<p>After completing my studies I had to find a job in a very competitive market. I had to find a way to stand out of the crowd and decided to build a website to promote myself in a professional way. With this I had a tool to market myself when contacting relations and future employees. In the end I scored many interviews and got a job in 4 days when I arrived in Singapore.<br></p><p>It’s easy to do, and I want to help you.</p><p><strong>The result</strong></p><p>A well designed website that promotes you and helps you in your next step of your career.</p><p><strong>This course is different </strong></p><p>In this course I will teach you the very basics web programming and edit images. There will be some basic coding involved. But don’t be scared I will take you step by step. I will provide you with a template to put your own text and images in so you can create your personalised website.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><strong></strong>This course will include programming to create your website. It will not use a website builder platform where you drag/drop your images and text. Even without experience you will get the hang of it quick, but it can be challenging. </p>",
