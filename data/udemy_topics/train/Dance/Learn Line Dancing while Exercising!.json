    "description": "<p>This course is a perfect introduction to line dancing. </p><p>You will learn 9 line dances to do for exercise or to do when you go out line dancing!</p><p>The course is broken down into an introduction where I'll introduce myself.</p><p>Then the next part I'll teach you basic dance steps that are in most of the line dances.</p><p>The next section will teach the 9 line dances, with the first video going over all of the steps at a slower pace. The following video will be the line dance put together at a faster speed with a recommended song to do it to. They aren't to music so that you can do these to your favorite songs, and when you memorize them you can do them without the videos. </p><p>This course is perfect for beginners who have little or no dance experience and want to learn to line dance! You can replay the lessons as many times as you need to in order to get the hang of the line dance, or go right to the videos to do to music. </p><p>You'll always have these videos to refer back to!</p><p>I picked these 9 line dances because they are not too complicated and easier to pick up. They start out very basic and get a little more challenging as you learn each line dance. This course allows you to go at your own pace! Enjoy!</p>",
