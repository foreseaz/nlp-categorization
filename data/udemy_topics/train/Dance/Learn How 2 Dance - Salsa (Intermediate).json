Each lesson will teach you a different turn pattern and help get your comfortable with being on the dance floor.</p><p>No materials or special shoes are needed. Just an open floor and a partner to practice with. This course should take you a couple hours to complete, but it's definitely a good idea to go over the material again and again to make sure you get it to muscle memory. </p><p>This course is a MUST TAKE if you don't want to be that guy/girl standing on the sidelines while all your friends and coworkers are up dancing having fun.</p><p>Time to get out there and own the dance floor!</p>",
