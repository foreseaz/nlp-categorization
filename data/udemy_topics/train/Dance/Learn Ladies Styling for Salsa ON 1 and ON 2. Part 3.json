Here, she presents Soy Latina, a ladies&#039; salsa styling training programme, poured out over 8 hours of instruction and an impressive five DVD set.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  The first course covers the fundamental principals of ladies&#039; salsa styling, including posture, Cuban motion, push, hand design as well as a store of arm positions, taught without and with music. On course 2, there are breakdowns of basic On1 and On2 footwork patterns, followed by footwork patterns with styling. Moving onto more advanced arm styling and shine work on course 3, Irene introduces her Danzalifestyle system, with its special accent on musicality and more.Time for dancers to go deeper on course 4, as Irene teaches a score of shines to suit a range of musical rhythms, all demonstrated without and with music. After all the intensive work-outs, dancers reap the reward on course 5. Here, Irene guides salseras through footwork and styling in partner-work. The culmination is instruction on how to marry up posture, hand and arm styling and Cuban motion with partner-work.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  The setting is Irene&#039;s uncluttered studio, with all instruction given by Irene herself. Mostly, she teaches with her back to the viewer, facing a wall-size studio mirror, so you can pick up every detail. This gives the impression that this is for real - it&#039;s just you and Irene, in her studio, in a private one-to-one session. As good as it gets in terms of digital dance instruction. Well structured, with high production values, each section and disk building naturally from one to the next, this is suitable for women salsa/mambo dancers at all levels, from beginners to instructors.<br>\r\n\t  This course could serve a double purpose for dancers, as it has the potential to open up a new route to teaching. Irene is looking for dancers who excel at this foundation level programme to take on more advanced training, working towards qualifying as Soy Latina Ladies&#039; Salsa Styling teachers.For more information on becoming a Soy Latina instructor, Soy Latina workshops and intensive courses,\r\n</p>",
