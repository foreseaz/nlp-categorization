This course covers everything you need to know about leadership. Plus, it's presented in small, easy to digest doses. The lectures are well-organized and practical.\"<br></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>-Paula Redding</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Fantastic Course!</p>\n\n<p>If you are searching for a comprehensive course on Leadership than you must take this one.<br></p>\n\n<p>Ken did a great job in explaining complex concepts in down to earth action steps. He will literally take you from A to Z and provide clear strategies on how to think, behave and communicate as a leader.</p>\n\n<p>Join this Program if you want to make a difference in your life!\"</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>-George Peters</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"On the Art of Leadership</p>\n\n<p>It's rare that you see a well organized course on soft skills - this course is one such example. Leadership sounds easy until you actually experience it. But although difficult in the beginning, it is a skill which you can perfect with training. There is one thing I disagree with: integrity is touted as an important trait to gain trust as a leader. Now I value integrity for the sake of my own conscience and that's enough of a reason for me. Don't get me wrong, integrity can certainly help in the beginning, but if this was the key for leadership, the world would be a much better place.\"<br></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>-Anca Iovita</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Homerun!</p>\n\n<p>Wow, I am truly impressed with this course. Clean organization, content is in depth and actionable, instructor is engaging and is passionate about the subject. I was getting a little tired of some of the courses on Udemy, this was refreshing!\"<br></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>-Richard Moritz</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>\"Amazing Course</p>\n\n<p>Leadership skills are essential to be successful in today's society. This course is a MUST!\"<br></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>-John Camboli</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This course will take you from knowing nothing about leadership, to teaching you how to think, communicate and behave like a great leader.
