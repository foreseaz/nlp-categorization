    "description": "<p> This course shows you how to get better results in the workplace through better communications. What is emotional intelligence? Simply put, it is the ability to identify your own emotions, and the emotions of others, and to use this knowledge to guide behavior. It is a key attribute of competent leaders and managers. Rather than getting bogged down in theory, we use real world examples to illustrate what emotional intelligence is, why it is important to develop and use it in the workplace. There are useful quizzes and downloads for both yourself, and ones you can use with your team in the workplace. There are one hour of videos broken into 25 lectures.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to be a more effective workplace leader and manager, this course will help you develop and use your emotional intelligence for better workplace outcomes.<br></p>",
