He wasn&#039;t a genius or a hulk.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             But what he was, was a strong leader.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             His men went on to reach home and live long and happy lives, purely because of the <strong style=\"\">principles he stood for as a leader.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Have you ever felt inadequate as a leader?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Ever felt lost when you tried to delegate work?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Have you been unsure of how to communicate with your team?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Or do you get flustered when conflicts arise?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Richard says, ‘You don’t have to be born a leader to be a leader, you can learn it.’ And he will teach you how.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Richard Coles is a leadership expert who has motivated and instilled the qualities a leader must possess for a successful team.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                He has specially developed this course for you: something that used to be exclusive to the <strong style=\"\">W</strong><strong style=\"\">orld&#039;s Largest Airline Companies</strong> is now just a click away.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                This 13 video course provides valuable lessons surrounding the most desirable aspects of leadership, including delegation, communication, time management, creative problem solving, emotional quotient and team building through learnings borrowed from Ernest Shackleton&#039;s Expedition.  </p>",
