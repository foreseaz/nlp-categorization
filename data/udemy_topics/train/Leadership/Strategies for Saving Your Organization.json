    "description": "<p>All leaders find themselves at a point in their leadership where they need help. It could be a circumstance that needs immediate attention, or a decision that has paralyzed our leadership. Many times, church leaders face the daunting task of leading their organization into a new world full of change and challenges. This training is meant to serve as a tool for you, the leader, and your team. My desire is to help you build the best organization that is sustainable regardless of the challenging and changing times in which we live. Use the videos for yourself and your team, work through the material at your own pace, and feel free to disagree and change the ideas and theories that best suit your leadership and organization. The two things that I ask are that you allow yourself to be stretched, and allow the Lord to push and pull you toward new ideas and concepts. Show no fear. By adapting many of these theories, ideas and tools into your organization it will truly be a new day for your leadership and organization.</p>",
