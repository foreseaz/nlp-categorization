    "description": "<p>  Problem Solving, decision making and proaction are truly the three pillars of outstanding leadership.</p><p>  This hat trick of success is what companies crave from their leaders.  There probably isn’t a day that goes by where these skills are not utilized.  If we can master them, particularly proaction, we are going to be a commodity in great demand. </p><p>  In this course, we’ll examine the three step problem solving and decision making processes.  We’ll use these processes to work through a sample problem.  Finally, we’ll analyze proaction and its critical value to the effective leader.</p><p>  We will accomplish this through lecture, training aids, and Keynote slides.  There will be two quizzes during the presentation to ensure that I am communicating this information effectively for your retention.   At the end of this presentation, you’ll be prepared to systematically evaluate problems, make skillful decisions, and most importantly exercise a proactive viewpoint.  So sign up and enhance your skillset.</p>",
