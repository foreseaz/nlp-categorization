You can take the whole thing in a single hour. I don't recommend that, however. Because the content is so dense and there are follow up tasks at the end of each lecture, I strongly suggest <strong style=\"\">spreading it out over several days or a few weeks</strong>.</p><p style=\"\">*************             *************              *************               *************              *************<br style=\"\">I'm not a native English speaker. So I have to write a script for each lecture and a native speaker reads the comments in order to be clear for you what is said. Because of that the content of the course is very condensed! Not any empty words and sentences. It means that you will learn from a one-hour video of my course as much as from several hours videos of other Udemy courses! It saves your time and help you apply the proven principles into the practice faster.</p><p style=\"\">*************               *************               *************               *************              *************<br style=\"\">  \t              </p>The <strong style=\"\">course will teach you</strong>: <ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Self-motivation techniques</li><li style=\"\">Time management</li><li style=\"\">How to get information from the Deep Web</li><li style=\"\">Smart reading</li><li style=\"\">Critical thinking</li><li style=\"\">Effective, efficient note taking</li><li style=\"\">How to create mind maps</li><li style=\"\">Clear, concise academic communication</li><li style=\"\">Complex problem solving</li></ul>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br style=\"\"> This course is the second one in a project titled <strong style=\"\">“School Can Be Fun.\"</strong> If you are not sure of your basic study skills, you might want to take the introductory course “Improve Your Study Skills-Ace Exams\" first.<p style=\"\">You can also find <strong style=\"\">many other free study tips</strong> on the project's Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.</p><p style=\"\"> We offer a 30-day money back refund, so if you don't think the course helps you, you can request a refund.
