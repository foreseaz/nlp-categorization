    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tThis course is designed to give students the questions they need to study in preparing for Pre Calculus 12 Unit Tests. I have accumulated real exam questions from different high school in BC over my past 8 years of tutoring. I have only included the once that I think are highly testable in your own school. In this course, I will walk you through on each exam-type problem in an easy to understand manner. You should use this course as an accommodation to your school material (e.g. homework, quiz, practice test assigned by your school teacher). In the beginning of each sections, you will access the test questions and the answer key in pdf format. You should try the problems first,  check your answers with the key, then go through my detailed solutions on the once that you got wrong.  </p>",
