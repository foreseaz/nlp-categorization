    "description": "<p>  \t     This program is a Support Tool &amp; Guide to prepare for the CFA® Level 1 Examination to held in June &amp; December 2014. This program covers the First and Most important topic - &#039;Ethics &amp; Professional Standards&#039; (also known as &#039;ETHICS&#039; module) carrying almost 15% weight in the 6-hour Exam covering a total of 240 questions [120 questions each in Morning session (9 am to 12 noon) and Afternoon session (2 to 5 pm)]. Many candidates find that they performed or scored very well in other topics but fared poorly in Ethics and as a result could not clear Level 1. Keeping this in consideration, AFT has developed this module with about 3 hours of video lectures to make this topic easier for Candidates to grasp and understand the concepts using relevant examples at varied standards. We hope that you will find this program extremely useful.  </p>  <p>  \t <em style=\"\">  Required CFA Institute Disclaimer: &quot;CFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are trademarks owned by CFA institute.
