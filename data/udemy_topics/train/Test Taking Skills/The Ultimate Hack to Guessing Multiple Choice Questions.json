    "description": "<p>This course is carefully designed for students who occasionally turn up to exams under prepared. Using my many years of experience in writing exams, I have put together a structured system of \"guessing\" multiple choice questions (MCQs). Many questions in exams provide you with hints as to which is the correct answer. <br><br>I walk you through 11 types of hints that MCQs often provide to the student, an ultimate system of guessing a MCQ even when you have absolutely no clue about the material, and a killer exam strategy to maximise your marks even if you run out of time. </p><p>This is a<strong> MUST HAVE</strong> <strong>COURSE</strong> for any student about to undertake an exam in high school, college or university.   <br></p><p><br></p>",
