What does this mean? If you want to instill &quot;memorization&quot; in your yoga alignment and retain the &quot;perfect alignment&quot; well after your one hour yoga session, then you&#039;ll need to move the tissues that are embedded into the attachment of your joints to initiate muscle memorization<strong style=\"\">.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      With &quot;Wall Yoga - Binding Poses for Beauty and Strength&quot;,we take the simple props of the wall and a ten foot (10&#039;) yoga strap to pull and push your body into the position your body is designed to be in, one joint at a time  </p>  <p>  \t   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> Purchase your Yoga Strap <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/YogaAccessories-TM-D-Ring-Buckle-Cotton/dp/B000QIZ2XQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">HERE</a> or use a ten foot (10&#039;) band or rope.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Watch how Colette teaches that the true effect of the yoga straps goes much further than just shifting joints, it has to do with aligning the sacrum and spine to the hip or shoulder girdles for the ultimate outcome of perfect alignment! .  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> PERFECT ALIGNMENT PRODUCES PERFECT RESULTS!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      &quot;Wall Yoga&quot; with the ten foot (10&#039;) Yoga Strap is unlike anything you&#039;ve tried before!
