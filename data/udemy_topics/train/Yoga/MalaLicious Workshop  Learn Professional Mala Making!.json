    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Yoga is an 8-limb path.  The asana, or movement practice, the most popular, visible, and practiced form in today&#039;s society.  Meditation is well-known as yoga&#039;s &quot;side-kick&quot;, but in truth, it is yoga, simply a separate limb of the path.  One of the forms of meditation prescribed by ancient gurus is Japa Meditation, or chanting with what is called a Japa Mala, a prayer necklace.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Today, malas are popular symbols of yoga worn by yogis and everyday people alike, rarely aware of the meaning, purpose, symbolism or the name of this special necklace they adorn.  During MalaLicious Yoga&#039;s Intro to Making Japa Malas, you will dive into this mystical aspect of the yoga practice.  You will learn what exactly a mala is, the symbolism of mala parts, how to use a mala for japa meditation, how to incorporate malas into your yoga practice.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t You will learn my special secrets gathered from years studying in India and around the world; how to make a mala that can be used for both japa meditation and to be worn in a &quot;fashionable&quot; yoga manner.  Walking away from this course, you will be able to hand-craft a mala for yourself, for loved ones, or even set up your own mala-making buisness!  </p>",
