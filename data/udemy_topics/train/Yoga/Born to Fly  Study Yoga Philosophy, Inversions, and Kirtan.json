    "description": "<p>  \t  I want to introduce you to two powerful game changers for those traveling a yogic path-whether you are a new student or a skilled teacher.  </p>  <p>  \t  One is a physical change: how to strengthen and improve your yoga practice by adding inversions and arm balances. I present simple and advanced techniques to help dismantle fear and personal limitations.  </p>  <p>  \t  Secondly, this course fosters the deep and practical understanding of bhatki--the philosophy and motivation behind our yoga practice. To practice yoga can revolutionize the body, and for deeper understanding we explore the philosophy of bhakti: the yoga of love. As we move, work and play in this world, our devotion and ever-refining intention can revolutionize our lives. Includes incredible, noteworthy guest-speakers who are experts in yoga and yogic philosophy.  </p>",
