Are the ways you deal with anxiety not effective? </p><p>Yoga For Anxiety is designed for those of us who deal with anxiety disorders, such as General Anxiety Disorder or panic attacks. For 24 years I've dealt with panic attacks, two of which hospitalized me.

The 12 techniques in this program including breathing, yoga postures and meditation. </p><p>No previous experience is necessary to partake in this program. The 12 videos are simple to use and require nothing more than your attention (a bolster or pillows won't hurt).
