In this course we&#039;ll use writing, yoga, somatic exercises and meditation to face our fears and move forward into creating a life we love.  The course is 4 modules divided into writing and yoga.  The yoga is accessible to all levels and is less about getting into a perfect pose, but rather reconnecting to our body and allowing our energy to flow.  </p><p>So grab a journal, a yoga mat and bring your open heart.</p>",
