GOOD FOR A LIMITED TIME</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;I like the way Colette breaks down exactly step-by-step the results we are looking for in every movement and which muscles we are stretching and why because it helps me do the exercise correctly and benefit from the workout instead of just going through the motions.&quot; -Sue</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;It amazes me that after one hour of the Barry -Method class I felt better than I have in years, and I feel this is going to be more effective than any other therapy I have been through in rehabilitating my back and core strength. I look forward to my next session this week! Most Effective Therapy&quot; -Kurt P.T.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;I’m approaching 40 and my friends tell me I look better now since I’ve been training with her then I did in my 20’s!! Colette’s one on one program is absolutely addicting!! You have to try this ~ and you won’t find anyone better to train with then Colette! Thank you Colette for everything!! You’ve changed my life!!!” -Lisa</em>  </p>  <p>  \t   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">      HERE IT IS! THE ULTIMATE WORKOUT FOR GETTING PERFECTLY TONED BUTT AND LEGS. </strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t     With over 25 years experience in yoga, Pilates and bodywork, Colette discovered the most efficient way to toughen the muscles from the waist down, without a lot of sweat and pain.  </p>  <p>  \t         In Colette&#039;s<strong style=\"\">&quot;Wall Yoga&quot;</strong>unique concept of <strong style=\"\">&quot;Three Dimensional Yoga&quot;</strong>, you will see for yourself how using the wall as another force of resistance can speed up your results in a fraction of the time compared to other butt and leg routines.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Seven simple three minute videos </strong>will teach you the trick of how isometric conditioning and wall work allows you to focus directly on your target areas and trigger:  </p>  <p>  \t         A. <strong style=\"\">Muscle Memory</strong>- making a lasting effect. <br style=\"\">  \t        B. <strong style=\"\">Anatomical </strong><strong style=\"\">Origin </strong><strong style=\"\">and Insertions </strong>- connect where it affects. <br style=\"\">  \t        C. <strong style=\"\">&quot;On&quot; / &quot;Off&quot; Cycle</strong>- maximum performance for maximum results.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">There is nothing like this on the market and you WILL see results or your money back!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">WALL YOGA - BETTER RESULTS. FASTER<br style=\"\">  \t</strong>. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">EXTREMELY RATIONAL CONCEPT</strong> <br style=\"\">  \t    &quot;Wall Yoga, the body awareness, stability, and leverage of the body achieved by utilizing perpendicular planes allows the postures and breathing to be optimized. Based on my understanding of physics and physiology, this is an extremely rational way to approach yoga. Plus, Colette is so encouraging! You work with the client until they get it right and you are very patient.&quot;- Dr. Casparian  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">EXCELLENT AND INSIGHTFUL!  </strong><br style=\"\">  \t    &quot;Brilliant course! This course would assist anyone, whether beginner or more advanced in their yoga practice. Colette really knows her stuff and is clearly an experienced and insightful teacher. This knowledge also fires up the motivation to practice regularly! I will definitely be recommending this course to my yoga friends and look forward to practicing more (I have added the asanas to my daily yoga practice!)&quot; Regards, Mia Randall, meditation author.  </p>  <p>  \t      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"> SCROLL BELOW TO READ MY BIO.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YogaTrends\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Facebook</a> I<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Yoga_Trends\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\"> Twitter </a>I <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=12412275&amp;trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">in</a> I <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115557081514735774286/posts\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Google +</a>  </p>  <p>  \t<a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/barry-method-yoga/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Barry Method on a Gravity System</a> I<a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/wall-yoga-the-best-thera-ball-workout/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\"> Wall Yoga the Best Theraball Workout</a> I <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/wall-yoga-the-three-dimensional-yoga/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Wall Yoga the Three Dimensional Workout</a> I <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/wall-yoga-ultra-butt-and-legs-workout/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Wall Yoga Ultra Butt and Leg Workout</a> I <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/wall-yoga-binding-poses-for-beauty-and-strength/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Wall Yoga Binding Poses for Beauty and Strength</a> I <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/barry-method-the-perfect-workout-package/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Barry Method the Perfect Workout Package</a> I <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/wall-yoga-weights-chair-and-props-workout/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Wall Yoga Weights, Chairs and Props Workout</a>  </p>  <p>  \t      A disclaimer: If you are ill, injured or have a medical condition, please seek professional medical advice before beginning any of the practices outlined herein.
