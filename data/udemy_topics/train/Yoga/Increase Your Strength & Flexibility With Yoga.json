Although flexibility is a priority to avoid injuries in your practice, its also important to find a balance with your strength &amp; this program does just that!  </p>  <p>  \t What Strength &amp; Flexibility Yoga Includes:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Guided flows into backbends.</li>  \t<li>Breaking down individual backbends such as locust, wheel, camel, thunderbolt &amp; more!</li>  \t<li>Full  body yoga strength. </li>  \t<li>Core work</li>  \t<li>Safety tips.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t The classes are divided into 9 video lectures, each &gt;20 minutes so that you can easily fit it into your lifestyle.
