    "description": "<p>  \tWhether you&#039;ve never tried yoga, went to one class or have been practicing for many years this class is an experience for everyone. Sofa yoga is a way to do yoga using your sofa for support in different poses. Your sofa provides a comfortable place for you to do your yoga practice. If you have any knee trouble this is a great way to have plenty of padding, as well as any other areas of your body that might need extra support. The sofa is like a prop in that it allows you to push against or pull to get a deeper stretch in a safe way.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The course contains:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> one main practice on video broken into two segments</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">one shivasana video</strong> (You should have the most comfortable shivasana of your life!)  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">one hip opener video practice</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is an opportunity to explore variations of common yoga poses and stretches in a unique explorative way. Have fun with it and try to do the best you can with the poses and your sofa since every one is different. Adjust and change any poses at your discretion. You can share your experience with the community- it&#039;s the best way to learn and explore what works!  </p>",
