    "description": "<p>This exciting new 12 week <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Postnatal Transformation Yoga Program</strong> combines the core- and body- strengthening effects of a dynamic-flowing Yoga practice with therapeutic techniques to release excess tension and open the body as well as the healing power of Yin Yoga. The program is especially designed for the needs of mothers who want to reconnect to their body and get back in shape after pregnancy and birth giving. Classic Yoga Poses and Sequences like Sun Salutations are modified and adapted to the postnatal body. \n\n  \n\n</p><p>The program consists of 12 Yoga classes with different physical and/or spiritual topics. There are 4 types of classes:\n\n  </p><p>\n\n\n\n</p><p>1) Flow Sessions (5 classes): These dynamic sessions contain a variety of poses and breathing techniques to help you reconnect to your core and pelvic floor muscles. The sessions build upon each other and intensity will increase gradually. \n\n  \n\n</p><p>2) Therapeutic Sessions (3 classes): By using props (belts, blocks, balls…) you will learn to release tension from those areas which tend to become tight and painful in moms (neck and shoulders, back…) and to support the healing process. \n\n  </p><p>\n\n\n\n</p><p>3) Yin Yoga Sessions (2 classes): This very gentle, meditative practice targets the fascia (connective tissue) in long-held yoga poses and will open up blocks and tensions on a very deep level of both body and mind. \n\n  \n\n</p><p>4) Pelvic Floor Muscle Sessions (2 classes): You will learn to get in touch with your pelvic floor muscles and to activate them using props and muscle-reflex loops to build strength and stability and reduce the risk of involuntary urine leaks, back pain or organ prolapse.\n\n  </p><p>\n\n\n\n</p><p><strong>BONUS: Yoga-Quickies\n\n  </strong></p>\n\n<p>·      “Reverse Sun Salutations”: Short flowing sequence for a quick practice (under 15 minutes).\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>·      “Short n Sweet”: Complete but short session (under 30 minutes) for busy days \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>·      “Baby Meditation”: Mini-Meditation with your Mini-Me</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
