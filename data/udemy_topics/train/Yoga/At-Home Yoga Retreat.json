We need a way to escape and combat stress, information overload, and pending deadlines.  Delicious Octopus is proud to offer an online yoga and wellness retreat as an affordable getaway from the everyday.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t We’ve included tools to improve your quality of life and treats to pamper you through the process. By coupling time management and stress management tools with traditional yoga body, breath, and mind—we can increase and improve the quality of time we spend doing the things we love!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t   We designed this program to mirror traditional programs and the course follows the same schedule we prepare for some of our in-person yoga retreats. Our meal plan is designed to nourish you, our recommended spa-treatments will help you put your best face forward, and our personal development workshops will further enrich your life, giving you the chance to break through personal barriers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTreat yourself this weekend and start next Monday off with a brand new you.\r\n</p>",
