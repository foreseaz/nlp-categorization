These videos are designed to increase your flexibility and strength while improving your circulation and emotional well-being.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    There&#039;s a total of 2 hours of content with each video providing specific benefits. The videos can be completed all at once for a well rounded yoga practice, or enjoyed one video at a time for particular results.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    While this course is comprehensive enough for all levels, it might be best suited for students who already have a basic familiarity with yoga. Of course, there are difficult elements in the videos, so you are suggested to skip poses that seem too hard and to continue practicing to build up to certain poses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Each video is supplemented with a description of the video&#039;s focus and a sequence, in case you want to learn more about particular poses.\r\n</p>",
