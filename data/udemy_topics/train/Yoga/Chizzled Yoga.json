    "description": "<p>Chizzled Yoga is a complete and fun practice designed to balance and strengthen your physical, mental and emotional bodies. We are an entire being, and with this amazing course you will learn how to strengthen, align and balance your entire being… not just your physical body. We all know we need to address our mind and emotions too. With Chizzled yoga, you get a “one stop fill up” on the trifecta of overall health; body, mind and emotions.</p><p>Balance and symmetry of the physical body is done through asana, the physical postures of yoga. Each class increases your awareness of strength and balance in your structure and the muscles and connective tissue that support it. Through integration of the chakric system and yogic sutras (Yama&#039;s and Niyama&#039;s), we also learn to achieve that same symmetry in our emotional and mental energies with every practice.</p><p>When addressing the health of our “whole self” and not just the physical body, we can achieve a state of well being and radiance that fills our life with the joy most people have lost and are longing for. Join us on this journey to the life of your dreams!</p>",
