Restorative asanas (postures) have wonderful healing properties for those recovering from injuries, depression and life in general.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course will take one hour to complete. Begin by reading about what restorative yoga is and then the first video takes you through a 45 minute restorative yoga sequence. Then there is a 6 minute body scan to get you in touch with your physical being. The fourth lecture is a breathing practice to continue soothing the nervous system. You can follow along each video by listening to the instruction once you are settled into a posture. Then finally a journal writing practice.  </p>",
