    "description": "<p>Vinyasa is a method of practicing asana (physical poses), where the asanas are presented in a sequence, flowing one to the next. The practice focuses on aligning one&#039;s breath and spiritual intention with movement. The class follows a set sequence of asanas but is presented at a slower, more relaxed pace.</p><p>Beginner Vinyasa classes provide a good transition for a beginner student from Basic classes to the Spiritual Warrior or Open classes and provide an opportunity for a more advanced student to refine their skills through a more detailed exploration of the asanas presented and how they can flow together seamlessly by means of steady paced ujjayi breathing. This class is suitable for beginners, but open to all levels of practitioners.</p><p>We present a basic, 42-minute beginner vinyasa flow for yoga that will help get you loose, limber and relaxed.<br style=\"\"></p>",
