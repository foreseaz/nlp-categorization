    "description": "<p>This course is for men of any age and fitness level who wants to increase their strength, flexibility and overall fitness level in every sport and activity. Yoga has long been associated mainly with women and it's time for men to discover how convenient yoga can be as a stand alone workout or by adding it into your current fitness routines. All you need is a yoga mat, comfortable clothes and a place to practice - no weights, machines or gym is required. The course is designed to take 8 days with a new routine each day but you may also take a day or two off depending if your body needs to rest - it's up to you. There are 8 full length yoga routines in this course which become progressively more challenging each day so your body has time to adapt and radically improve. The goal is that after 8 days you'll have first hand experience in the following yoga styles: beginner, standing, balance, core, power yoga, total body flow and deep stretching. You'll build strength, flexibility, balance and control after each routine and be able to continue your yoga practice with confidence in any yoga class and into any yoga based video. I've worked with millions of guys in my live classes and via my yoga videos - why not you?</p>",
