    "description": "<p>This Prenatal Partners workshop is designed to educate couples on how to use the tools of yoga in pregnancy and childbirth. You will learn breath awareness practices, partner yoga postures and massage techniques that can help strengthen and relax the body and soothe the mind during the birth process. These approaches will give you the opportunity to connect more deeply to yourself, your partner and your baby.  The course will help birth companions support expecting mothers physically and emotionally in labor and birth. No yoga experience is required. This workshop is less about yoga and more about practicing tools to help in labor.</p><p>This practice is divided into 13 lectures. I recommend doing the entire 90 minute practice first and at least once. Then repeat any section you find helpful. I also recommend doing the massage often and deep relaxation section every day. Use the video instruction as needed and once you are comfortable with the massage techniques, you can do them on your own.</p><p>It is important to have fun and not to take it too seriously. Enjoy each other, laugh a little, and have a good time! Remember laughing is good for mama and baby!</p>",
