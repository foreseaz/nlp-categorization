    "description": "<p>  \t   In this YogiFit course with Miss Jessica kids will learn to grow into a tree, practice healthy decisions by making a salad, and go on a Space Adventure in the 30 minute class! Kids will learn our poem that we start every class with to teach them what yoga is all about!  </p>  <p>  \t  Our other short videos in this course teach them and you other yoga mudra poses to practice on a day to day basis when you have some time! They include imagery to help with relaxation and introduce children to meditation.  </p>  <p>  \tThose include:  </p>  <p>  \t Kalesvara  </p>  <p>  \tAnjali  </p>  <p>  \tPran &amp;  </p>  <p>  \tShaakini Mudras  </p>  <p>  \t   In the 30 minute class we move through fun, imaginative yoga poses where kids can pretend they are flying high in the sky, growing into a tree, and traveling in outer space with their hula hoop! This class teaches children many common yoga poses in a fun way to keep them engaged.  </p>  <p>  \t   Children will learn some sanskrit words like Namaste. They will learn the words for peace and love in another poem that helps them build compassion.  </p>  <p>  \t   Class ends with relaxation so children can learn to rest their bodies, still their mind and breathe deeper. Relaxation also helps children to have a few moments without stimulation to explore how they are feeling internally.  </p>  <p>  \t   Class ends with our rest poem to help children understand why they are relaxing.  </p>  <p>  \t   YogiDance is a yoga-based exercise program  for kids. We combine yoga, hula hooping and teach relaxation in every  class for the following reasons:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Yoga improves balance, flexibility, and patience</li>  \t<li>Breath training develops healthy minds and improves focus and relaxation</li>  \t<li>Hula hooping and games burn calories and strengthen the abdomen</li>  \t<li>Non-competitive atmosphere Increases resilience and          stress-coping capabilities</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t       YogiDance provides children with a nurturing environment to build  self-confidence where no one loses and creativity is encouraged! Expect your child to finish, happy, relaxed and ready for anything!  </p>  <p>  \t   Miss Jessica teaches the class in this video, and there are no children in the video.  </p>  <p>  \t  Children should not do yoga at least an hour after eating, and should wait 30 minutes after the class to eat.  </p>",
