We then progressively improve flexibility and range of motion in the calves &amp; hamstrings, spine, hips &amp; hip flexors, quads, abs &amp; obliques. We learn all the basic yoga poses including sun salutations.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        The course includes:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">15 x 15 minute HD videos</li>  \t<li style=\"\">An introduction to yoga</li>  \t<li style=\"\">15 beautifully designed handouts on technique, anatomy and physiology</li>  \t<li style=\"\">A step-by-step guide to creating your yoga habit</li>  \t<li style=\"\">An extensive pose library</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \tThere are 4 other challenges in this series, to complete your yoga practice - Balance, Mobility, Relaxation and Strength.  </p>",
