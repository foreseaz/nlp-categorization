Hatha Yoga has made a loud boom in today's fitness world. The growing popularity of Hatha Yoga weight loss classes has lead a number of individuals from the fitness community to try this ancient, classic yoga style. This particular style of yoga encourages a sharp mind and promotes a solid mind-body connection. This course can help beginners know more about traditional yoga while practicing newer styles yet keeping the authentic principles of yoga during the sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Hatha Yoga origins</strong><br>According to Ellen Stansell, PHD, Registered Yoga Teacher, scholar of yogic literature and Sanskrit, Hatha Yoga is a hollistic yogic path. It originated early in the 15th Century and is a system which was described by a young Hindu sage, Yogi Swatmarama. He was the compiler of the old text, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, which scholars use to learn more about this particular practice of yoga. In ancient times, Hatha Yoga was said to be used to help individuals enter into long meditative states because of its relaxing characteristic.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The meaning of Hatha Yoga</strong><br>Hatha Yoga has different meanings. It is sometimes referred to as \"dual\" or \"opposite\" because of the root meanings found in the name. When disected, the name means \"Ha\" for the sun and \"Tha\" for the moon, which are two opposites. Some people who practice this form of yoga call it \"yoking yoga\" because it forms a connection between two opposites. The Hatha Yoga poses are seen as structures which combine two different things that in turn help activate the purification of the mind and the body.<br><br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Hatha Yoga structure</strong><br>The structure of Hatha Yoga exercises are built on the concept mentioned above, it is of opposites. It can sometimes be seen as hot and cold, male and female, light and dark. Traditionally, Yoga is seen to use eight limbs. This is common in the practices of Ashtanga Yoga. However, in Hatha Yoga postures are commonly referred to as Sananga, meaning \"of six parts\" or \"six limbs\". All of these six limbs represent a crucial part in the practice. The balance of all parts is what brings wholeness to the yogi practicing Hatha Yoga. Controlling breathing, readying the mind, and meditating.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Other derivative forms of Hatha Yoga</strong><br>Hatha Yoga is one of the traditionally established forms of practice. This particular branch of yoga sometimes lends its historical styles to more modern forms. Hatha Yoga has been used as the basis for a more recently founded form known as Anusara yoga, which was only established during the late 20th Century. John Friend, the man who first practiced this newer form of yoga used Hatha yoga's concept and ideas as a basis and foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Reasons why you should try Hatha Yoga</strong><br>There are a lot of reasons why you should try this ancient form of yoga. Many yogis practicing this form of yoga find that they have managed to tap into their inner being in a way that their minds and bodies flow as one. It is because of the strong meditative characteristic of this form of yoga that many yogis are able to become comfortable with the basic poses. </p>",
