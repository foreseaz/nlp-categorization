    "description": "<p>Namaste Yogis and Fitness enthusiast, welcome to Beginner Yoga and HIIT Series. Although this is Month 2 of the Beginner Yoga series it can be used on it's own as a complete course. If you consider yourself slightly more experienced than a complete beginner feel free to start with month 2 . All 3 parts of the Beginner Yoga Series are appropriate for beginners. They are designed to challenge you and get you FIT. The intensity turns up with each course so I do recommend following the course from Part One if you have no previous experience in fitness and yoga. The course is designed in a way that allows you to have enough time to learn the new movements and familiarize yourself with the basic terms and exercises. By the end of the course you will feel stronger, more flexible, have greater endurance, with better cardiovascular capacity as well as calmer and more grounded. You can continue with Part Two for as long as its challenging or for as long as you enjoy it. Then move onto Part Three whenever you feel ready for a change  and to turn the heat up. I recommend practicing each part for at least one month. By following this series and committing a small portion of your day to your health it will help you stay uplifted and get fit in an enjoyable way. </p>",
