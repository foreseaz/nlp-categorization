    "description": "<p>My name is Siobhan Ní Ghallchóir and I would love to help you learn the basics in starting and maintaining a simple conversation in the Irish language. I won’t be boring you with grammatical terms or tenses, or confusing things, instead I will get down to the nitty gritty! I will be launching another course shortly which will cover these more advanced topics. So for now we’re just getting stuck in to learning basic phrases and words which you may find useful.</p>  <p>Perhaps you’re thinking of visiting us here in Ireland and would like your ‘cupla focal’, or you are longing to learn the language of your ancestors, but whatever your reasons, my main aim is to bring to you an enjoyable learning experience.</p>",
