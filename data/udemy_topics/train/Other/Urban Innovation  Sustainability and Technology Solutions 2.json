It is a look at the challenges and practical responses related to urban sustainability through the theme of urban social equity. For those interested, a separate course in this series <strong></strong>focuses on real world examples within two other key urban innovation themes: smart cities and transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Course material is based on case studies, seminars, and conference sessions from the Meeting of the Minds international network and annual summit. Lectures are presented by topic experts; presentation slides and other helpful resources are included where applicable. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Optional multiple choice quiz questions follow the lectures for those students wishing to test their new knowledge or obtain a course completion certificate.

Students can proceed at their own pace and may view as many - or as few - of the lectures as they choose. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"Urban Innovation: Sustainability and Technology Solutions â€“ Part 2\" was created by Christina Olsen for Meeting of the Minds.</p><p><br></p>",
