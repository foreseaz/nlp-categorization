If you have ever thought about learning to ride and didn't know where to start, then you have come to the right place. I start off in my first section teaching you have to \"take off\" on the bike for the first time. You will learn exercises to learn the controls in a safe progressive manner. As the course progresses I get more technical and teach the finer points of riding so you can develop skills that I've learned over a life-time of riding. </p><p>  \t          In this course I will take you from a \"bike-less dreamer\" to a motorcycle owning, confident rider! I show you how to choose a first motorcycle that fits you, places to buy it, and what to watch out for. </p><p>You'll learn how to choose the proper riding gear to keep you safe and comfortable.
