    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t              The course is designed for English speaking students  who want to learn the basics of Polish language for travelling or business purposes. The course covers introduction, greetings, necessary phrases for the tourists, asking for directions, ordering a meal at a restaurant, purchasing a train ticket, booking a hotel room, etc.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              The course is comprised of videos, power point presentations, and quizzes. It should take approximately a week or two to complete the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              The advantage of the course it that it is designed in a simple and straightforward way, it avoids too complicated expressions that usually confuse the beginners and the phrases are repeated slowly by the instructor.  Also, the instructor adds some cultural facts about Poland, which will hopefully prepare the student for the best experience while travelling to this country.  </p>",
