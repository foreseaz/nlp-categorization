    "description": "<p>  \t Time travel anyone?  Well, sort of... By creating computer forensic images from volume shadow copies you are able to capture the system in different points in time- going back days, weeks, months or even years.  Drop these images into your favorite computer forensic tool and suddenly your pulling up previous versions of documents and deleted files and folders.  I have used this technique to overcome the effects of computer &quot;wiping&quot; and &quot;cleaning&quot; utilities.  This class teaches you how to identify and create these images in a few quick steps- no high cost computer forensic tools needed.  In fact, you will be amazed how easy it is to do.  If you are a computer forensic analyst then this is one of the top skills you need to have.  </p>",
