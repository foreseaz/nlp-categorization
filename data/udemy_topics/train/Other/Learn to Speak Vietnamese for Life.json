    "description": "<p>This course is for anyone who wants to <strong>become fluent in the Vietnamese language</strong> or simply learn some conversational phrases and vocabulary before making a trip to Vietnam. It's also for anyone seeking to simply <strong>communicate with your Vietnamese friends or neighbors.</strong></p><p>It is designed to <strong>teach you Vietnamese in the shortest possible time</strong> frame by using the same strategies that I used when I first learned the language while living in Vietnam. I'll teach you tricks and tips along the way that allow you to understand popular phrases and slang, as well as how to <strong>properly pronounce the difficult tones</strong> and accents of Vietnamese.</p><p>I have structured the course into short, instructional videos that allow you to focus on one subject at a time <strong>without getting overloaded with too much information</strong>. I have adapted some of the grammar and sentence structures from the very popular language textbooks used at the University of Sociology and Language Arts in Ho Chi Minh City which are the core building blocks of the language.</p><p>Everything in the course is <strong>useful in everyday situations</strong> so you will never be spending time studying something that is not totally applicable in the real world right away. Most language courses have a lot of this kind of superfluous material which is quite inefficient and waste a lot of time covering unnecessary vocabulary and grammar rules. Our course is designed for <strong>efficiency AND proficiency</strong>.</p>",
