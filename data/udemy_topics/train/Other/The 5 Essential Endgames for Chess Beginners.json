    "description": "<p>Having achieved the title of chess master and worked as a coach for over 5 years, I've seen how students are easily intimidated by the idea of \"learning the endgame\" and don't know where to start. Many who attempt to learn the endgame are overwhelmed by the available resources on the subject, all of which overestimate the level of knowledge students really need to have.<br><br>To cut through the confusion, I created \"The 5 Essential Endgames for Chess Beginners\" course, which covers 90% of the endgames you'll ever need to know quickly and affordably. This course, designed for chess beginners up to 1200-rated tournament players, is composed of 20 compact lessons and is priced less than the cost of an average private lesson. By the completion of this course, you will be well on the path to endgame mastery and should see improved play in all aspects of your game.<br></p>",
