Without social skill proficiency, you'll always struggle with the most important things in life. By studying the best conversationalists, you'll upgrade your own skills. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What\nwould you discover if you recorded and analyzed every conversation you\nencountered or observed for the last 15 years? You could potentially <strong>unlock the\nsecret of what separates the best conversationalists from everyone else</strong>. I did\njust that. I deconstructed the behaviors and conversations of the best\nconversationalists I could find. The end result is my book, Everyday\nConversations, and this training.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This training covers the <strong>Seven Habits of Exceptional Conversationalists</strong>. What they do differently, what they say, and what you can do – starting right now. Learn hundreds of actionable techniques for helping you survive – and thrive – in every kind of conversation and social situation. Contains hundreds of real-life examples! No fluff, just the good stuff.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Greg</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
