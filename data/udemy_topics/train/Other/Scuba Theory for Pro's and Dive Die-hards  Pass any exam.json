    "description": "<p>We have designed this course for divers training to be dive guides and dive instructors, but all divers can gain a lot from learning more about the diving environment, the physics of diving, dive equipment, the physiology of diving and decompression theory. You need no prior knowledge to do this course. This dive theory  course consists 5 sections with in total 35 lessons: 13 small text lessons and 22 video's (two and a half hours of video in total) and a quiz after each section. There is extra material to practice, and we included many informative links to sites and video's that deal more in depth with the subject. This is  a complete dive theory course, and it will take around 15 hours to complete it. It is the ideal way to prepare for theory exams for dive professionals, or to get to know the theory behind your hobby.</p><p>We hope you will enjoy learning about the thing you love: diving. We designed this course to help you understand what is happening and why it happens before, during, and after a dive. Many of you will be preparing for an exam to become a dive professional. This course tells you all you need to know. You need no specific software or prior knowledge to follow this course. You do need a calculator for the physics section, and of course you must be interested in diving! </p><p></p>",
