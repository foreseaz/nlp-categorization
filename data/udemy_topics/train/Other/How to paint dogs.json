The course depends on how fast you can paint, but I if you go step by step your first artwork will take you about  2 weeks.</p><p>This course is structured in such a way that if you follow the steps as they are you can make a great painting. Step by step don´t be in a hurry, if it doesn´´t work, put it down and start again the next day.  Some paintings take months to finish, there should be no rush at all. </p>\n\n<p><em>The course is about painting not drawing so before we start make sure that you have already drawn your model (dog) on the canvas. You only have to draw the outlines and the situation of the eyes and nose. The rest we will paint.</em></p><p>We are all artist, artist with their own ways and their own thoughts, and together we create a Great World of Art.</p><p>Marqueritte Clasquin</p><p>It Heidenskip, The Netherlands.</p>",
