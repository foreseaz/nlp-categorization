It aims to provide an understanding of everything you need to know to live with a diagnosis of glaucoma through a combination of videos and tests designed by health care professionals working in the field of Ophthalmology.  </p>  <p>  \t  You can do the course in your own time and can dip in and out of the course to cover those bits which are of particular interest to you.  </p>  <p>  \t  We hope that the course gives a good introduction but are keen to make it even better so if you have any suggestions about ways that we can improve the course we&#039;d really like to hear from you.  </p>",
