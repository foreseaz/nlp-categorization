    "description": "<p><strong>SQL Server</strong> is a massive, <strong>complex</strong> product. </p><p><strong>One</strong> DBCC <strong>command</strong> can have over one hundred <strong>thousand</strong> lines of <strong>code</strong>.</p><p>Once you’ve <strong>learned</strong> the <strong>basics</strong>… creating tables, inserting data, backing up databases… <strong>then what?</strong> </p><p>The<strong> daily routine </strong>of a database developer or DBA often <strong>doesn't</strong> involve internal structures. </p><p>I’ve been <strong>driving</strong> for 30 years but <strong>don’t</strong> know the parts to my <strong>car’s</strong> engine. Well, I’m not mechanic either. </p><p>If you want to <strong>understand</strong> how SQL Server really operates then you have to undertake a study of <strong>how</strong> the two core <strong>engines</strong> of SQL Server work with one another. </p><p>The <strong>storage</strong> engine stores data and the <strong>optimizer</strong> processes queries. </p><p>This <strong>course</strong> will <strong>provide</strong> you with a solid <strong>foundation</strong> in <strong>storage</strong> internals. We are going to cover how <strong>data</strong> is stored at a very low level. </p><p>You’ll <strong>learn</strong> the <strong>vernacular</strong> specific to the page and several <strong>new commands </strong>that will provide us with some <strong>deep</strong> insight into what any <strong>how</strong> SQL Server <strong>stores</strong> data. </p><p>We will <strong>cover</strong> the <strong>data</strong> row structure and the <strong>transaction</strong> log and by the end of this course you’ll <strong>understand</strong> how data moves in SQL Server. </p><p>This <strong>knowledge</strong> will help you <strong>troubleshoot</strong> SQL Server at a level most DBAs simply <strong>don’t </strong>grasp. We will look at examples and code syntax to determine what works and what doesn’t. </p><p>Any <strong>relational</strong> database is a collection of <strong>objects</strong>, the <strong>table</strong> being the most <strong>fundamental</strong>. </p><p>However, what they <strong>are</strong> and what they <strong>do</strong> are two different things. <strong>Relational</strong> databases have <strong>entities</strong> called transactions that transfer and <strong>manipulate</strong> <strong>data</strong>. </p><p>This <strong>course</strong> will focus on <strong>how</strong> and what these <strong>transactions</strong> are moving. </p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> for you interest in <strong>SQL Server Internals.</strong></p><p><strong>I’ll see you in the course!!!</strong></p>",
