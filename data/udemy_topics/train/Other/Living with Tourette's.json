    "description": "<p>  \t      Coming directly from Dave's 45 years of experience living with this condition, this course covers basic and generalised information about Tourette's from his own personal experience as a sufferer. While briefly describing Tourette's Syndrome and general Symptoms,for which there is plenty of information available, this course deals mainly with day to day tips for various life situations with encouragement for living with or encountering this unusual condition. Dave's course comes from the experiences of what he, and others he has met, have had and, because all \"Touretters\" are individuals, may or may not cover all situations experienced by sufferers.</p>\n\n<p>  \tDave is an Adult Educator with a Bachelor Of Education degree and is currently completing a Masters in Education in career development. He has run small businesses and is also a  licensed Electrician. </p>",
