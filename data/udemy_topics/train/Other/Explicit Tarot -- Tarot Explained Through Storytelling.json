    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  More than anything, tarot is designed to help you tell and understand stories -- whether they are your own, or that of your clients. Yet, when learning tarot, it&#039;s easy to get bogged down by a myriad of interpretations without fully understanding the intrinsic meaning of each card. Suddenly you&#039;re trying to remember five meanings for one card -- and you still haven&#039;t completed a tarot reading.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Explicit Tarot is a tarot course designed to teach you the core meanings of each tarot card. Through stories and simple techniques, Explicit Tarot will teach you the major themes of all 78 cards, with tangible examples of how those meanings translate to the real world. You&#039;ll receive downloadable worksheets so that you can take notes, and over three hours of videos to teach you everything you need to know to start actually reading tarot, instead of just memorizing it.  </p>",
