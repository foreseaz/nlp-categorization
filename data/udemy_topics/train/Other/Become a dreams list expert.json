That is why I created this course!  To help you with what I needed help with.  Now, a dreams list can't give you instant control on your life, but<strong> it can help you focus</strong> on what you really want!</p><p>This course is great for whether you want to focus down on your own life, or give the gift of focus to your employees.  <strong>You will be amazed</strong> at the <strong>increased productivity</strong> when you can <strong>teach an employee</strong> how to create their own dreams list!</p><p>This course will take you approximately <strong>1-2 hours to complete</strong>, and then I suggest going back to your dreams list often to keep it current!</p><p>I made this to be a <strong>step-by-step course</strong>.  You can follow along and get ideas for your dreams list!</p><p><strong>Have fun! :)</strong></p><p><br></p>",
