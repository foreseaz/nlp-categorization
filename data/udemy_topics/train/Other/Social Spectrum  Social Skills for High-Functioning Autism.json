    "description": "<p>People with high-functioning autism often struggle with social situations.  Though they are able to quickly learn subjects that interest them, reading people is a separate challenge made worse by the fact that many people do not treat social skill as actual skills, but instead as something you either get or you don&#039;t.  It doesn&#039;t have to be this way.  In this 12-part video course, professional mentalist and speaker Alexander Vornoff, who is on the spectrum himself, will teach students the basics in approaching people, having conversations, and reading non-verbal communication in order to set them on the road to becoming a socially stand-up person.  Along with the video lectures are several challenges to get you out into the world and practicing what you&#039;ve just learned.  All you need is the will to make it happen!</p>",
