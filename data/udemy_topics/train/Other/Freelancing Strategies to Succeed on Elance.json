The goal of this course is to teach you the Elance strategies I learned so that you can increase your earnings and generate steady workflow.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn this course you will receive:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Lectures detailing my experience with Elance and highlighting the strategies I used to find success.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">My go-to documents and templates, including correspondence samples, several of my winning proposals, and an in-depth Elance pricing analysis surveying more than 100 job postings and bids that will help you better price your services to make more money on each and every project.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Tips for how to generate recurring work from clients and how to make your profile stand out, just to name a few.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \tIf you are looking to take your freelance career to the next level, this course is for you!  </p>",
