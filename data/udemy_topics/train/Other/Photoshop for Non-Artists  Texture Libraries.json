We'll explore filters, layer styles, blend modes, and more to maximize the heavy lifting Photoshop does for us when creating textures. By the end of the course, you'll have a strong start to a library of base textures you can use to create designs for games, web development, and more. You'll practice a little hand painting of textures, and complete 3 projects. Two 2D game pieces and a desktop background.</p><p>No Wacom tablet is needed. You can complete this training using only a mouse!</p>",
