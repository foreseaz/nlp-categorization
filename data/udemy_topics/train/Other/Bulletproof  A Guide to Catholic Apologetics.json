    "description": "<p>This course is designed for people of the Catholic Faith who would like a better understanding surrounding the beliefs and it's traditions.  There is so much more to know about Catholism than what is gained by attending weekly Mass.  Most Catholics can tell you what they believe but cant tell you why.  This course will provide the answers to most questions using the Bible.  We will first discuss Christianity and its beginnings.  Then follow with the history of the Bible.  After that, this course will take a deep dive into the Biblical Scripture that supports Catholic teachings.  With over two hours of lectures, students will gain a solid foundation in their beliefs. A foundation thats necessary when defending their faith against those who are trying to find faults.</p>",
