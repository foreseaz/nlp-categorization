No doubt that computer systems have come a long way since their inception, but their fundamental operating principles are very simple to understand. This course is the <strong>first of many courses</strong> which aims at giving you all the information you need to begin your journey into digital electronics.  </p>  <p>  \t    You will learn why we need <strong>different numbering systems</strong>, <strong>what makes transistors tick</strong>, <strong>conversions between numbering systems</strong> etc.  </p>  <p>  \t    This course contains just the topics you need to know: nothing more, nothing less. The bonus material also features a basic introduction to color codes which is frequently encountered in <strong>web design</strong>, and <strong>software development</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t  You should take this course if you plan on working (or are currently working) with <strong>computer systems</strong>, <strong>electronics</strong>, <strong>programming</strong> and allied fields.  </p>",
