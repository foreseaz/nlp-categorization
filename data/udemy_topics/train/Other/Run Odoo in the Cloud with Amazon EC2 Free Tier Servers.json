Maybe you have been able to get Odoo installed and running but have struggled setting up and configuring Odoo so it is easily accessible by your own domain name.  If you are in that spot in which you can 'kind of' get Odoo running but want more knowledge on how to use Odoo in the cloud this course is for you.</p><p>We then take you all the way to a fully working Odoo installation you can access from your own domain name. The course leaves nothing out. </p><p><strong>Odoo Class has produced more than 100 Odoo Videos</strong></p><p>Odoo Class is recognized as the #1 source of Odoo Video Training and Workshops.
