It doesn't teach you a specific language, but rather explains <strong>how to master any language at daily conversation level in weeks</strong> instead of years. </p><p>In this course, I will show you <strong>how to memorize vocabulary quickly</strong>, and how to select what to learn and what to dismiss. I will reveal to you <strong>the core structures you need to master</strong> to kickstart your initial understanding of the new language you are dealing with. I will show you <strong>how to take years of language experience and acquire them in just weeks</strong>, so quickly in fact that <strong>you will be speaking in your new language after just a couple of weeks of practice</strong>. </p><p>After a few weeks, you will be able to <strong>understand people speaking</strong>, and most of what they're saying, and after just a few months, you will have <strong>mastered the core components and will be able to hold a conversation naturally</strong>. I did this for english, I did this for japanese, I did this for spanish, and I was able to communicate after just a few short weeks in those languages, while my friends were usually still stuck with a few words. </p><p>The course is taught in English, includes<strong> 29 lectures for over 100 minutes of video tuition</strong>, PDF Files for reference, presentations, and quizzes. </p><p><strong>The course is updated and upgraded on a regular basis.</strong></p><p><span></span><strong>In this course I show you how I do it, and how you can too.... </strong></p>",
