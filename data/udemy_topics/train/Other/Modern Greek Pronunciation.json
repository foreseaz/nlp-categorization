    "description": "<p>  \t    When learning a foreign language, pronunciating the words correctly from the very beginning is a key factor to speaking quickly and easily. After all, it is easier to prevent bad habits than to break them.  </p>  <p>  \t    And that is why this course focuses only on Greek pronunciation. So take this course  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>if you want to study Greek      on your own, but you &#039;re not sure if you are pronunciating the words      correctly.</li>  \t<li>if you already have a      teacher, but do not want to waste valuable lesson time on just the alphabet.</li>  \t<li>if you want to visit Greece      and wish to be understood by the locals.</li>  \t<li>before learning grammar,      syntax or everyday expressions.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t    The steps are simple. See, listen and repeat. See the vowel, listen to the vowel, then repeat it. See the consonant, listen to the consonant, then repeat it. See the word, listen to the word and then repeat it. Then move on to the section of vowel and consonant combinations, where explanations are provided in advance. And once this section is completed, you will be ready to proceed to full texts.  </p>",
