Perhaps one of the least recognized and most beneficial methods of pest control is using predatory bugs to keep in check the harmful ones. </p><p style=\"\">    In this course, we will look at 22 of the most beneficial garden predators. Do you have trouble with aphids, caterpillars, bean beetles, or the plethora of other pests around? Then this course is for you. We will not only examine which bugs are beneficial and how to identify them, but will also look at the plants and herbs that will attract them to your garden. Go no further for organic pest control, we have you covered right here! </p>",
