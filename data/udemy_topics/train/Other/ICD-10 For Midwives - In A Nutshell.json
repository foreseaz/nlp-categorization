    "description": "<p style=\"\">ICD-10 is the first full replacement of medical diagnosis coding in 30 years, has 160,000 codes. This is a huge increase from the 17,000 codes of ICD-9. Because of this, there is no automatic 1-to-1 mapping system for codes. Some codes will only have one accurate option under the new system, but most will have multiple options. </p><p style=\"\">General predictions regarding the switch over predict coding productivity to decline by 10-15%, and increased problems with insurance claims, including not only an increase in processing time, but also an increase in denials. </p><p style=\"\">This brief class will give you the midwifery-specific basics regarding ICD-10, so that your practice can head these problems off at the pass.</p>",
