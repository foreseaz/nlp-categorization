This course is for you if you want to deepen your basic knowledge of C++, you want to learn C++ 11 features, or you've taken my free beginners' C++ course and you're looking for the next step.</p><p>We'll start with a look at C++ file handling and move through STL, template classes, operator overloading, lambda expressions, move constructors and much more besides.</p><p>At the end of the course I'll show you how to create a program that generates fractal images, using a a few of the language features we've seen in the course and giving you a great work out with smart pointers and arrays.</p><p>I'll give you exercises throughout the course, ranging from easy near the start, to quite tricky (but optional!) near the end of the course.</p>",
