I have applied them myself and I successfully learned to speak a few languages rapidly. Inspired by their methods I set out to help others by compiling my research into this intensive course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed for anyone, regardless of experience level. Whether you have experience in language learning or not, at the end of this course you will be able to successfully learn a foreign language on your own. You just need to be open-minded and willing to experiment new techniques. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don't need to be talented. You don't need to have a special language learning gene. With the right mindset, the method and the techniques in this course you can achieve fluency in the next 6 months. Enjoy your language learning journey!</p>",
