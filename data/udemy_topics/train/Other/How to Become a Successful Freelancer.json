This course will give you an introduction to what it takes to apply your entrepreneurial spirit and build or strengthen your career as a freelancer, so you have a foundation for exploring further on your own. It&#039;s not an in-depth study, but rather an intro to some key topics for getting up and running as an independent worker, or becoming a more successful one.  </p>",
