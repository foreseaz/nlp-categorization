    "description": "<p><strong>Build Your Own Empire In The Music Business</strong><br></p><p>My name is Jae Preme. I was just like you. Working for a boss, instead of being one. I had a passion for music, like you, and knew what my dream was but didn't know how to make it a reality. After a lot of hard work, I realized my vision and now own my own record label.</p><p>I have another passion, helping others. I followed my dreams, but spent countless hours researching, failing through trial and error with no real guide to help me. Now, I'm passing what I have learned on to you. </p><p><br><strong>Create, Like a Boss</strong> <br>You're here because you love music you want to make money from your music, and you want what the great entrepreneurs in the music business have. A <strong>Music Business</strong> empire. Artists like Tech N9ne, Master P, Nipsey Hussle, Jay-z, Dom Kennedy, and a host of others have all seen independent success with their music. It’s possible for you also and I'm going to show you how to get started on your journey. </p><p><br><br><strong>So, why this course out of all the courses out there on starting a record label? </strong></p><p><br><br><strong>Real simple! Everything You Need, One Course </strong><br>You may be saying to yourself, \"I don't know anything about the Music Business.\" This course compiles everything you need to know to start from scratch with no prior experience. Starting with the basics and providing you with the step-by-step instructions that I would have loved to have had myself when I started. </p><p><br>Some of the information in those other books and courses are great, but a lot of it is so outdated. This is the digital age baby!! Most of that information that you get from other courses apply to brick &amp; Mortar record label startups. In these times you can legitimately start a digital record label with way less money than you had to back in those times. The cool thing about it is you can do it right from home. This course is geared toward the digital age and provides tons of online links to sources you will need to utilize. This saves time on doing all the searching yourself online. <br></p><p>If you are an artists like myself, the <strong>music business</strong> is wide open for us these days. No longer do we have to hope, and wish, for a record deal. Now I’m not saying getting a record deal is a bad thing at all, but why not at least make an attempt at doing it yourself and then reaping all the benefits in the long run? </p><p><br>If you are looking to sign to a label I would suggest you sign to a strong independent record label who is applying the business strategies and techniques that I am going to share with you in this course. </p><p><br>I’m going give you all the information you are going to need to start your digital record label, but if you don’t apply it, years will go by and you will still be a dreamer in the same position you were in five years ago. </p><p><br>Oh, and another thing, I can’t guarantee your label will be successful because if your music sucks, or your artist music suck, you are going to have a hard time no matter what genre of music you’re in. </p><p><br><br><strong>So what is it that you are going to learn in this course you ask? </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Business setup </strong></li><li><strong>Releasing your music on iTunes and other digital music platforms </strong></li><li><strong>How to register your songs to make money from publishing </strong></li><li><strong>Marketing and promotion </strong></li><li><strong>Recording a project and what you need to get it done yourself </strong></li><li><strong>Ways to make money from music placements </strong></li><li><strong>Shooting your own music videos </strong></li><li><strong>Making money on YouTube </strong></li><li><strong>All the extra stuff you won't find from a Google search </strong></li></ul><p>And much more… <br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stop Dreaming, Start Doing</strong> <br>The secret to success isn't about luck. Successful people create their own luck. They seek out the resources they need to get things done. They put in the time and work. They get out there and do it. You have a dream, get out there and live it! </p><p><br>If you are lazy, unmotivated, lackadaisical, spoiled, or just a negative person this course is not for you. You at least have to be first willing to change your mindset, attitude, and the way you look at life. <br></p>",
