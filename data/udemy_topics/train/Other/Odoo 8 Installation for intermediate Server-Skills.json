You just need Ubuntu 14.04 or a Operating System which can run Virtualbox (a free Virtualisation Software).</p><p>For all interested people in Odoo 8 this is a must have course to take. It's about a way in order to get odoo running on a local server. If you get this idea right, you can host Odoo on a local Server (let's say on your computer itself) or a server in your enterprise. Where this host will be is only limited to your infrastructure. The best thing is: you do not need to buy Odoo (SaaS) package and this installation is not limited to a specific amount of users or time range.</p><p>But we will not only install Odoo, we will install all the required software like: </p><p>- A virtualization software (VirtualBox) which is free</p><p>- The Linux Operating System Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Long Term Support) which is also free. </p><p><br></p>",
