    "description": "<p>With the explosion of unmanned aircraft, particularly multi-rotor UAS, it has become clear that there is a need operators to have a better understanding of applicable regulations, fundamental flight maneuvers, mission  planning, operations in controlled airspace, communication practices, flight resources, weather factors, risk management, situational awareness and safe operating procedures.   In recognition of these facts, the FAA proposed under the NPRM (14CFR§107)  list of eleven areas of study which the UAV operator should know, as described in section §107.73  for “initial and recurrent knowledge tests” (Page 190)</p><p>(1) applicable regulations relating to small UAS rating privileges, limitations, and flight operation; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(2) airspace classification and operating requirements, obstacle clearance requirements,  flight restrictions affecting small UAS operation; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(3) official sources of weather and effects of weather on small UAS performance; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(4) small UAS loading and performance; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(5) emergency procedures; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(6) crew resource management; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(7) radio communication procedures; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(8) determining the performance of small UAS; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(9) physiological effects of drugs and alcohol; \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>(10) aeronautical decision-making and judgment; and </p><p>(11) airport operations</p><p>Those are the areas which will be covered in this training course. </p><p>Please note, however, while the course materials are based on the NPRM/FAR §107 and other FAA study materials, this course is not represented in any way as an official FAA training course.<br></p>",
