Why?</p>    <p>The problem lies in the fact that we have  had to study for years at school but nobody told us How to Prepare For Exams. Experts agree that traditional read  and memorize methods doom you to failure. Modern techniques developed by  learning gurus include speed reading, visualization techniques, motivational  strategies, visualization and many other methods which have been proven to work  time and time again.</p>    <p>My name is  Paul Browning and I&#039;ve been studying for most of my life. School, police  promotion exams, a law degree and then several IT exams. I&#039;ve learned what  works really well and I&#039;ve been sharing these ideas for several years with many  thousands of students via my IT certification websites.</p>    <p>I hope you  enjoy learning the easy way to study, remember and ace your IT exams.</p>    <p>Take this Exam Tips- Ace Your IT Exams  course and learn how to prepare for exams.</p>&lt;/p&gt;",
