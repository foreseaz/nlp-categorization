It's part of Amazon's <strong style=\"\">CLOUD</strong> offering called <strong style=\"\">AWS</strong>, another acronym which stand for <strong style=\"\">Amazon Web Services</strong>. </p><p><strong style=\"\">Performance tuning</strong> can be difficult enough with an on premise SQL Server. RDS complicates things further be adding another level of complexity. That complexity is that almost all of <strong style=\"\">our</strong> server level permissions and access have been removed. </p><p>In this course <strong style=\"\">WE</strong> will overcome these limitations by tailoring <strong style=\"\">OUR</strong> performance tuning approach specifically to RDS. Our <strong style=\"\">SOLE</strong> focus in this course will be strictly on RDS. </p><p>SQL Server is like a high performance sports car. Anyone can drive it but put it in the hands of a skilled <strong style=\"\">performance tuner and you've just gone from average to incredible</strong>. </p><p>This course will give <strong style=\"\">YOU</strong><strong style=\"\"> </strong>the foundation to become a skilled <strong style=\"\">PERFORMANCE TUNER</strong> on <strong style=\"\">RDS</strong>. The cloud has some nuances but SQL Server still relies on CPU, Memory and IO and that means <strong style=\"\">WE</strong> will simply have to alter our methodology slightly.</p><p>Once thought of as an art, performance tuning is nothing more than a <strong style=\"\">series of processes</strong><strong style=\"\"> </strong>that seek to accomplish <strong style=\"\">TWO basic goals</strong>.</p><p>The <strong style=\"\">FIRST</strong><strong style=\"\"> </strong>one is to reduce the <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">response time</em></strong><em style=\"\"> </em>for a given transaction or set of transactions.</p><p>The <strong style=\"\">SECOND</strong><strong style=\"\"> </strong>one is reduce <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">resource consumption</em></strong>. On the surface this sounds simple but nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>This course WILL provide <strong style=\"\">YOU </strong>with the foundation necessary to ensure data can be saved and retrieved so <strong style=\"\">YOUR </strong>RDS databases will have an organic flow of transactions.</p><p><strong style=\"\">ENROLL </strong>now. <strong style=\"\">Let's get started!!! </strong></p>",
