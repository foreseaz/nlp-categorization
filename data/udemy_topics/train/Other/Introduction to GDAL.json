Finally, you'll end by creating an Extraction, Translate, and Loading (ETL) tool with a single GDAL command (some people pay thousands of dollars just to complete this task!). </p><p>Like all my courses, I'll work alongside you so that you actually learn how to do his.  Be careful: after taking this course, you may never want to use a GIS GUI again.  </p>",
