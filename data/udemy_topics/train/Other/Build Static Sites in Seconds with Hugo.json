No more security updates, no MySQL, no PHP, just your content in HTML and CSS.  </p>  <p>  \t    I&#039;ll take you from downloading Hugo to creating or customizing a theme and then deploying your completed site to a standard web server, Amazon S3, Dropbox or Github pages. Learn how to streamline your process even further with time-saving shortcuts.  </p>  <p>  \t    The course consists of 20+ videos taking you step by step through the process of creating a site.  </p>  <p>  \t    Hugo makes the web fun again and after completing this course, you&#039;ll be able to join the fun.  </p>",
