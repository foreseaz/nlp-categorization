    "description": "<p>The aim of this course is to show you basic and advanced functions, their use, and some real-life example how to use it in your daily work/life. When I started learning Excel, I realized that it is very important to know Excel functions, but knowing them is not enough. You have to build it into your daily work and start thinking the way Excel \"thinks\". With this course I will focus on some real-life examples I had to face during my work and try to shed light on what Excel is capable of. The structure of the course includes some basics as well, so that if you do not have a strong basis, it still gives you guidance and a firm fund to continues and handle more complex problems. My aim is to show you how the functions work and then give you some tips how to use them. Moreover the videos are approaching from a point of view that can be useful at your workplace, e.g. automatization in handling structures, giving solutions for report generations. If you would like to save some time and spend less on sitting in front of a computer and handling data in Excel, then I recommend this course for you.</p><p><br></p>",
