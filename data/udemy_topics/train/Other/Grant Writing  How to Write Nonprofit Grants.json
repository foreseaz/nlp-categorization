    "description": "<p>Every nonprofit is unique. You are fighting for a specific, unique cause. You are serving a unique part of society, whether it be the dung beetles in Alaska or the homeless in Los Angeles. You have unique employees who are dedicated to your cause. You also have unique funding needs. Because there are so many things that make your organization unique, I want to help you tell your own story and apply for your own grants.</p><p>I have developed <strong>Grant Writing: How to Write Nonprofit Grants</strong> to cultivate your grant writing skills and empower you to write successful grants. There are millions of grants that you can apply for and quite a few foundations hardly receive any applications for their grants. This is money that could be accessed if you dedicate time to writing grants.</p><p>This course is designed with nonprofit organizations and their employees in mind. You will learn about the key aspects of a grant application, you will find grants that you can apply for, and you will go through the entire grant application process. </p><p>Your learning will be facilitated by video presentations, worksheets, quizzes, and assignments that will solidify the grant writing process and propel you towards getting funded. </p>",
