As a result, they stay at a basic level for longer than they should! This course was designed to help language learners avoid that altogether by using proven techniques and strategies to master the basics and reach higher levels of their target language.</p><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>Suitable for language learners who have already started learning their target language, the course starts with an introduction of suggested resources that the language learner can use in order to learn as effectively as possible. Language tutors and/or exchange partners are introduced and discussed, since they can provide good support for the student.</p><p>Additionally, the course introduces a method for the student to focus on learning what he or she wants and needs to express in the target language - which is a skill that, if mastered, can contribute significantly to the language learner's ability to communicate in the language. Moreover, the course focuses on how to use flashcards (either with a software or plain paper cue cards) for reviewing vocabulary effectively using \"spaced repetition\" - a popular and efficient learning method. The method of learning by association is also introduced as an alternative way to learn vocabulary.</p><p>The course also focuses on two fundamental skills required for any language learner to progress with confidence: reading and listening comprehension. We discuss what texts the student should read, and how to approach them in order to improve reading comprehension. Similarly (for listening comprehension), we introduce what students should listen to, and how to approach the content, in order to promote progress.</p><p>Finally, the course provides a concise overview of how to develop good pronunciation and learn grammar - two activities that language students often find challenging - without stress. To conclude the course, we discuss how to embrace the culture associated with the language in order to stay passionate and continuously promote progress through exposure. With the strategies and tools provided in the course, the language learner should be well equipped to master the basics and advance quickly in his or her target language.</p>",
