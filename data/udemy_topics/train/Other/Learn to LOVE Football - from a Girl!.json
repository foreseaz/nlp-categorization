    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>I love football, and I think a lot of girls - and other beginners - find it hard to learn the rules of the game by watching with a crowd of screaming maniacs.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                    I found myself at the center of many football parties, and especially Super Bowl parties, explaining to other women - and sometimes men, too - why everybody was screaming.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>    Well, this year I'm watching the game,</strong> because I've prepared this course for all my friends, and any beginners who would like to learn the game - so, everybody will know exactly what's going on.  </p>  <p>  \t                    I discuss everything from the very basics, Object of the Game, and Flow of the Game to strategies and rule changes.<br><br></p><p>And, I'll continue to add lectures and address issues on the game I love.<br></p>  <p>  \t  <strong>Also, I need to give a quick shout-out to Robert Scot, who provided incredible help developing this series - everything from helping the curriculum to video direction. This was my first time on camera, so I could never have done this without him. Check out his other course on Udemy!</strong>  </p>",
