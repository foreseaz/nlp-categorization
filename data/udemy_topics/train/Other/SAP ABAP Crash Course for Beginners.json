    "description": "<p>If you want to get started in the SAP area, mainly programming ABAP Reports, this is the perfect course for you because you will learn the nuts and bolts of SAP as well as how to write your first ABAP Reports.</p><p>Unlike other courses, we will not waste too much time on theory but dive deep into actually programming in SAP. We will be logged onto the system and create the programs step by step.</p><p>After we covered your first Hello World program you will also learn some advanced techniques like Database Access and Advanced List Output and using the Debugger to analyze how your programs run during runtime.</p><p>We will also take a look at the most common things that a SAP Developer has to deal with on a daily basis (Authorizations, Popups, Selection Screens, Arithmetical Calculations, Strings, Modularization Techniques, and much more). This gives you a good overview of what you can expect from being a ABAP Developer!<br></p>",
