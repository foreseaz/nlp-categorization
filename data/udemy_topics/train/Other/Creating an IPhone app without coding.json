    "description": "<p>The course covers the production of an iPhone app from start to finish.  The materials needed are: 1) Xcode (a free download from apple), 2) the website Buzztouch (free to sign up for) and 3) an apple computer. The course will take about 2 hours to complete and it is structured using a step by step approach going through 24 lessons. Each lesson is a screencast walking you through the necessary steps to complete one section of the app.  When the app is finished it will have screens that: 1) show websites 2) show directions to a location 3) display pictures via a powerpoint 4) allow the user to contact someone by email or text and 5) display videos accessing youtube. Other plug ins will be shown that are available from buzztouch. If you would like to see an app created with this material you can go to the app store, search for &quot;warren pettitt&quot; and download the app that I made for my wife&#039;s business.</p>",
