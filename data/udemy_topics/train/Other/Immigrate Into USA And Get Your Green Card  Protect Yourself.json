    "description": "<p style=\"\">I'm the first generation immigrant, I went to USA law school (Juris Doctor Program) and worked with one of the best immigration lawyers before. I hired and fired immigration lawyers myself. I witnessed a lot of tragedies that was preventable. I saw dead cases went back to life, I saw cases that was dead beyond repair.</p><p style=\"\">This course is not to teach you how to do it yourself. U.S. Immigration law is treacherous and tricky. In my job I helped filed multiple complaints against other immigration lawyers being negligent, some of them in business for over 20 years, so you know I can't teach you to do it yourself because it's often case by case, one tick in the wrong box your case might be dead.</p><p style=\"\">Although the actual legal process will be done by a lawyer, in real life tons of people still get screwed up even if they hired a lawyer due to their inexperience and lack of information back to their home country and there is no way they can learn these information and prepare ahead of the time from any channel. </p><p style=\"\">This course helps you to make informed decision, get prepared, and help you to protect yourself.</p>",
