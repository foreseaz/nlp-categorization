Email has become the productivity bane of modern corporate employees, the ball-and-chain that keeps them stuck at their desks for hours every day. They wade around, desperately trying to sort, respond to, and organize messages. Pending items fall through the cracks. Email for long-term projects sit in the inbox and collect dust. Employees hit &quot;Reply to All&quot; to 17 people and create hundreds of &quot;Me too!&quot; responses that add nothing to the conversation and waste everyone&#039;s time. ENOUGH! Take this course and get and stay on top of your email, once and for all.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>You&#039;ll get four one-hour video lectures, a workbook with scree shots and step-by-step instructions, an MP3, and 2 eBooks by Productivity Pro, Laura Stack, Certified Microsoft Application Specialist in Outlook. Go to <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.TheProductivityPro.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.TheProductivityPro.com</a> for more information.</div>",
