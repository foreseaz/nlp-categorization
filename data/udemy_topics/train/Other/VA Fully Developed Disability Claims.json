The Veteran&#039;s Administration (VA) has designed a system to quickly get you the financial and health benefits you deserve! Using this new system will cut benefit(s) wait time from years to just a few months.</p><p style=\"\">The Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program is a new initiative that offers Veterans and survivors faster decisions from VA on compensation, pension, and survivor benefit claims.</p><p style=\"\">Veterans and survivors simply submit all relevant records in their possession, and those records which are easily obtainable, such as private medical records, at the time they make their claim and certify that they have no further evidence to submit. VA can then review and process the claim more quickly.</p>",
