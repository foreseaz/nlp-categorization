If you are one of them maybe it also happened to you to see a competitor with lower quality products and services, but... people just know about him. It seems he is anywhere on the internet.</p>  <p>And you are not alone. There are thousands of coaches, instructors, trainers and instructors (<strong>Udemy instructors</strong> included here) in the same case. </p>  <p>And they need a website looking amazing and working fast. </p>  <p>But <strong>they don’t know how to build it.</strong></p>  <p>In this letter I will show you probably the easiest way to have a Wordpress Website in literally minutes and to also manage it succcessfully in minutes, without any coding.</p>  <p>Even if you are not a technical geek!</p>  <p>You cand do this for yourself or - as many of my clients did – you can develop a business in creating Wordpress Websites for million of businesses out there in need for a website.</p>  <p>Before that, let me introduce myself:</p>  <p>My name is Florin Rosoga, I am a online business consultant, coach and author. I started using online tools like Wordpress blogs, social media, email marketing, podcasring and webinars several years ago to promote my books and consulting services. Like many other people I thought that by posting on a blog, on Facebook or Twitter people will notice me and I will get customers.</p>  <p>But that didn't happen at all.</p>  <p>They continued to ... just ignore me.</p>  <p>It wasn't that long ago when nobody seemed to care about what I had to offer. I was frustrated and couldn't understand why other people that seemed to have inferior products and services could thrive, while I was stuck.</p>  <p>I decided to change that and the moment when things turned in a different direction was when I finally understood how do people really behave, read and spend time online.</p>  <p>I called it the <strong>Online Behavioral Routines</strong></p>  <p>From that moment I applied what I learned to my own blog, my own social media pages, my own podcast each time with more and more success. I applied the same techniques and strategies I thought my clients and they... got same professional results.</p>  <p>In 2015 just one of my blogs will be visited by 5 Million people.

So, I had to learn to play with the bricks and actually started enjoying, great game. And each time I start with some bricks, add some other, change, add, improve and build upon what I already have.</p>  <p>You start with something, you get new bricks and build it further. The same with this training.</p>  <p>This course will give you everything you need to get results with your blog.</p>  <p>But still there are a few things missing. You will have <strong>drawbacks</strong>, problems, things that will not work. And, I am sure, you'll find issues I didn't covered in the course.</p>  <p>So I added <strong><u>the SUPERLEGO BONUS</u></strong> that will give you the exact bricks you need to build your game. Basically, you get with this bonus as much value as with the entire course:</p>  <ul><li><strong>24 hours, 7 days per week assistance</strong> to any question you have.

I hope what I will teach you when you will start the course will help you make a huge performance leap! <strong>Click now on TAKE THIS COURSE </strong>to get started!<span></span></p>  <p><strong><u>P.P.S.</u></strong> The price is the lowest price I can afford to go with and include all the bonuses. The bonuses alone are over $300 value. All the mistakes that you will do by trying yourself to see what works and what not, all the time lost with things that just just do not work will cost you <strong>thousands of dollars over the next years</strong>. As it costed me.</p>  <p>You can still wait, hoping you will find an easy way, hoping to learn by trial and error, hoping that customers will like your website and that you won't make mistakes... but well <strong>hope is not a good plan at all</strong>. In fact, it's the worst plan and strategy you can follow. <strong>Stop hoping t</strong>hings will work by themselves and<strong> start changing that today</strong>.</p>  <p>Postponing this for one day means continuing to struggle for years. <strong>Stop struggling today and start getting amazing and professional looking websites</strong>! The same way your competitors already probably do it.</p>  <p><strong><u>P.P.P.S. </u></strong>Since usually my courses quickly become popular, I cannot offer the same feedback, assistence and especially the blog coaching I offer now as a bonus to the students that bought this course. I just don't have the time!</p>  <p>So, in a couple of days, I intend to <strong>withdraw these bonuses </strong>and offer the Wordpress 2015 Masterclass course alone, without them. If you want to get the course with all the bonuses, <strong>act now and make sure you order it</strong>.</p>",
