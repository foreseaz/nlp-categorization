You'll enjoy the animations, the sound clips, it's not just someone talking, or a talking head per se, you'll see excerpts of video clips, and such that are introduced, in an entertaining manner. I always strive for my information to be clear concise and fun to listen to. I promise you will want to handle food in a completely different manner after you take my course. Try it!, and have fun!. </p>",
