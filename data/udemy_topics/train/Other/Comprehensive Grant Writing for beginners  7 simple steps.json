We review several resources (international) that list available Grants, and learn how to find even more Grants.  </p>  <p>  \t    The course is hands-on and process oriented. Those taking the course will have the tools and preparation to apply for a number of grants.  </p>  <p>  \t    The legal and ethical information applies to Canada and the United States, but also has applications internationally.  </p>  <p>  \t    Karen Young has been a fundraising professional, and an author of books on the topic of fundraising.  </p>",
