    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course will teach you IFTTT. IFTTT, a free service that automates repetitive tasks. If you are not learning IFTTT, you are missing all the good stuff! It&#039;s beautiful and creative!!   IFTTT is comparable to a virtual worker: It puts the internet to work, and does your tasks.     The concepts covered in this course are for intermediate internet users, thus, having a fair knowledge of internet helps: isn&#039;t a compulsion. I have covered the topics in easy to understand terms so that beginners can understand. Intermediate users who were not aware of this service will learn how to deal with routine tasks quickly and efficiently. The course consists of series of videos. This course is short for now.     We begin by looking at absolute basics such as how to open the website, how to find information that&#039;s needed, and continue to follow step by step approach till you learn enough.     You must take this course to learn automating stuff on internet, and to save your time and efforts. By the time of completion of this course I promise you will be 5-20% more productive than you currently are.  </p>",
