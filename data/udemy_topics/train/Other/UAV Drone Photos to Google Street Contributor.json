    "description": "<p>This course is for drone pilots (or soon to be drone pilots) that want to learn how to take photos that will be stitched together into one, near 360 degree panoramic shot that can be shared with the world through Google Streets.  I fumbled through the process when I first started and I wanted to share what I learned in the process.  This process will be demonstrated using a DJI Phantom 3 Professional, a Samsung S6 phone, and a PC laptop, but almost all of what will be discussed can be applied to any photo-taking UAV and devices.  Learn how to share unique locations with the world in stunning detail!  Adding photos (contributing) to Google Maps is easier with the Android App, but can be done without the app with some restrictions.</p>",
