    "description": "<p>In this course we cover programming the low cost Numato Elbert V2 FPGA development board with the Xilinx Spartan 3A chip.  Using the free Xilinx ISE webpack IDE software we program multiple examples in both Verilog and VHDL.  Besides coding and interfacing the on-board peripherals like the 7-segment display, DIP switches, buttons, LEDs, and audio we also externally prototype some simple examples using Servo and Stepper motors, LCDs and character displays.  All examples are done with inexpensive components that are easy to acquire and interface.</p><p>This course will help the practicing engineer get up to speed with the basics of FPGA's.  It's also well suited for the advanced engineering student interested in digital design, and is appropriate for the technologically savvy hobbyist wanting to gain knowledge of configurable logic in an effort to expand their designs.<br></p><p>We will be going throigh examples including:</p><p>1. LEDs 2. switches 3. buttons 4 seven segment display 5. GPIO's 5 audio 7. Stepper motor 8. servo motor 9. LCD  10. other examples</p><p><br></p><p>Limited time:  course is $9, will go up to $19soon..  Remember you can get your money back if unhappy with the course.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
