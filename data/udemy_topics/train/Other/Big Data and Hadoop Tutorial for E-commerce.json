It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.</p>  <p>This brief tutorial provides a quick introduction to Big Data, MapReduce algorithm, and Hadoop Distributed File System with the help of an e-commerce specific example.</p>  <p>Hadoop framework allows the user to quickly write and test distributed systems. It is efficient, and it automatically distributes the data and work across the machines and in turn, utilizes the underlying parallelism of the CPU cores.</p>  <p>Another big advantage of Hadoop is that apart from being open source, it is compatible on all the platforms since it is Java based.</p>  <p>We will also cover Enterprise Data Warehouse and Hadoop ecosystems and the practical concepts involved in handling very large data sets.</p>    <p>About the instructor:<br> The instructor Durga Gadiraju, has a 12+ years of experience in IT. He has been associated with several fortune clients such as Wal-Mart, IBM, AT&amp;T,Dell, etc.</p>",
