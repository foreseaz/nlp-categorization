Integration includes incorporation of geological information, seismic, petrophysical and dynamic data. Practical methodology of the best practices and troubleshooting of 3D reservoir characterization in the light of geo-statistics are covered in each step of geo-modeling processes.</p><p>Process of data handling, importing, editing, quality controlling, quantitative analysis and constraining the results of modeling algorithms in the steps of picking, fault modeling, gridding, generating horizons, zoning, layering and property modeling are captured by using different tools and plots. </p>",
