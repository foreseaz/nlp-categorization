    "description": "<p>This course is about the fundamental concepts of machine learning, facusing on neural networks. This topic is getting very hot nowadays because these learning algorithms can be used in several fields from software engineering to investment banking. Learning algorithms can recognize patterns which can help detect cancer for example. We may construct algorithms that can have a very very good guess about stock prices movement in the market.</p><p>In the first chapter we are going to talk about the basics of the R programming language. Later, we will talk about neural networks in the main, and the theory behind it. The last chapter is about the concrete examples of neural networks.</p>",
