This enables web developers to use many of the features of server-side Content Management Systems (like templates, themes, and blog-awareness) while taking advantage of the speed, security, and simplicity of static sites. Plus, this mighty little Ruby script lives on both your computer and on GitHub&#039;s servers, which means you get super-fast hosting that&#039;s only a `git push` away, and free for you and all your collaborators!  </p>",
