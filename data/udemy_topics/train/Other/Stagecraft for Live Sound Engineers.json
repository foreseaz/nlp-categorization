You will need some experience on or around stages,understand basic signal flow in live sound - the difference between inputs and outputs, what satellite or sub boxes and monitors are - and that your job as a sound engineer is to provide a stage which makes it easy for the artist to perform.</p><p>The course consists of 16 videos which will take just over an hour to complete, but which will change your working life as a live sound engineer.<br></p>",
