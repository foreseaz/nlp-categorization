    "description": "<p>The objective of this course is to understand how to efficiently and accurately apply ESD protection from an analog/mixed signal IC designers viewpoint.  The approach will be to understand ESD protection cells, understand ESD influence on circuit components, apply a co-design approach to combining ESD protection with analog/mixed signal circuits<span>, understand the physical aspects of ICs on ESD, and to avoid common mistakes in ESD protection.</span></p>  <p>The terminology used in this course is that found in analog and mixed-signal IC design practice.  An understanding of integrated circuit components; transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc., is assumed.</p><p>The course consist of 16 lectures with a quiz following each lecture.  The course will take approximately 10 hours to complete including the quizzes.</p><p>This course should be taken by analog and/or mixed signal designers who want to be able to efficiently and effectively provide ESD protection for their designs.</p>",
