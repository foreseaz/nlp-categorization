We intend to teach the new 8 domains of security of the (ISC)2 Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) in 8 individual courses rather than one entire course so you only pay for the courses or sections you need to brush up or review on. </p><p>Since you only need 70% correct answers to pass we suggest you become proficient in at least 6 of the 8 domains to pass, rather than try to focus on on all the domains. </p><p>We recommend to use the Sybex CISSP book, 7th edition, but you can you other book(s) as well.</p>",
