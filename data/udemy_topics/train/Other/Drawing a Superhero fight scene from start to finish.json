My name is Luis and IÂ´m really excited to have the opportunity to share with you the process I follow when I create a complete rendered pencil drawing, specifically when I draw a superhero character. In this course you will learn several techniques that you can apply when you want to draw superheroes. Actually you can apply these techniques to virtually any drawing you make. I will show you how use a drawing plan by dividing the process into logical steps. I divided the course into several videos that correspond to every stage. </p><p>It is very important to know the drawing theory though at the same time it is true that drawing is a physical activity that requires learning through observation and practice.</p>",
