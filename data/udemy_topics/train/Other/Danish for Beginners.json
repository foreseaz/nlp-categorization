However, it does require a structured approach and consistency.  </p>  <p style=\"\">The course is divided into 7 weeks to provide structure and allow you time to absorb the topic of each lecture without sacrificing the pace of the course. Every week consists of 3 video lectures, with supplementary materials that reinforce the concepts you have learned. </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        You are welcome to work your way through the course faster or slower than the suggested 7 weeks. However, make sure that you move at a fast enough pace to allow you to retain what you have learned, and slow enough that you have time to internalize what is being taught and commit it to your long-term memory.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        My goal with this course is for you to learn Danish and be able to use it when you are done! </p><p style=\"\">Additionally, since Danish is one of the Scandinavian languages it is very similar to both Swedish and Norwegian. Taking this course will thereby not only help you be able to communicate with native Danes, but also with most Swedes and Norwegians. </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">This is what you can expect:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">7 weeks of engaging learning material, including videos, texts, tests and other exercises.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">22 lectures and over 2 hours of video content.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Simple, fun and easy-to-understand lectures.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Captivating exercises that let you test your comprehension.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Considerable vocabulary training and grammar instruction to build your conversational skills.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">A 30-day full refund guarantee, no questions asked.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">And last but not leastâ€¦ to learn Danish!</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Are you ready?
