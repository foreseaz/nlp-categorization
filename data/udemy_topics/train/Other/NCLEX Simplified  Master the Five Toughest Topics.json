    "description": "<p>  \t  After watching her classmates struggle to study for their NCLEX, Lisa realized that there had to be a better way- and so she made it! NCLEX Simplified holds only the core information you need to pass the test, with none of the information you don&#039;t. Students who have studied under Lisa have a 100% pass rate on the NCLEX! Join them today and get your RN or LPN. Hard work in this course really does pay off, and you&#039;ll feel ready to become the nurse you&#039;ve always dreamed of being!  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \tThis is the quick and dirty version of the course- we&#039;re going to discuss Endocrine, Maternity, Neonate, Pediatrics, and Medications like you&#039;ve never heard them before. This is NOT a substitute for a full NCLEX Review, but it sure is better than Kaplan!  </p>",
