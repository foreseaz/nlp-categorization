Studies show that 87% of a person's earning potential is directly linked to public speaking skills</p><blockquote><em>Paul has a knack for engaging audiencesâ€“and teaching others how to do the same. He makes the difficult seem doable by providing simples, practical steps. </em><br>Erin Casey, \teditor, Success Magazine</blockquote><p><strong>SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC SPEAKING CONSISTS OF 3 ELEMENTS...</strong></p><p><em>1. CONTENT.</em></p><p>A message packed with practical, easy to remember, and useful information. It must be memorable and portable.</p><p><em>2. CONFIDENCE.</em></p><p>Knowing that what you share will be valuable and useful, and that you are the one to share it.</p><p><em>3. CONNECTION.</em></p><p>You must be able to draw the audience into the message. That's what brings the laughter, the tears, the standing ovations.</p><p>Not only will the combination of those three erase your fear, they will keep you from being dull and boring. And whatever you do - don't be dull and boring. Nothing's worse than looking into the audience's eyes...and they're closed!</p><p><strong>Stop Saying \"No\" When You Are Asked to Speak</strong></p><p>Get this system today and accept speaking engagements immediately. The reason most people turn down an opportunity to speak is fear. They're afraid of not knowing what to say, or how to say it. That does not have to be you.</p><p>Public Speaking Mastery erases your excuses. It's practical, relevant, and real. These common questions will be answered:</p><p>1. Is it really possible to speak without being scared?</p><p>2. How do I find information on the subject?</p><p>3. How do I know what material to use?</p><p>4. How do I organize all this information?</p><p>5. Where do I find good illustrations, examples, stories, statistics and other supporting resources - that are good, not the hokey stuff in most books?</p><p>6. What do I talk about?</p><p>7. Should I use notes, memorize my talk, or what?</p><p>You'll get those questions answered <u>and a lot more</u>.</p><p><strong>WARNING: DO NOT BUY ANY BOOK OR COURSE ON PUBLIC SPEAKING UNLESS IT MEETS THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA...</strong></p><p><strong>ONE: It is written by a true professional speaker.</strong> Too many courses and books are from theorists who write about speaking, but don't actually speak. You want a practitioner who speaks to thousands each year on subjects more than just public speaking.</p><p><strong>TWO: Shows you step by step how to develop, design, and deliver YOUR message.</strong> Don't be conned by someone who wants to \"sell you a fish,\" without teaching you how to catch them for yourself.</p><p><strong>THREE: Explains why certain speaking techniques work, not just that they work.</strong> Knowing why helps you understand the reason behind a practice. Without \"why\" you'll never reach your full speaking potential.</p><p><strong>FOUR: You can actually talk with the author or developer.</strong> Unreachable people have no accountability for their product.</p><blockquote>I wanted to tell you that I enjoyed Public Speaking Mastery. I have been speaking and presenting seminars for about 5 years now, mostly as a lead generation tool for my marketing consulting business and products, but I got a lot out of your material.<br><br>Having that experience actually allows me to relate more rapidly to the material in your course. (When you make a point about something not working I can say, Oh, that's why that bombed last week.) The most beneficial part for me was the help in constructing a talk.<br><br>Look forward to the next release. I have decided, mostly due to demand, that I need to start making direct income from my speaking as well.<br>- John Jantsch, \tDuct Tape Marketing</blockquote><p><strong>GREAT SPEAKERS AREN'T BORN... THEY'RE BUILT!</strong><span></span></p><p>I've been speaking as a professional for 31 years. But speaking did not come naturally for me. Possibly like you, I sat in the audience listening to great speakers wishing for that ability.</p><p>I was asked to give a speech, but was scared...terrified. What about getting embarrassed? What if something stupid comes out? What about a mess up? You know what I'm talking about.</p><p>Then I began to study speaking. Checked out every book at the library on the subject. Cleaned out the local bookstores. Shelled out hard earned cash for seminars from the masters. Began giving talks to church youth groups. Then to civic groups. But I still didn't have a clue about what I was doing. Sometimes it went well, and sometimes it bombed. But I kept going - kept studying and kept learning the secrets of effective communication.</p><p>Now I speak to thousands upon thousands of people each year. I speak to multi-million and billion dollar companies. It's not an accident. There's a reason I get invited to speak to these groups. And I don't go in and tell them how to speak. I share subjects that will motivate their people and pump up their profits.</p><p>This speaker's education has been a long (<em>tens of thousands of dollars</em>) learning curve that proved valuable. Now I want to help you - if you'll let me. You'll get the very same formula I use to build captivating messages. You can't believe what a solid message will do for your confidence.</p><p><strong>SPEAK WITH PASSION, OR JUST LEAVE ME A NOTE!</strong><span></span></p><p>It's time to speak with confidence and share your message. This course provides everything you need to design and deliver unforgettable messages.</p><p>Paul B Evans</p>",
