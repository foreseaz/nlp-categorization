    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Perfectionism</em></strong> is a painful way to live.  It is a cage that takes away freedom; it is a load of bricks on the back that reduces performance.  A perfectionist is critical of everyone.  Nothing is ever good enough, especially one’s own performance.  When perfectionists win, to them it feels like a loss anyway.  “I could have done better,” they tell themselves.  </p>  <p>  \t     It is a painful way to live—or to live close to—but it does not have to be that way.  Dr. Rich Walters, experienced therapist and author of <em style=\"\">The Perfectionism Trap and How to Escape, </em>explains clearly how you can exchange the burden of perfectionism for the joys of excellence.  </p>  <p>  \t     This course prepares you to <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">change what you need to change.  </em></strong>To swap the agony of over-reach for the joy of grasping success.  The course combines video mini-lectures (you gain knowledge) with activities to improve your own circumstances (these help you use the knowledge) .  Along with the video coaching, you will invest some time to think and plan.  The potential payback is great; it is worth doing it well.  </p>",
