    "description": "<p style=\"\">I&#039;ve identified a few techniques and important areas from 45 years of piano playing experience, which may shorten the time necessary to become proficient at composing a piano arrangement.  This course consists of a survey of chords to create an emotional atmosphere in your arrangements.  Then, I reveal some &quot;tricks to the trade&quot; that I&#039;ve found helpful in making my own arrangements through the years.  We will discuss and practice some textures that will complement the emotional language of the arrangements that you will create.  As we progress, there will be some basic projects, which you can discuss with me through Udemy.  To guarantee that this can be accomplished, I am committed to help you develop your arranging skill through the Udemy contact methods.</p>",
