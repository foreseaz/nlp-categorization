    "description": "<p>  \t    When I was about to be a parent for the first time I was lucky.  My wife already had 2 kids so I got the scoop on everything, it was a nice smooth financial transition for me because she had already been through it.  I want to share some secrets with you so that you can have the same success I did.  In this class one of my recommendations actually saved me over $1,000 / month, and I know I can save you some money.  I know in shopping for clothes alone we saved a ton with the tricks I tell you about in this course.  So please pull up some popcorn and lets get down to some kid hacks that will give you a nice smooth transition into parenthood.  </p>  <p>  \t    Congratulations by the way on being a parent.  It has been one of the most joy filled things I have ever done. My son who is now 2 years 3 months is the best thing hands down to ever come into my life.  I hope you have the same experience.  </p>",
