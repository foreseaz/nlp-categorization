The course will focus on the Ubuntu 14.04 Server flavour of Linux, running as either a Virtual Machine or an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance.  </p><p>In the case of the Ubuntu Virtual Machine, I&#039;ll demonstrate how things are done using VMWare, but the steps and approach will be applicable to other hypervisors such as VirtualBox</p><p>For the Linux user and EWDjs newbie, this course is an ideal pre-cursor to my other beginner&#039;s course: &quot;Getting Started with EWDjs&quot;.  Whilst the latter course focuses on developing using a Windows platform, there&#039;s really no difference in development approach apart from file path syntax. </p><p></p>",
