The lectures are short, detailed, and to the point, with a focus on the knowledge that tends to be tested in the AKT. Each lecture also comes with a quiz to help you cement your learning. Take this course, and you'll find that you quickly develop a reasonable working knowledge of everything you need to know to be a good GP (along with some of the pointless stuff you need to know to pass the exam). </p>",
