It is for absolute beginners who have not yet used their Pi and covers very first installations, through to using the desktop environment, up to the basics of programming in Scratch and Python.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the course you will have a much better grip on your new mini computer, and will be able to confidently pursue greater goals using it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I try to <strong>communicate</strong> with my students as much as possible! If you have a question I'm always available to <strong>ask! </strong>And I'll try my best to solve your problem; <strong>programming or otherwise.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I believe in <strong>quality over quantity</strong>, I try to keep my lectures <strong>short and concise</strong> so you can take it all in, and easily refer back to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in <strong>crisp 1080p</strong>, and each section comes with <strong>written material</strong> to recap what you've learned. <strong>This truly is one of the best ways to learn.</strong></p>",
