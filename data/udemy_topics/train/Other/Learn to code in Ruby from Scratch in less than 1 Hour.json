To begin with we will examine the basic object types in Ruby as well as fundamentals of the language syntax. We will learn how an object-oriented programming works and I will walk you through the steps that enable us to read and write to a file in your code. Finally at the end of the course I will ask to perform a simple program to find prime, even and odd numbers between a range of values and you will have to use File handling syntax to get the starting and ending values of the range. Now it doesn&#039;t matter if you are a beginner and you don&#039;t have prior experience we will all the fundamentals you need. And if you are interested in web-development you will end up having basic knowledge of Ruby that will help you use it in making websites using Ruby on Rails.</span>  </p>",
