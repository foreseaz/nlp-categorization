    "description": "<p>Part two of Sexual Addiction takes a look at how shame perpetuates addiction.  It also explores how the family of origin has an impact on attachment connections and wounds. </p><p>This course contains a series of lectures, each building on the lecture previously. Students explore the concept of attachment wounds, core emotions, shadows of shame, and ways of healing from destructive core messages.  </p><p>This course helps students, particularly those struggling with sexual addiction, or the loved ones of those struggling, to have a better understanding of how attachment wounds contribute to addictive behaviors.</p><p>The course takes about three hours if the student takes the class all at once. This course does not take the place of therapy. However it does provide an excellent starting point for recovery to begin.</p><p>Do not delay healing any longer. Enroll today.</p>",
