    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course explores the way in which couples find themselves disconnected in their relationship.  It is based on 30 years of research by Sue Johnson, the founder of Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy.  The course takes a look at how couples engage in similar patterns of behavior when they are emotionally wounded as a way of coping with how they feel.  Often times, these patterns lead to disconnection rather than desired closeness.</p><p style=\"\">The course will take a few hours to complete.  Students will be given handouts along with the course that they can use to discuss the principles taught with their partner. </p><p style=\"\">The course contains a collection of short educational videos that outline ways to build deeper connection and the barriers to connection. </p><p style=\"\">If you or a loved one is affected by addiction in your relationship, this course will help you to have a better understanding of steps that can be taken to begin the healing process.</p>",
