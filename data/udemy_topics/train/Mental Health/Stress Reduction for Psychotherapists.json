    "description": "<p>  \t      &quot;Stress Reduction for Psychotherapists&quot; is intended to help the practicing psychotherapist (licensed or intern) with managing and releasing the physical and mental stress that unavoidably comes with doing this work.  It is taught in video form, broken into sections for work between sessions and during sessions, but all focusing on using the breath and body to reduce stress.  (The course will take you about one hour and twenty minutes to watch all the way through, but we recommend going slowly and experimenting with the different exercises.  As this course uses the body so much, we encourage you to consult your physician to make sure it&#039;s all safe for your body.  The information is intended to be educational, and we cannot take responsibility for any injuries.  Use your medical person and good common sense.)  </p>",
