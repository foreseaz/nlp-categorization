    "description": "<p>The Lose the Baby Weight course is for moms with \"babies\" of any age who are ready to get their confidence, happiness, and pre-baby body back. Whether you are newly post-partum, breastfeeding, have other kids, or just can't seem to shake your muffin top, this course will give the most effective ways to get fit and lose the baby weight.</p><p>As a dietitian, I cover the importance of good nutrition in fat loss and give many examples of healthy foods and meals I use. I also discuss strength training as a primary form of exercise (be sure you have your doctor's clearance before beginning any exercise program). I will explain why building muscles is more effective than any exercise in building a lean, sexy physique. I will demystify the weight room and which muscles to work, when, and show you how to \"spot reduce\" to get your best body ever.</p><p>The course consists mostly of videos of me teaching, but there are also slides, helpful handouts (like a sample workout plan and my top 50+ skinny foods that I must have on hand to be successful), and homework with extra resources (relevant YouTube videos and helpful articles).</p><p>There are 6 main sections with mini lectures in each, so the course can be completed in about 2-4 weeks.</p><p>Section 1 is an Overview of How to Lose the Baby Weight.
