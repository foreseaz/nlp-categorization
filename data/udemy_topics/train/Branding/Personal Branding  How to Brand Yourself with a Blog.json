    "description": "<p><strong>UPDATED WITH SEVEN (7) NEW SECTION RECAPS</strong></p><p>4,500. That's the number of marketing messages we each are exposed to on a daily basis. Yeah, that's a lot. But, when you consider the number of bumper stickers, billboards, television ads, logos, emblems, brand characters, products, radio spots, and social media, just to name a few, that we are exposed to, this number is actually plausible. </p><p>What this overexposure really means is an already crowded market is becoming even noisier each day. </p><p><strong>Turn Up the Silence</strong>Well, all of this noise creates a really big problem: Unless you are a recognized brand, whether product or personal, you and your message will get lost. And that's not good. You see, prospective clients, customers, fans, and patients can't find you. In fact, they don't even know that you exist. Yeah, it's a jungle - a jungle where only brands will survive.</p><p><strong>The Death of Your </strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Business </strong>See, brands stand out, or survive, because they have created the right product and message, for the right audience, and delivers them at just the right time. As such, they avoid the slow death of the non-brand - becoming an undifferentiated commodity. And when you are a commodity, everything is about a low price. In other words, you can't command higher fees and get paid what you're worth. </p><p><strong>How to Stand Out from the Crowd</strong>Well, in order to change this eventual fate, you must stand out from the crowd by becoming a recognized brand. But that's easier said than done. You have to find the ideal audience and consistently offer value that will connect with them emotionally. Huh, that's really hard to do. Perhaps that's why so few actually do connect with their audience.</p><p><strong>We Know the Blueprint</strong>Well, the good news is, there are those who have built powerful personal brands and stand out in any market. And the better news is, we have participated directly in creating some of these brands. Translation: We know the exact steps you need to take to make it to the top of your market. </p><p>In this course, you're going to learn how to use a blog to break through the noise, connect emotionally with an eager audience, and build a world-class brand. </p><p><strong>Here is some of what you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li>Why a blog is the ideal tool for connecting with your audience</li><li>The six (6) elements of a powerful brand and how to easily implement them</li><li>How to create a product (you) that your target will naturally gravitate towards</li><li>The four (4) steps in developing an emotionally charged brand story</li><li>How to identity those people (target) who are automatically attracted to your message</li><li>What causes your target to seek you out and want to do business with you</li><li>How to create raving fans that will spend money and spread the word about you</li><li>And, much, much more.</li></ul><p>Are you ready to go from blog to brand?
