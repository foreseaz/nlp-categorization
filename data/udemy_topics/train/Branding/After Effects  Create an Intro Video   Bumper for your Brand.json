    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> Watch any professional commercial, YouTube channel, or television series, and one thing they all have in common is that they have a video intro! You know? That 5-10 second animation with their logo?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              These video intros (or video bumpers as many people call them in the video industry) are eye-catching, brand-strengthening, and audience-growing. Anybody that ever watched television can remember McDonald&#039;s ba da ba ba ba jingle and logo fading onto the screen. Most great YouTube channels have a short intro bumper, and these creators are sometimes making a living off of the videos they post online.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> I believe everyone with a brand, a YouTube channel, or any other sort of video production NEEDS to have a video intro.</strong> And I believe anyone is capable of creating their own! You don&#039;t have to pay someone else to do it for you. This course will teach you everything you need to know to create an elegant and professional video intro for your brand.  </p>  <p>  \t              The course is taught in Adobe After Effects CC. If you have another version of After Effects, that is totally fine. If you don&#039;t, you can get a free 30-day trial of After Effects from Adobe.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"> Topics Covered:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Video Intro Theory</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Conceptualizing Your Video Intro</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Recreating Video Intros</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Video Intros in After Effects</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Using the Video Intro Properly</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Exporting Your Video Intro</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">more!</strong></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t              All course materials are downloadable for viewing on any device.
