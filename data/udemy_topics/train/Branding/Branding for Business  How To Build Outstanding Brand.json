They just don't exist and those who say that, simple lie. Period. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">So, I am not another marketing \"guru\" teaching you how to build 6 figures business in a record time. I might even disappoint you, but I haven't reached 6 figures by myself. However, by this time,</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I've significantly contributed to reach 7 figures by others companies working as a brand consultant - check out my PORTFOLIO (lecture No. 3, 30) and my story in bio section below. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I created this course to show you, that it is POSSIBLE to build a successful physical product brand without having big budget (still need money though) and I will prove that by showing you how it's done based on real life case studies. However, again, rather than ready solution, you're supposed to get the right mindset, find an inspiration and learn TOP strategies &amp; techniques, that will help you to grow your brand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I don't want to bore you with long marketing messages so simply watch the promo &amp; free preview videos and decide whether this course meets your specific needs. I'm happy to have you on board and enjoy our branding journey together!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. Ohh, did I forget to mention, that I offer ONE FREE personal advice for all of my students? ;-)</p>",
