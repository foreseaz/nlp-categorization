Instead of the daily grind and stress of trying to keep things on course, imagine running projects that <strong>surprise customers by delivering regular value that customers can use</strong>, <strong>earlier than they expected.</strong></p><p>I have devised this approach, from over 20 years experience of delivering complex projects and from in-depth research into project success and failure. It's <strong>my personal recipe for success and you will not find it anywhere else</strong>, either in courses or in books.</p><p>Conventional project management approaches pretend that projects are predictable. They focus on delivering lists of milestones or software releases that don't actually deliver any real, usable business value. In contrast, <strong>Lean Project Management recognises that projects are inherently unpredictable</strong> and structures your project to deliver, regular, usable business value throughout the project, not just at the end.</p><p>The approach that I teach in this course is <strong>applicable to all types of projects</strong> but is <strong>particularly useful for IT-based projects</strong>. This is because the output of an IT-based project is less tangible and less easy to define than something like a bridge. But equally, IT is more flexible than a bridge and thus lending itself to a lean approach.</p><p>The course is delivered as series of bite-sized videos, with accompanying notes and references. </p><p>In total there is around 2 hours of video lectures and 17 straightforward exercises that ask you to apply what you have learned to â€œyour own project\". For those without a project they can used, a suggested \"case study\" is provided. </p><p>There are also 4 optional lectures that add an additional 35 minutes of value to keen learners.</p><p>Ask yourself this questions: how do projects get to be a year late? </p><p>The answer is: one day at a time.<br></p><p><em><strong>Don't let tomorrow be one of those days - sign up now and take advantage of the the 30-day money back guarantee.</strong></em><br></p>",
