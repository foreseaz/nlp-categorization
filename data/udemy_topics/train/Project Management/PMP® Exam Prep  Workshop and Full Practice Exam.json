    "description": "<p>NEW COURSE MAY 2016!</p>\n\n<p>This is a different approach to preparing for the PMP® exam.  There are two main sections:</p>\n\n<p>The first part contains practical assignments in all 10 Knowledge Areas that you need to download and complete based on what you know or using PMBOK® to retrieve the information.  After each assignment is complete you view the video that explains the answer.  The purpose of the assignments is to help you review and remember key concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The next part is the full PMP® practice exams.   There are two exams containing 200 questions each and they are proportionally representative of the process groups based on the actual PMP® exam content.  You need to pass all 5 process groups in order to pass the exam!  This practice will make sure you are prepared in <strong>EACH PROCESS AREA.  </strong>Do not be a student who fails the PMP® exam because you only passed 4 process groups.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is essential for anyone planning to write the PMP exam regardless of any other course you take. It provides incredible value and was created in 2018 so it contains the most current material. Enroll now! You need this course!</p>",
