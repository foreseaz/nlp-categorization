The price will increase as the content increases. ***</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Join this course and learn a complete different approach to project management.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to save you hundreds of hours being frustrated with the old traditional project management methods. Especially if you figured out already that PMP, PRINCE2 and IPMA certifications will not necessarily help you reach project milestones because most of the classical methods are either not really applicable or you are not told how exactly to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key of successful project management is not memorizing dozens of models and processes: the key is organizing yourself while motivating and communicating with others.</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to give you genuine advice and tools to set up your projects and deliver them on time and in quality. I will tell you enough of my best practices to outperform most traditional project managers you know.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I have been a project manager for around 10 years and delivered dozens of projects on time and in quality. I also took many classes / am certified on project management (PRINCE2) and other areas of expertise (i.e. ITIL, TOGAF). </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>However, the problem is that I see huge gaps between theory and practice. In other words: In the seminar everything seemed so practical and later it turned out it's not.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is for Project Managers, Developers, Managers, Software Engineers, Team Leads as well as Team Members who want to substantially succeed in their project work.</p>",
