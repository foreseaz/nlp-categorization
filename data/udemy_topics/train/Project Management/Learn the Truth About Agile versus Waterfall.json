Many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project. </p><p>Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions, develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about \"Agile versus Waterfall\". </p><p><strong><br></strong></p>",
