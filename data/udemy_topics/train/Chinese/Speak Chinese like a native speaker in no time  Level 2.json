    "description": "<p>This course follows the natural process of learning a language, just like how we learnt our mother language, which is completely different from the traditional way of language teaching. </p><p>We will play a dialogue spoken by two to three native speakers. Listen \nas much as possible, like a little baby, emerse your brain into the \nconversation, pay attention to the gestures and any other kind of visual content \nmatches the sound you hear and try to guess the meaning. </p><p>play \nthe conversation as often as possible, until you are able to understand the \ncontent and even able to predict what the next word sounds \nlike.</p><p>The video dialogue will be followed by an explanation lecture, with pin yin, and every detail from the video dialogue. You can listen, repeat, and  try to imitate the pronounciation of a word using shadowing technique ( repeat \nright after you hear a word or a sentence) you can record yourself and compare \nyourself with native speaker. </p><p>In the end, there will be vocabulary extension PPT with sound track.</p>",
