Unfortunately, it does not have as much learning material as Mandarin. This can make starting the language difficult, especially if you&#039;re not living in China or Hong Kong. But never fear, this course teaches you everything you need to get started with Cantonese, start speaking it, and having conversations with native speakers!  <br style=\"\">  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"></h4>  <h4 style=\"\">How Is this Course Taught?</h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The course&#039;s primary teaching methods are audio/visual lectures, explaining and giving examples on different topics in the Cantonese language. An assignment is include after the very important lectures, and listening material (with transcripts!) is available at the end of the course.  </p>",
