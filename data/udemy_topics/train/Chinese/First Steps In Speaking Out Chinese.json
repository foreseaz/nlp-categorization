Foreigners usually find it\n<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">difficult</strong> to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">speak</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">using</strong> the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">correct tones</strong>, this can result in <strong>not\nbeing understood</strong> – frustrating and a waste of the effort and time\nthey put into Chinese. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nThis\ncourse aims to overcome this challenge by making tones and pronunciation core to the lessons and teaching tones in easy, bite-sized\nchunks, so when you speak out your first few phrases in Chinese, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you\ncan be understood</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Benefits\nof pronouncing Chinese correctly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mandarin\nChinese is the most widely spoken language on the planet (Yes, more\nthan English!)</li><li>You\ncan become a more valuable worker in a variety of industries,\nespecially since China is expanding aggressively into the global\neconomy</li><li>Enrich\nyour experience of traveling to China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia</li><li>Open\nup a new world of Chinese culture and new friends</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Building\nUp Confidence when starting learning Chinese is Key</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Tones</strong>\nare <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">central </strong>to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Chinese</strong>. Most foreigners don't pay enough attention to\nthe tones when learning Chinese because they don't have it in their\nlanguage. Then when they speak, they wonder why they are not\nunderstood. Then they get disheartened, think Chinese is too hard,\nand then usually give up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nBy\nhaving your first steps in Chinese centred around the tones\nin a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">step by step approach</strong> where you must <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">speak out what you learn</strong>,\nyou will be able to get to grips with it, and greatly increasing your\nchances of being understood when you speak.
