    "description": "<p>This course was made with one simple goal in mind - to provide a journey into Mandarin that would be as simple and as efficient as possible. You see we understand that you are a busy person living in a busy world. We also were students of Chinese and we didn't like the approach that other course take. So we got all of our experience together and decided to make a course from the student's standpoint, rather than a purely academic standpoint. What results is a short course of about an hour and a half that makes the ancient language that is Chinese, this dragon, an easily approachable fluffy lizard. We know that lizards aren't fluffy but we needed a metaphor.</p>",
