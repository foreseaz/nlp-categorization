    "description": "<p><em>Basic 300 Chinese words</em> course is one of the Chinese vocabulary series.</p>\n\n<p><strong>By the end of the course</strong>, you should know the 300 most common words and how to use them in a sentence. It is also the word list of the official Chinese test HSK level 2. After completing this course, we recommend you take an HSK 2 practice test. If you wish you can then take an official test to get a certification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How the course structured?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In these courses:<br>* The word list is broken up into short lessons. Every lesson has a theme to make it easier to remember.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* As you progress through the course, each new lesson incorporates words and characters from the earlier lessons. This structure results in repetition which should help you with memorization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What materials and services are included?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>（24 Instruction videos with 50 quizzes + PDF + Quizlet flash cards + Mp3 audio + 45 min online tutoring (optional)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Besides instruction video with quizzes and script PDF</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* The mp3 audio will be provided for each lesson to help you improve your listening skills.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* The Quizlet flashcards for each lessons are a great learning tool. You can log in and review the flashcards and take quizzes any time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, in XM Mandarin, we believe speaking the language with a native speaker is very important for language learners. So we are happy to offer every enrolled student a free 45 minutes online tutoring. Of course, it's optional.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pinyin learner-friendly</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is also specially designed for the Only Pinyin learners. You don't have to recognize the Chinese characters. In HSK 2 all the characters come with Pinyin alongside.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are Chinese newbie or beginner learner who is looking for a structure, I would recommend this course. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try before you buy, no problem, just take a look at the trial lessons and download the free materials first.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing you guys in the course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your instructor: Xiao Min (Beijing, China)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
