There could be plenty of reasons why you wanna learn Chinese,you might want to travel , work,or  go to school in China, or you just really admire the Chinese culture.  </p><p>This course follows the natural process of learning a language, just like how we learnt our mother language, which is completely different from the traditional way of language learning.</p><p>We will play a dialogue spoken by two to three native speakers. Listen as much as possible, like a little baby, emerse your brain into the conversation, pay attention to the gestures and any other kind of visual content matches the sound you hear and try to guess the meaning.</p><p>play the conversation as often as possible, until you are able to understand the content and even able to predict what the next word sounds like.</p><p>The video dialogue will be followed by an explanation lecture, with pin yin, and every detail from the video dialogue. You can listen, repeat, and try to imitate the pronounciation of a word using shadowing technique ( repeat right after you hear a word or a sentence) you can record yourself and compare yourself with native speaker.</p><p>In the end, there will be vocabulary extension PPT with sound track.</p><p>After finishing this course, you will be able to communicate with native Chiense speakers with confidence, even speak with a genuine Chinese accent.</p>",
