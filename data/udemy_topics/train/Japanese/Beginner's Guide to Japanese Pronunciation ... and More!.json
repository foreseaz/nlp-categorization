You will receive <strong style=\"\">step-by-step instructions</strong> on how to pronounce Japanese sounds and syllables as well as <strong style=\"\">how to order food in Japanese</strong>, all of which can be <strong style=\"\">completed</strong> <strong style=\"\">in JUST AN HOUR</strong>. This course is useful not only for those of you who are interested in the language but also those who love Japanese cuisines and/or music. At the end of the course, you will receive some tips on how to improve your Japanese pronunciation. There is <strong style=\"\">no prior knowledge of Japanese required</strong> to take this course – HAVE SOME FUN WITH A NEW LANGUAGE!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">WHAT&#039;S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS COURSE?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Although it is short, this course aims to provide students with a <strong style=\"\">real language learning experience</strong>. You will probably learn fewer words and expressions than many other courses that rely on memorization and direct translation. However, this course ensures that you will know exactly <strong style=\"\">WHEN</strong> and <strong style=\"\">HOW</strong> to use the expressions you are going to learn. For example, in many courses you only learn “arigatoo” and “arigatoo gozaimasu” as Japanese “thank you,” but these are not the “thank you” we native speakers use when waiters/waitresses bring us food in a restaurant. <strong style=\"\">WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION</strong>, then? We use a different “thank you” when we leave the restaurant, too. <strong style=\"\">WHY IS THAT</strong>? This course answers these questions with very <strong style=\"\">clear, simple explanations</strong> and helps you master the usages of <strong style=\"\">practical Japanese expressions</strong>, which will give you a good start for learning the language.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">WHAT’S INCLUDED IN THE COURSE?</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·12 videos  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·5 audio files  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·3 handouts  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·2 quizzes  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·1 model dialogue for ordering at a restaurant  \t</p>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">WHAT TOPICS ARE COVERED?</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·Syllables of Japanese  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·Pronouncing Japanese Sounds  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·Ordering Food in Japanese  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t              ·Tips to Improve Your Japanese Pronunciation  \t</p>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  \t</p>  </ul>",
