Personally I spent many years expecting other people to make me happy. Other people think things, new possessions, bigger houses, more money will make them happy.</p><p>And whilst it is true people do add to our happiness as do certain possessions, this course is about making yourself happy on a day to day basis.</p><p>When we look outside of ourselves constantly for happiness, that makes life very difficult for you and the people around you.</p><p>It&#039;s up to you to make yourself happy from with first.</p><p>This course is about you making yourself happy rather than relying on others to make you happy.</p><ul style=\"\"><li> The course is suitable for anyone who wants to draw more happiness into their life.</li><li>The course is a combination of video&#039;s and worksheets to print out.</li></ul>",
