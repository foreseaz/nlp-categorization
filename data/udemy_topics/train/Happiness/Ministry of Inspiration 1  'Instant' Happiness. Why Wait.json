Here's some quotes from the course:  </p>  <p>  \t              'Most people haven't got a f****** clue who they are.'  </p>  <p>  \t              'Dying people don't bull****'  </p>  <p>  \t              'There's more people smiling in a hospice, than the checkout in Tesco'  </p>  <p>  \t              'I'm not going to give you a list of 10 things to do. Why not?  </p>  <p>  \t              Because you WON'T DO 'EM!'  </p>  <p>  \t              So, what this course WILL do is give you is results. Every single one of Richard's tools, on its own would be enough to give you a massive change in your life.  </p>  <p>  \t              And all of them put together is just dynamite.  </p>  <p>  \t              Expect to be astounded. :)</p>  <p>  \t              In this course, Tom Cassidy, the leading Personal Development Instructor here on Udemy, asks Richard to go through his tools for instant happiness.  </p>  <p>  \t          You can do the course in an afternoon, and start applying it instantly. You don't need to master anything, or get better at anything.  </p>  <p>  \t          Be warned:  </p>  <p>  \t          This course is like walking through a door. A door with only one handle. You can never go back.  </p>",
