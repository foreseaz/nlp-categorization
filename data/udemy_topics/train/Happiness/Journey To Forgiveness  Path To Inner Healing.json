    "description": "<p>  \t When we hold on to hate, anger, and resentment the pain never goes away. We live hoping that our predators will suffer, will pay for what they did. We hope that one day they will humiliate themselves and get on their knees and ask us to forgive them. We have high expectations and thoughts of a perfect world when in reality we too have cause pain to others. The fact is that <strong style=\"\">we all have a story to tell</strong>, we all have someone who has hurt us and someone who we have hurt at one point or another.  </p>  <p>  \t What is ironic is that most of us have been taught that forgiveness is a good thing, but unfortunately doing the good thing doesn&#039;t come easy. Although forgiveness doesn&#039;t come easy, <strong style=\"\">forgiveness is vital for our mental and physical well-being</strong>. Forgiveness allows us to live in the present and not get stuck in the past. While unforgiveness gives us a false power, forgiveness gives us real FREEDOM.  </p>",
