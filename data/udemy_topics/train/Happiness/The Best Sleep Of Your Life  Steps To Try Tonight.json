    "description": "<p>Nowadays having a good sleep is something challenging for many of us. In fact, statistics show that almost <strong>2 of 3 grown up adults have serious problems</strong> caused by their poor quality of sleep or by insomnia and they didn’t even realize this! They want to have a better sleep but they don’t actually do something to get that!</p><p>Now I am asking you. How would it feel to be <strong>fully energized and motivated </strong>when you wake up in every morning? How would it be to know that you <strong>get the most from your sleeping hours?</strong> How would it be to combat the stress and the depression by having the best sleep of your life and spending the same amount of time or even less in bed?</p>",
