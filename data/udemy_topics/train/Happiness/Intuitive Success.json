    "description": "<p>It's easy to become stuck in life.  People become tied down by stale relationships, an unsatisfying career, their health or just general circumstances.  But it doesn't have to be like that.  We all have intuition - a different way of deciding what to do that's not based on logic or rationality.  Intuition can guide us to where we should be.  But intuition is a life skill that has to be developed.  That's what we do in this short course.  Help you to develop your intuition so that your intuition in turn can help you to become the person you are meant to be.</p>",
