    "description": "<p>         People often confuse the concept of mindfulness with the idea that one should “stop and smell the roses.” However, if you found yourself with your nose stuck deep into a flower in a field where an angry bull was bearing down on you, this would be the exact opposite of being mindful. Put simply, mindfulness is a state of mind where you are fully conscious and engaged in the present moment and with the demands of the present moment.</p><p>         <br>This online course is designed to make this practice available to many people who find it impractical or impossible to attend regularly scheduled courses outside of their home. This online course would take less time than required for most people just to commute to a formal class.  </p>",
