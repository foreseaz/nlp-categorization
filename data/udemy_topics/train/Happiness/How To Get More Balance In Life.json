    "description": "<p>Like 80% of us, do you too yearn for more balance? </p><p>Do you live to work, or work to live? </p><p>Do you want a life by default or a Life by Design?</p><p>It is said that having work life balance will help you feel more in control of your well-being now and in the future. That you'll be healthier, have better relationships and even be more productive at work. It all sounds easy in theory, but harder in practice – right?</p><p>You can dramatically benefit from re-evaluating your work life balance priorities to ensure that you maximise life's opportunities and minimise life's regrets.</p><p>Even if you feel you already have good work life balance, it can always be better. Work life balance is not something you just get, and that is the end of it. It is an ongoing balancing act, as the dynamics of life and work are forever changing.</p><p>So, if like most people, you are feeling like you are being asked to do more with less, and if you too are finding that you’ve less time for you and the important priorities in your life, then this is the course for you.<br></p>",
