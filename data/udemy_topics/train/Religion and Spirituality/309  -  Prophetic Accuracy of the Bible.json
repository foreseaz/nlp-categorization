    "description": "<p>This is the ninth course in the Bible: Myth or Fact series. In this lesson we will be exploring the prophetic claims of the Bible. This is a critical question when it come to the validity of the Bible. If the prophetic claims of the Bible about the past could be shown to be false then there is no reason to trust to the Bible in its claims about the future. On the other hand if it can be shown that the prophecies of the past and present have come true and are coming true then there is good reason to believe that the Bible&#039;s prophetic predictions about the future will also come true. In this lesson we will aim to answer this question and determine whether the Bible is trustworthy or not. We will cover many areas including:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>What did the Bible predict?</li><li>What&#039;s the difference between a true prophet and a false prophet?</li><li>Have there been predictions made in the Bible that have come true?</li></ul>We invite you to examine these questions with us and to examine the evidence for yourself. We hope that it will inspire you to keep exploring and searching for the truth.",
