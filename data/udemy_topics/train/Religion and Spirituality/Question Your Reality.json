It answers, basically, \"What is the meaning of life?\" And this is a deep and severe question, because for a person who has this question, who cannot find the answer in what their traditions tell them, in what their science tells them, in what art and literature tells them, in what psychology tells them... a person who simply cannot be satisfied with anything but the answer to this question—\"What is the meaning of my life?\"—this is a person who is ready to sense beyond the five senses.</p><p><em>Enjoy changing your perception of reality.</em></p><p><br></p>",
