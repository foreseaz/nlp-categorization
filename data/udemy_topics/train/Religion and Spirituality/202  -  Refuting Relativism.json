Is this worldview as valid as any other? We will examine the implications of living life according to this view and what it would mean. Can we know what is right or wrong? Can we know anything for certain? Does logic and reasoning support or refute relativism? We will provide an answer to all these questions and more. We invite you to come examine the evidence for yourself.</p>",
