    "description": "<p style=\"\">This is the fourth course in the &quot;Blessed is the Nation&quot; series. We will be taking a look at the Biblical position on homosexuality. Is the Bible just a bigoted book or are there good reasons the Bible holds the position that it does. We will look at what the Bible says and compare it to the most recent scientific information to see if this is, in fact, the case. We will also examine the claim that the homosexual lifestyle is as normal and healthy as the heterosexual lifestyle. Join us as we examine this issue in depth. We invite you to examine the evidence for yourself.</p>",
