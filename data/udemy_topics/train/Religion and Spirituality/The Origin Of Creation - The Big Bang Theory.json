    "description": "<p><strong>For thousands of years people relied on the scriptures to describe \nhow we came to find ourselves on this planet. </strong> Then, almost two hundred \nyears ago, we altered our ideas about our origins when Charles Darwin \npublished - 'The Origin Of The Species'.  Since then, most of us have \nagreed that we have about a five billion year long story of how we got \nhere and it all has been proven more or less by our DNA.  But, today, we\n discover that our DNA is composed of much smaller atomic and sub-atomic\n particles and that all of these evolved from the first moments of The \nBig Bang.  This course puts together all of these historic theories of \nour Creation and makes sense out of them based on the most modern and \nmost accepted new scientific evidence.</p><p>by Michael Mathiesen - Author of The God Particle Bible - The \nForce Equation - The Doomsday Watch and over fifty titles based on \nScience and the latest Scientific Discoveries. </p>",
