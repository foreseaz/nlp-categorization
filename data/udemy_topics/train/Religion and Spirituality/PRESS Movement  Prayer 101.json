    "description": "<p>After her 2nd miscarriage and the death of her grandmother, Taquoya  felt the pressure of leading her youth group of over 135 youth, ministering and life in general. One night, as she was crying out to God about all the things that were happening, God said, \"Press, prayer reaches every single situation\". In one moment, God birthed a movement that has literally ministered to tens of thousands of people just from it's name alone. </p>\n\n<p>The P.R.E.S.S. is not just a prayer course, it is about life, God and joining a community of prayer warriors in development. It is appropriate for young and old and has proven to be effective for those from elementary through older adults. This will be eight lessons of Bible-based with each lesson being taught by two different teachers so you can have different perspectives while receiving life changing words that if you put to use, <strong>WILL</strong> help you! If you reach for God, He will reach for you and you will get results!</p><p>P.R.E.S.S. Prayer Reaches Every Single Situation, is  a licensed trademark.</p>",
