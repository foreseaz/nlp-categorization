While some have accurately upheld the Genesis account, many more have not. In order to distinguish the truth about Noah&#039;s Ark, and to clear the fog of confusion surrounding it, Branyon May (Ph.D.) plainly addresses the facts and clearly demonstrates â€œThe Reality of Noah&#039;s Ark&quot; with stunning visuals and concrete examples to strengthen your faith.</p><p style=\"\">With the integrated use of visuals and text, this course will walk you through the events leading up to the flood and answer many questions like &quot;How could all of the animals fit?&quot;, &quot;Could Noah have really built the ark?&quot; and &quot;Was there really a global flood?&quot;</p>",
