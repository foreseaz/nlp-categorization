In this class we examine the historical foundations of Hinduism and Buddhism. We will also begin to discuss some of the main spiritual principles of these religions. We will explore whether these two major world religions have historical authenticity, logical consistency, and moral veracity. We hope you will join us as we take a deep look at these religions and that you will gain the knowledge to distinguish between Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity. We invite you to examine the evidence and determine whether and religion is true or not.</p>",
