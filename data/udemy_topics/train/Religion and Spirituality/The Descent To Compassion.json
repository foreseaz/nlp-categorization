    "description": "<p>The disciples walked with Jesus beyond the four walls of the temple and learned what sharing the Kingdom message was truly all about. In the <em style=\"\">Descent to Compassion Course</em>, we will go beyond Sunday morning service, past evangelism projects, and out into the highways and hedges where life happens and does not stop for a 30-minute sermon. We will come along side of where Jesus is walking and working every day, desiring His people to join Him in the work.</p><p>Divine moments happen every day because God is always at work. Each and every day we get up, if we open our eyes, we can see Him â€“ or we can blindly walk away. Through experiencing these moments of divine encounter, our lives receive fresh meaning. Living this kind of compassionate lifestyle keeps one other-focused instead of self-focused. Good works have been prepared in advanced for us, and the Lord is ready to lead us by the hand to discover where those works exist.</p>",
