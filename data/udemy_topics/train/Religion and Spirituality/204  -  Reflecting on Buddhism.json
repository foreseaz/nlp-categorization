    "description": "<p>In this lesson, we continue the discussion on Buddhism. We will shift our focus from the history of Buddhism to the fundamental beliefs of Buddhism. We will explore the veracity of the claims of Buddhism using logic, the scientific method and the evidential method. We will then compare the results to the claims of Christianity and which belief holds up better under scrutiny. By the end of this course you will be able to determine whether the claims of Buddhism can be believed and trusted. You will also be better equipped to determine which religion is most likely factual.</p>",
