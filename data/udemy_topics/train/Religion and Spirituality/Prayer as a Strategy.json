    "description": "<p>Do you sometimes get caught up in the excitement of going overseas on a mission trip and forget that you are truly entering enemy territory?  Or perhaps have you done so many overseas trips that you consider yourself experienced enough to get the results you think are possible without being open minded enough to realize that there are divine results that are NOT possible without God's direct intervention?</p><p>If you want to go overseas just to have basically have the experience of a tourist, it's not necessary to engage in strategic prayer.  If, however, you are being called by God to leave your normal safety net filled with all your self-reliant tools to do something only GOD can do, you must recognize the necessity of strategic prayer.  </p><p>Participants in this course will be challenged to include prayer as a strategy in missions endeavors, not as an afterthought but as a necessity.  They will learn not only why they should be praying but also specifically what they should pray and how they should pray it.  As prayer is then incorporated into our missions strategy, God will do things that only He can do.  And GOD is the one who will get all the glory!</p>",
