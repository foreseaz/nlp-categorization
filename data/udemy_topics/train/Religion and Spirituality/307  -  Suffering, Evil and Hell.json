    "description": "<p>This is the seventh class in the Bible: Myth or Fact series. In this class we will delve into the serious and troubling problems of suffering, evil and hell. The issue of suffering and evil is one of the top reasons why people believe there is no god. They say even if there was a god, he wouldn't send people to hell, therefore if God exists he is clearly not a good God. These are serious challenges that we will explore and attempt to resolve in this lesson. We will be covering:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>The kinds and causes of evil</li><li>The nature of God</li><li>Why a Good God allows evil</li></ul><p>We hope this lesson will help you gain an understanding about the full scope of the problem of evil and how a Good God can allow such evil to exist. We hope you will gain confidence in the fact that there is a Good God and that He will someday defeat all evil.</p>",
