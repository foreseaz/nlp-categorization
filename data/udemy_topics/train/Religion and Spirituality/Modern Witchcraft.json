    "description": "<p><span>Modern witchcraft is based on the historically authentic beliefs and practices of classical witchcraft as adapted for the modern era. </span><span>It is not the same as \"Wicca\" and does not involve the religious worship gods. True witchcraft is a spiritual discipline and way-of-life that emphasizes self-empowerment and mastery of one's own fate.</span>   <span>Witchcraft focuses on the importance and value of the Self. Some people may see this as bad, but it is the philosophy of the most successful people in the world. Witchcraft understands that people who have limited choices, limited wealth and limited resources are not empowered people. Such people are unlikely to enjoy a satisfying life or contribute to society in a positive way. </span>   </p><p><span>A fully empowered person is in control of their own fate, their personal resources, their careers and their future. These are the people who have a positive impact on their own lives, the lives of their families and on society as a whole. Witchcraft is the art of being an empowered person.</span></p>",
