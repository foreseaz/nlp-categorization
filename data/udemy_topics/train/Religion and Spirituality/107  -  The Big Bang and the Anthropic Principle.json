    "description": "<p>  \t  In this course, we continue the series of Created or Evolved Classes. We will examine the plausibility of the Big Bang Theory using several methods. Does it match with known laws of science? Does it defy the rules of logic? Is it statistically possible for the Big Bang to occur and kickstart evolution? We invite you to come examine the evidence for yourself and determine which view is more plausible. Were we truly created to live on a unique planet?  Or are we just here by accident? Come find out. This course has a total of 19 video lectures which are each 2 to 5 minutes long.  </p>",
