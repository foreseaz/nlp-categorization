    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This 19 lecture course continues the examination of the evidence for whether we were created or evolved. In this course we lay out the argument for Intelligent Design and Creation and attempt to answer some very important questions. Do genetics disprove evolution or support it? Can information come from non-information? If you are wondering whether Intelligent Design can be supported by science, we invite you to come examine the evidence for yourself. No matter what your point of view is we invite you to check out this class  </p>",
