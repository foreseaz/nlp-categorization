    "description": "<p>This is the sixth class in the Bible Myth or Fact series. In this lesson we will take a hard look at some of the most mentioned objections to the Bible. Does the Bible actually support slavery? Is it anti-women? Does it show that God is a genocidal maniac? These are modern day questions that cause many to doubt the validity of the Bible. If the Bible really does support these evil and bad things then there is good reason to reject the Bible. However, if it could be demonstrated that everything the Bible says about these issues has a rational explanation and that it was intended to lift people up as God intended, then there is reason to believe the Bible is true and trustworthy. We will cover many issues including:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>What these terms meant then and now</li><li>Is the Bible pro or anti-women</li><li>Was there a beneficial purpose to slavery in the old testament</li><li>What were the levitical laws originally intended to do</li></ul><p>We invite you to explore these hot button topics with us. We hope by the end you will have more confidence the Bible was written by a God who wanted to bless people and not make their lives miserable. </p>",
