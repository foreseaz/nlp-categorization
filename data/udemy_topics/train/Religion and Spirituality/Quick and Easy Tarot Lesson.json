It was a slow process for me and most of the books I read were very hard to understand and sometimes 300 to 700 pages long.  </p>  <p>  \t     I made this course so that you do not have to go through the pains I did trying to learn how to be a successful tarot reader.  </p>  <p>  \t     This course will show you step by step instructions where it makes perfect sense and you can use what you have learn by the end this course for personal use, helping others and/or to make real money online.  </p>  <p>  \t     Disclaimer  </p>  <p>  \t     The information contained in this website is for general information purposes only.
