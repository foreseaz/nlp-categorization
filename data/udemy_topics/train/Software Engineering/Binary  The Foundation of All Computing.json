Awesome!&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course is all about binary, hexadecimal, and the core concepts that make all of our modern information technology possible. There are videos, quizzes, and a couple of App Cat episodes in presentation format.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  You should watch the videos in order. Some of them build on the content from the last video. There are 3 chalkboard session videos that show the how-to steps for reading and writing binary and hexadecimal. You should watch those with paper and a pencil. You&#039;ll want to follow along.  </p>",
