Either working on projects with their employer, client, or for a personal project, this course will help to get up and running as quickly as possible. </p><p>Setting up a development environment is a very basic need in order to do any professional development, so we have spent a lot of time and effort to ensure that the playground for development is supportive and enables rock-solid coding.</p><p>This course is for all levels of developers that want to learn node.js outside of simple tutorials that do not teach how to run projects in the real world. They just want to just dive in and build something that is production grade. All the materials are easy-to-follow videos and will take no longer than three hours to get up and running. </p>",
