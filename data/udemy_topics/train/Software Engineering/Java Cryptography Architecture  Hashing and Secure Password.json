This applies to Web applications and Java-based Desktop\napplications (e.g., Swing, AWT, SWT/RCP, JavaFX), but also database\nand backend applications as well as Android apps.</p><p>Get practical security\nbackground information from an <strong>IT security</strong> expert. Learn how to\nencode hashes in-memory and stream-based. Learn how to use salt and\niteration count for secure password hashing following PBKDF2 from the\nsecurity standard PKCS#5.</p><p>You should be an\nexperienced Java developer to take this course. We will do hands-on\ncoding examples that can be directly used within your enterprise\napplications.</p>",
