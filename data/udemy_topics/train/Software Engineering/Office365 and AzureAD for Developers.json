    "description": "      Developing for Office365 is figuring out Azure AD, and mostly REST queries. The REST queries are the easy part. But a proper understanding of how Azure AD works from a developerâ€™s perspective is the more important part. Whether you are developing for Office 365 or not, as your organization embraces the cloud, a solid understanding of developer concepts in Azure AD is necessary. This course provides hands on explanations of all the AzureAD scenarios you need to know as a developer, followed by tying that knowledge in Office 365 APIs and the Microsoft Graph. Lots of hands on examples and code in this course.",
