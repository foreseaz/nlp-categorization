    "description": "<p><strong>This is a thoroughly detailed course that uses lots of animations to help you visualize the concepts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This course provides a comprehensive explanation of different types of graph and various graph algorithms. Throughout the course a step by step approach is followed to make you understand different algorithms. Through this course you can build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms that can help you to <strong>crack coding interviews</strong> and work in the industry.</p>\n\n<p>The course is broken down into easy to assimilate short lectures and <strong>complete working programs</strong> are shown for each concept that is explained. The algorithms and examples are explained with figures and animations to simplify the learning of this complex topic. </p>\n\n<p>In this course, Java is used for implementing various Data structures and Algorithms, but you can easily implement them in any other language like C++, C#, Python. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
