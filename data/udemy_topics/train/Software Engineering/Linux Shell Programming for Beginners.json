    "description": "<p>Want to feel like an awesome spy hacker similar to the one in the movies that opens a command line terminal and manages to complete complicated tasks using a few simple codes? Well, this can be a reality using BASH.</p>\n\n<p>A huge chunk of a programmer’s time is wasted in trying to repeat codes and processes, especially when it comes to working with UNIX or Linux. The constant commands that are required to program or create systems is a tedious and long process. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Well, here’s how you can eliminate that and save a whole buncha time – BASH </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Bourne Again Shell, more popularly known as BASH is a UNIX/Linux shell and a command line interpreter that runs commands from a standard input file. This shell comes with a nifty feature that allows you to reduce the amount of commands that you have to call personally by automating them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our Shell Scripting course has been specifically designed to teach you how to use BASH to shave hours from your coding practice. Learn how to write shell scripts, learn how command history, echo command and even variables work, along with how to automate simple and complex commands. This BASH tutorial doesn’t even require you to have previously worked with BASH. All it needs is for you to be familiar with UNIX or Linux and have a machine that runs UNIX or Linux – that’s it! That’s all you need to be on your way to learning automation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course starts at the very beginning including what is BASH, what are shells, what do you  mean by shell scripts, customizing your shell, difference between a shell script and an interactive shell, command line-options, statements, loops and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to providing you with theoretic information about BASH and Shell Scripting, the course will also give numerous examples at every step to get you familiar with how scripting works and what happens when you execute a certain script. Additionally, you will also be provided with all the scripts that were used by the instructor to try on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Learn how to write well documented, modular, efficient and complex shell scripts, automate daily routines, basic programming concepts such as loops, commands and statements, how to effectively write command line processing, process management and even manipulate command-line functions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> So, what are you waiting for? Click Enroll and unleash the power of scripts!</p>",
