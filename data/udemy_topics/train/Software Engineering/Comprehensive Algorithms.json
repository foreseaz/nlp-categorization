    "description": "<p>  \tThis course provides a comprehensive overview of the concepts of algorithm analysis and development. I attempted to make the course as straightforward as possible, to the point where no previous experience in algorithm analysis or formal computer science education is required. The videos review popular algorithms such as merge sort, radix sort, Huffman coding, and many more, along with some of the data structures that are utilized in combination with these algorithms, such as queues and stacks. I also review a number of graph algorithms and give introductions to additional advanced algorithm analysis concepts.  </p>  <p>  \tI developed this course while I was taking a graduate level Analysis of Algorithms course from Texas Tech University, and these are all the main topics that we discussed.  </p>",
