It's also an <strong>programming interview favorite</strong>. The study of graphs and algorithms associated with graphs forms an entire field of study called graph theory.</p><ul><li>Directed and undirected graphs</li><li>Adjacency matrices, lists and sets</li><li>Breadth and Depth-First traversal</li><li>Topological sort</li><li>Djikstra's algorithm</li><li>Bellman-Ford algorithm</li><li>Prim's algorithm</li><li>Kruskal's algorithm</li></ul><p>Mail us about <strong>anything</strong> and we will always reply :-)</p>",
