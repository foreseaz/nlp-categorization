    "description": "<p>  \t  If we look around us the software is becoming main-stream in each and every walk of our lives. It is like being part of our blood and we live with it in each every moment of our life. Given this the traditional ways of software development are getting replaced with new ones which will cater to the increasing demands of market. The new ways will cater well to the needs of the users and customers. One of such new model which has become very popular and well suited to this new paradigm is Agile model. Now, given there was a way testing was done in traditional model, the natural question is how is testing placed and done in Agile. This course, &ldquo;Testing in Agile&rdquo; is designed keeping this in mind. Even for those who are not yet exposed to Agile this course will fit well as the course has been designed keeping that in mind. This course applies to all (programmer, tester, business analyst, managers etc. ) in the team.  </p>",
