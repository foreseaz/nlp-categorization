    "description": "<p>Self-confidence plays an important role in our everyday lives. Being confident allows us to set and reach our goals. It provides stability when we are faced with a challenge; it gives us that push that helps us overcome difficulties. Self-confidence is necessary in our personal and professional lives, as without it one would not be successful in either. It gives us the ability to stand up to face our challenges and to pick ourselves up when we fall.<br></p><p>Self Confidence and Assertiveness are two qualities that are essential for success in personal and professional life. If you don't see yourself worthy, and you don't know how to show your self worth when dealing with people around you, life can be very frustrating. These two learnable characteristics will present you with opportunities and benefits in all areas of your life.</p>  <p>The Self Confidence &amp; Assertiveness  Udemy Course will give you an understanding of the true meaning of assertiveness and self-confidence, and how to develop those skills in your day-to-day life. </p>",
