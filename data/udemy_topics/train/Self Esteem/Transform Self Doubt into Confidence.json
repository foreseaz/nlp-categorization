Taking one bold step after another, they don’t seem  to hesitate or second-guess themselves, have no lack of self-confidence, and gain  satisfaction and positive growth wherever they apply themselves. </p><p>Others find themselves mired in a holding pattern of self-doubt,  confusion, and lack of self-confidence. Never getting what they want, or even knowing what  that might be, they feel stuck, frustrated, and unfulfilled. </p><p>      </p><p>This three week course provides the focus, training, and support you  need to define your direction, overcome self-doubt and lack of self-confidence, and map your steps  forward in life. If you’ve been feeling stuck, and ready for a change, use this  course to gain clarity, get traction, and clear your path ahead.</p>",
