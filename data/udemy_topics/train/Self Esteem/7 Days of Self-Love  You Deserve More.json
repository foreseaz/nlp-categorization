If you get want you want and you have an unhealthy self-esteem then you will not be able to enjoy it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tWith self-love you can gain personal wealth, achieve your goals and enjoy successful relationships. Because self-esteem / self-love is the foundation upon which we build our life. Having a healthy self-esteem help us achieve our goals and create our own happiness. Learn to stop feeling or allowing others to make you feel bad about who you are, and what you are.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t In my journey I&#039;ve learned about self-love by making a great number of mistakes and my needy desire to be love by anyone who wanted to love me. Those mistakes have helped me identify some common patterns we tend to make, those I will share with you later. What I also learned is that we often overlook the importance of self-love, because we are preoccupied loving everyone else. In this course you will understand what healthy self-esteem is composed of and how it can improve your life.  </p>",
