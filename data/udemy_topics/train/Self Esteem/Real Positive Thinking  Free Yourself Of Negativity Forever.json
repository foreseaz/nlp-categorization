But for so many of us the results of positive thinking do not live up to the promise.  </p>  <p>  \t Have you ever resolved to think positive or to use positive affirmations but within a few days you seem to give up, perhaps without even really noticing?  </p>  <p>  \t Although there are several reasons why this might happen, one of the main problems is the sabotaging effect of unconscious negative thoughts that oppose our efforts at positive thinking.  </p>  <p>  \t In &quot;Real Positive Thinking&quot; you will learn how to overcome those powerful unconscious negative thoughts so that the promise of positive thinking can be fulfilled for you too.  </p>",
