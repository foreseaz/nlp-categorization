    "description": "<p>  \t   This course uses cognitive therapy techniques and therapeutic stories to help participants understand the origins of their self-esteem wounds and transform their perceptions of themselves. When children experience criticism, they learn to believe themselves to be inadequate or defective. When they experience neglect or abandonment, they learn to see themselves as unimportant or unlovable. When they are abused, they see themselves as broken or bad and feel shame. Without intervention, these perceptions last their entire lives. This course gives participants a new perception of their negative experiences and of themselves, helping them reclaim their positive self-esteem. The course includes video lecture, therapeutic stories, lecture summaries and written exercises. The video is of a six-hour live workshop given by Dr. Ledford, but broken down into thirteen lectures.  </p>",
