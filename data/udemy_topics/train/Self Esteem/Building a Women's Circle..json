    "description": "<p>  \t  When a woman lives her life with a circle of women to return to each cycle, be it weekly or monthly, there is a core sense of wellness, built over time, that is profound. To enter a women's circle is to shed the armour, take off the masks, be truly seen, heard and held, as a practice. This precious life, deeply lived. How do we get there?  </p>  <p>Soaked in a culture that is far more invested in us ripping each other apart than holding each other sacred, how do we find other women safe enough? How do we become safe enough to share circle?  </p>  <p>  \t  This Free course is an introduction to my work, to me. I hope you can find the time and space to take this seriously, as an emotional wellness practice as important as going to the gym, or eating healthy. Building your very own circle, that tends you, that you tend for your inner garden within.  </p>  <p>  \t  Please, join me, and bring your women friends with you for the best experience of this work! By the end of it, you will have a whole lot of tools to build what ever shaped circle you, as a group of self honouring women, wish to build!  </p>",
