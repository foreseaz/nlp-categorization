    "description": "<p>Positive Psychology” takes the traditional “just think positive” approach out of the trite and fluffy inspirational speaker category into the real psychology behind the power of positivity. A simple model is shared to provide a tool for students to immediately implement in their own lives. Traditional psychotherapy is based on a model of pathology, diagnosis, treatment. A positive psychology approach is less stigmatizing and therefore has a broader reach to a segment of the population who may not otherwise benefit from services in a more traditional setting. In addition to the theoretical models presented, practical applications including communication, relationship dynamics, and personal protection are also addressed and explored.</p>",
