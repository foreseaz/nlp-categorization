    "description": "<p>  \t  are you looking to dramatically improve your marketing ?  </p>  <p>  \t  a successful <u>business</u> is rewarding in so many ways, you are your own boss so there is no need to work in a job to help build somebody else&#039;s business, the amount of money you can generate from the internet is humongous, you achieve success,  so you can be in a position to help other peoples life&#039;s.  </p>  <p>  \t  it all sounds so great.  </p>  <p>  \t  indeed living life with <u>a healthy income</u> is truly a dream come true, but it is not as easy as it sounds, yes you may of done tons of research on how to  but still feel like you are not getting the solid results that you are looking for. To be successful on the internet it requires effort, belief, motivation and correct formulas.  </p>  <p>  \t  i wanted to create a unique course to help my customers every step of the way, from absolute beginner to intermediate to building a successful online empire, the course is structured in three sections.  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><strong></strong>section 1 - the first section is to teach you how to generate your first                                             commissions and incomes with simple but powerful strategy&#039;s. It is                             hard to become successful within this industry when you                                   approach this game as a beginner, not knowing where to start, not                             knowing if you are doing things correctly, and feeling fed up when your                       results are not working and seem to be getting failure after failure.</li>  \t<li>section 2- section two is to take you from beginner to intermediate, walking you                           through <u>product </u>creation in detail, discussing the different types of                               products you can create, how to create your own video courses and other kinds of products, where to upload                           the product and how to maximise your profits to the highest possible                           level. </li>  \t<li>section 3- the last section is not necessarily for an expert, rather it is to teach you                      what the experts and gurus are doing to generate millions of dollars                            every year, I will be showing you the true formula to an automated                                business. Realistically there is no such thing as a product or software                        that will generate you a million dollars on auto pilot, and believe me I                            have seen a lot of products out there that say that there product will                          do this for you, the undeniable truth is that such thing does not exist. i will tell you what does exist, products that includes how to build an                              automated income on a large scale and includes correct curriculum                            that teaches how to set up your fundamentals correct in order to be                            successful.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  the &quot;guidance to online wealth&quot; course is target at those of you that are beginners to marketing, those of you that are knowledgeable within marketing, but still struggle to get strong results. And finally for those of you that are already experienced and looking to expand your internet empire. i wanted to give my students a number of different options to choose from so each section has different detailed strategy&#039;s to get you up and running, so the target audience for my course is for anyone looking to gain a healthy income from the internet no matter what level you are currently at.  </p>",
