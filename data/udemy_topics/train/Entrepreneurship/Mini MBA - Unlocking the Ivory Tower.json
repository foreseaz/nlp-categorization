The lecture material is based on our book <em style=\"\">Unlocking the Ivory Tower: How Management Research Can Transform Your Business</em>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The course addresses major fields in business:strategy, leadership, entrepreneurship, organizational theory, international business, innovation, finance, and decision-making.This course can serve as a distilled education for those who have not pursued a management degree, a refresher course for those who did, or a time-effective way to expand beyond the concepts taught in most MBA programs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Students in this class will participate in team exercises to apply the academic research summarized in real-world examples.  </p>",
