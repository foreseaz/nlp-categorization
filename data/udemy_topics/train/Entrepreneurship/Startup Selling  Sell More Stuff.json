I’d previously read Solution Selling to overcome a feeling that I’m an engineer not a salesperson, but found the book too theoretical to help. This workshop was a hit-the-ground-running introduction where I left feeling that I can do sales. Highly recommend it.&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">        - Riaz Rizvi, Principal at Kickstart Platforms</em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       &quot;Scott was instrumental in developing our enterprise sales process by teaching us how to navigate through target prospects and developing sales experiments to optimize our process.&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">        - Patrick White, CEO at Synata, Best New Enterprise Product at LAUNCH 2013</em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Book Reviews for &quot;Startup Selling&quot; and &quot;52 Sales Questions Answered&quot; (by the course author)</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    &quot;I found this book useful as we all sell something to someone no matter what our job is. The customer could be your manager or co-workers, and you might be selling your new idea rather than a product.
