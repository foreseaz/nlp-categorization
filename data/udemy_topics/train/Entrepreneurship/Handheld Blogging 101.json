In short and to-the-point lectures, I&#039;ll guide you through setting up a self-hosted blog using the WordPress blogging platform. I&#039;ll include videos and demos, but when you successfully complete the course and put what you&#039;ve learned into practice, I&#039;ll also include a one-on-one 15-minute appointment session access to me personally so if you have specific questions, I&#039;ll answer them personally.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In four sections of four lectures each, I&#039;ll take you through every step of the process from getting a hosting package, procuring a domain name, installing WordPress, tweaking it, and customizing with some fun features that make your blog uniquely yours.  </p>",
