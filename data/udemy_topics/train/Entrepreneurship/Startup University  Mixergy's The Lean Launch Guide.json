Then I made each interview&nbsp;actionable.</span></p> <p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">I hired a writer to tightly edit the transcripts of each program into a guide that will change forever the way you create new products. It will give you a framework for launching leanly. And it will empower your customers to show you how to improve your product and make it irresistible.</span></p> <p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What&#039;s included</strong></span></span></p> <p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Tightly-edited, highly-focused transcripts</strong><br style=\"\" />Each one is designed to be read like a book and comes from an entrepreneur that I consider an authority on the topic.</span></p> <p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">40 action points, compiled from the interviews</strong><br style=\"\" />No need to hunt through each interview to figure out how to take immediate action.
