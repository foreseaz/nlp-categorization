But for the work that he did, he believes he should still keep his 1/3 share of the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The two of you left are now essentially doing all the work, but for only 2/3 of the company. </strong>Still worth pursuing? Maybe. But you definitely won't be happy.</p>\n\n<p>With 'deadweight' cofounders with significant equity stakes, you'll be lucky if you could attract any new team members or investors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't make this dumb mistake. My course and my calculator will allow you and your cofounders to have a collaborative and transparent conversation how much of the company each person should get. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>_____________________________________________</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Look, starting a new venture is hard enough, but having to figure out what is fair for each cofounder shouldn't be the hardest thing. </strong></p>\n\n<p>By taking this course and using my easy to useÂ <strong>startup equity calculator</strong>, you'll learn some ways on how to avoid this unfortunate, yet preventable situation. And you and your team might even have fun with the pie slicing exercise!</p>\n\n<p>Through the course, you'll learn what you should into your equity pie considerations and how to use a systematic approach for calculating each founders fair share, collaboratively and openly.</p>\n\n<p>While this course isn't intended to provide you with the THE \"correct solution\", it will give you and your team a great starting point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And it'll make easy an often awkward conversation about who should get how much and why.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Deciding and agreeing on how to divide the initial equity pie is no trivial task, but this tool will definitely help get the conversation going on the right path <em>by forcing you and your cofounders to decide on what are the key milestones for your venture and how each of you are going to be making your contributions.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What if your starting a more traditional business?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whether you're going for a high growth type of startup or a more traditional startup with known benchmarks for revenue and cash flow, I've got you covered.</p>\n\n<p>I'll explain to you which of the TWO frameworks and tools you should use depending on the type of venture you're starting up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take a look at the preview lectures to check out the calculators in action and you'll see how they can help you and your cofounders with having a smart and equity conversation about splitting the pie.</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Good luck and happy slicing!</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>_____________________________________________________</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, I personally respond to EVERY question or discussion post.</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><em><br></em></p><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></p>\n\n",
