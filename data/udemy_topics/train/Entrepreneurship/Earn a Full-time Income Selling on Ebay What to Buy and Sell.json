The main problem that sellers have is where to find items to sell and what to sell. <br></p><p>In this course, I will take you from a beginner to a professional ebay seller. I will address the basics of ebay such as creating an account and walk you through the more challenging aspect which is how to find items to sell and what to sell. </p><p>What qualifies me to teach this course? Well, I have been selling on ebay for over six years and sold over 1.7 million dollars worth of items. I have sold everything from women's make up, to electronics and cars. You name it, I have sold it!</p><p>Furthermore, I am a top-rated seller, meaning that I am among the very best sellers on ebay. I am confident that my experience and success selling on ebay qualifies me to teach and train others on how to sell on ebay. There are quite a number of lecturers who teach about selling on ebay but there are very few who have actually done it on the sort of scale that I have.</p><p><br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",
