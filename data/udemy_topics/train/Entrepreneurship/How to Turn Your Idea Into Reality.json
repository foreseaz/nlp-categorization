But you may also turn your idea around in a day or a few days, if it is an ebook. You can also do the course first and then take the steps to manifest your idea. Whatever suits you best.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  So many people have looked back in their lives and regretted they never turned their very special idea around and therefore never experienced success. Don&#039;t be like them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Start your success now!</strong>\r\n</p>",
