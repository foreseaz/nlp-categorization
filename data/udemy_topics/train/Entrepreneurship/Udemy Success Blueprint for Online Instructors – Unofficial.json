    "description": "<p><em>This course is not sponsored by or affiliated with Udemy, Inc.</em><em></em><br></p><p><strong>\"This is a 100% fat-free course on being a successful Udemy instructor. Nothing is left out, and it contains everything you need. </strong><strong>Yes - to be successful on Udemy you have to be a good teacher and have good content. So if you can do that, I'll show you the rest.\"</strong></p><p>Hello!</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to become a great Udemy instructor and make a real living doing so, you are in the right place. This course will teach you everything you need to make a difference to more students and earn more money than you ever did in the classroom.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will cover everything from course creation, launching your course, course marketing, ongoing student engagement, and proven ways to maximize your teaching revenue.</p>\n\n<p>It took me about 3 years to figure out everything presented in this course, <strong>but now I have the fastest growing guitar course on Udemy, with over 6000 students in 6 months with over 50 perfect 5 start ratings!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since I am intimately aware of the struggles of teaching online, from course creation, budgeting, marketing (I had no experience selling ANYTHING), and just being a great teacher,<strong> I wanted to take the time and make a course dedicated to the teachers like me</strong>, who aren't internet marketers by trade, who want to be a great teacher online and make a real living doing so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No joke - I knew NOTHING about online teaching, internet marketing, making videos, pricing, etc. when I started. Simply put, you get it wrong until you get it right, and I'm very proud to be able to share what I've learned with you guys.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If I can do it  - You can do it. Period. It doesn't matter what you are teaching. If you are a good teacher and care about your student's success, I guarantee this course will show you exactly how to reach more students, make more money, and make a bigger impact than you ever thought possible!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unlike most courses on how to make money teaching on Udemy, this one is instructed by a former classroom music teacher, not a marketing professional. This is important for 3 reasons:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1. Marketing professionals generally sell courses on marketing - not on other skills - so unless you are trying to be an internet marketer, these courses aren't exactly applicable.</p>\n\n<p>2. Marketing professionals are not normally teachers by trade, so their courses aren't clearly organized and lessons don't follow a logical order.</p>\n\n<p>3. Marketing professionals want to sell you more marketing courses, because that's how they make their money, so they are by nature open-ended and much is left out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I on the other hand am a teacher, and I make my living teaching real skills - not just how to make money - and I don't offer any other marketing courses. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Quite frankly, I made this course because I have been helping other instructors launch their teaching careers, and I realized that there are so many people that could benefit from what I've learned - it's almost an obligation to share it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The online learning industry is exploding, and the time is now. <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">It's 2015 Baby!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, I want all of my courses to be as interactive as possible</strong>, so if you wish to post videos completing lessons, or have a question about any specific lesson, please post the YouTube link or the question in the discussion forum and I will respond to you ASAP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is something you won't find on any other course anywhere! I try to check the forums daily. </strong></p>\n\n<p>And remember, you have a no questions asked 30 day money back guarantee. I'm confident you'll see the quality of the course right away, but if you don't love it, that's fine too...just send me a message and tell me how I can improve:)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, just to make sure you love it, you can preview the course for 5 minutes without purchasing. So take a look around!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please Enroll Today!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael Palmisano</p>",
