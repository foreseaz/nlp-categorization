It is the minimum return that investors expect for providing capital to the company, thus setting a benchmark that a new project has to meet.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  For an investment to be worthwhile, the expected return on capital must be greater than the cost of capital. The cost of capital is the rate of return that capital could be expected to earn in an alternative investment of equivalent risk. If a project is of similar risk to a company's average business activities it is reasonable to use the company's average cost of capital as a basis for the evaluation. A company's securities typically include both debt and equity, one must therefore calculate both the cost of debt and the cost of equity to determine a company's cost of capital. However, a rate of return larger than the cost of capital is usually required.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This course explains the technicalities involved in computation of Cost of Capital through simple examples, case studies, etc.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Students will learn how to compute  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  a) Cost of Equity;  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  b) Cost of Preference Share Capital;  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  c) Cost of Debt Funds.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Students will also learn how to compute the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Knowledge on Weighted Average Cost of Capital is very important for any one who is planning to pursue career in Finance.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This course is structured in self learning pace.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Take this course to understand the nuances of Cost of Capital for running profitable business.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p><strong>Mandatory Disclosure regarding course contents:</strong></p><p>The contents of this course will also be available in </p><p>a) Financial Management - A Complete Study</p><p>b) Accounting, Finance and Banking - A Comprehensive Study</p>courses, which are comprehensive in nature.
