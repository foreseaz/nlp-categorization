Our 6 week system for launching an idea and transforming it into a functional business has been the KEY to us creating a multi-six figure business in just 3 years. This being a business that was created from scratch, with only a couple of hundred dollars in the bank account. Not to mention we've used this same process to create new business after new business, all with rapid success. <br> <br> Our \"Business Creation Resume\" includes: an import business, a resale business buying surplus at pennies and selling at top dollar, a non-profit teen center, a photography company, a T-shirt company, a regional and national magazine, a publishing company, a holistic center, and a consulting and coaching company, and, of course, online courses. What we found was that every business venture had the same process to jump start—or QUANTUM LEAP—it into success.<br> <br> But it's deeper than that. You see, we LOVE more than anything to teach people how to take an idea and create it into a reality. Why? Because our process is such a FAST and EASY way to get results and it's SO exciting to get to share it with other entrepreneurs who want to do their part to make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, ARE YOU READY TO QUANTUM LEAP?<br> <br> <strong>Below are the 6 Steps to Quantum Leaping Your Business in 6 Weeks </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Although this program is designed to quantum leap your business in 6 weeks, it can be implemented at your own pace.)</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1.
