By <strong>finding small chunks of free time </strong>that I sandwich between real-life \"have-to's\".</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Nancy is a wealth of ideas about how to get more out of the small bits of time that can be easily wasted. I can see now how I will be able to progress towards some very large goals. Thanks!</em>\" Bruce Myron</p>\n\n<p>If you have a real life - and I hope you do - your days are probably filled with</p>\n\n<ul><li>kids</li><li>cooking</li><li>email</li><li>eating</li><li>work</li><li>Facebook</li><li>play</li><li>appointments</li><li>sports </li><li>friends</li><li>driving</li></ul>\n\n<p>What you <strong>DON'T </strong>have is four to six hours of free time every day to just sit down and quietly write . . . even though you want to write a book, make more money with your writing or start a freelance business.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like you, The 15-Minute Writer is exactly the right course for you. In this course you'll discover just <strong>how much you can get written in 15 minutes</strong>. And you'll be shocked at how those 15 minutes can add up over a week, month or a year. (Hint:Yes, you can write a novel using this technique). The reality is: <strong>the more you write the more your income can increase.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't spin your wheels if you don't have hours of free writing time because you really can accomplish more than you imagine in just 15 minutes of writing daily.</p>",
