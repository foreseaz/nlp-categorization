You can also charge more in an up sell section. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Many people view fiverr as a poor source of income since each sale is only $5, but I have a system that allows people to make a high dollar per hour ratio, which is normally the main problem on fiverr. Each order, using what I teach, will only take 30 - 45 seconds to fulfill. Most of the time you can fill around 5 orders in less than 5 minutes, and no matter who you are, that should be worth your time. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>There are multiple different ways to use fiverr that are taught in this course so I feel it is good for everyone no matter what you are interested in selling. It is also made so that even first time fiverr users can succeed and make some money. </p><p><br></p><p>I look forward to teaching you!</p><p>-Andrew Burich</p>",
