Those 4 apps covered 1) business ideas 2) business planning 3) marketing and 4) raising money.</p><p style=\"\">The apps aren&#039;t well designed because I designed them myself, but if you are just starting your business, the apps can serve as a good guide to you as you go from business ideas to planning your company to raising money and eventually promoting your product.</p>",
