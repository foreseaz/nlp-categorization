    "description": "<p style=\"\">Agile Pitching is a term brought to you by the INVESTyR DealTeam that identifies a style of pitching that is 180 degrees different from traditional styles entrepreneurs have been taught. We&#039;re hoping this course will shed light on the change in dialogue amongst entrepreneurs and so-called &quot;pitch doctors&quot;. The conversation has changed between investors and entrepreneurs these days and now it&#039;s all about having a dialogue. Forget the notion of the &#039;elevator pitch&#039; that is a jumble of quick talking jargon with an out-of-breath speaking &#039;Ask&#039; . We&#039;ve taught our entrepreneurs to be beggars, they shouldn&#039;t be going around shaking a tin cup for investors money! In this course, the INVESTyR DealTeam breaks it down with screencasts, interviews and presentation slides to show you the best way to open a dialogue with an investor and pitch your business. <br style=\"\"></p>  ",
