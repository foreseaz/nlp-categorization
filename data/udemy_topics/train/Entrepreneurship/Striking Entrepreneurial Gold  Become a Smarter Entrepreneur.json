The distinction makes a difference.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>JUST THINK SMARTER!</strong> Don&#039;t settle for just acquiring new knowledge, learn how to apply it to ever-changing business environment.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Blaze a Path Through the Entrepreneurial Forest:</strong><br>  \t    A small business can be incredibly demanding of your time, your attention, your energy and your money.  The consuming nature of a business pulls the owner in so very close that he or she cannot see the forest because of the trees. Our objective is to teach you, not only, how to see the entrepreneurial forest, but more importantly how to successfully blaze a path through it.<br>  \t<br>  \t<strong>Teaching Entrepreneurs How to Build a Business - Not a Job:  </strong><br>  \t    We teach entrepreneurs how to grow businesses. However, a very common failing of many entrepreneurs is that they build a job for themselves in a business that they happen to own.  Business ownership offers so much more.  Simply building a job for yourself is a waste of your very limited and valuable time, energy and money.  However, building a business will pay dividends for years to come.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Laser Focus for Your Entrepreneurial Energy:  </strong><br>  \t    We teach our students the value of a laser focus for their entrepreneurial energy and effort. We want you to focus on the creation and development of the kind of business that does not require your presence. And when your presence is not required in your business, as the owner you can &quot;cherry pick&quot; what you do.  You can choose to be as involved or as uninvolved as you desire - that is a benefit of ownership.<br>  \t<br>  \t<strong>Eliminate The Stinkin’ Thinking of Entrepreneurship:</strong><br>  \t    Most small business owners follow a very intuitive growth process that depend on them doing what “seems right”. The problem is that our intuition tends to lead us astray. As a result, there are some things that we cannot have lingering in the minds of our students. We call it the “Stinkin’ Thinkin’” of entrepreneurship. These are wrong ideas about business ownership the &quot;seem right&quot; to the entrepreneur at the time.  </p>",
