    "description": "<p>The biggest difference between freelance jobs and full-time jobs is that freelancers are constantly applying to new gigs (since they tend to be shorter term). This means freelancers need to have an outstanding sales strategy and capability in order to be consistently successful. </p>\n\n<p>Sales may scare a lot of people but if you understand what hirers are looking for and put a lot of effort into your sales execution, you're likely to be very successful (especially considering many freelancers are doing sales so poorly today).</p>\n\n<p>We want to discuss all the top strategies, most innovative ideas, and give you tons of examples in how to achieve excellence in freelance gig sales. We'll cover all the major gig types, negotiation tactics, being supremely qualified, writing top business proposals, and more. </p>\n\n<p>This is the course that covers freelance sales and applications more comprehensively than any other you'll find. We're really excited to work with you so join us today!</p>",
