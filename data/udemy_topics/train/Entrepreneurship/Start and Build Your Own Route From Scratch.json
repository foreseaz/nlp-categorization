    "description": "<p>Have you ever been interested in starting your own business? A lot of people get deterred from starting their own business because they simply do not know what business to start. My answer to this question is to start and build a route for the following reasons.<br></p>\n\n<p>1) It's simple! As a route owner you are simply buying products wholesale and selling them to retailers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Low overhead. Retailers have many expenses including rent, electric bills, wages, theft, and many others. Manufacturers have similar costs plus equipment costs. As a distributor we have almost no expenses other than gas to make our deliveries, which we will learn how to minimize. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3) Low startup costs. Once an initial investment is made you will simply be reinvesting your revenues to grow your business. We will learn techniques to minimize, if not eliminate these startup costs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>4) Customers are easy to find and keep! They want you and your products. Why wouldn't they? The more they sell the more money they make. We will learn who our customers are and how to find them. The best part is that once they become a customer they are always a customer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don't need any experience in the industry to start this business. The course will walk you through the process of starting your own route and building your business from scratch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one of a kind course as it is the only course that teaches regular people how to start one of the easiest, most profitable businesses out there. Individual entrepreneurs have been doing this business for years and loving the profits. Now there is a way to learn from the ground up how to start and build this business from someone that has not only done it, but is currently doing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students will learn how to find customers, research categories, pick categories, research suppliers, evaluate suppliers, contact suppliers, vehicle choices, POS systems, finding racks, placing racks, mapping stores, and every other aspect of the business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a business that truly gives you the ability to take control of your life; to build a business that gives you whatever income you desire. It's a business that you can grow and grow and grow until you're satisfied with your income. Once you stop growing you won't have to worry about your income shrinking because this is a business that naturally grows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is this possible? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) Your suppliers will continue to release new, exciting products that you simply plug into your route and increase sales, resulting in higher profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Your current customers will continue to build their businesses by getting new locations. Once they do this, they will simply ask you to set up in their new locations giving you more sales with no work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This truly is a unique business where you never have to worry about your income shrinking and if you are ambitious, you can create a really big business and hire drivers to run the routes for you! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one of a kind course; the only course that walks you through the ENTIRE process of starting and building a route from scratch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Become an entrepreneur today by getting the education you need to start your own route.</p>",
