    "description": "<p>How many times have you scanned an item in a store and got the message \"This item is currently not in the Amazon catalog.\" I used to put these items right back on the shelf until I realized that this was a gold mine.</p><p>Most people will not take the extra time that is needed to create a listing for a new product on Amazon. Those who do are given the chance to capture a whole new market of buyers through Amazon.</p><p>This course is designed to give you the basics on how to create a listing from start to finish. It includes an example of creating a listing from a product that already exists on another store's website and it also covers topics including keyword research, consumer behavior, editing photos, and Amazon search methodology. </p><p>This course is perfect for those who have never created a listing before, those who are bringing a new product to market (wholesale or private label), or those looking to expand their current inventory offerings.</p><p>If you are not satisfied with the course, please email us at gumroad@fbamaster.com and we will work with you to make things right :)</p><p>- Chris, John, and Mike (The FBA Master Crew) </p>",
