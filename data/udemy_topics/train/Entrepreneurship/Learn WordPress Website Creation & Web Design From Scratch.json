A colleague who knew I’d been struggling to create web pages with static HTML suggested that I use WordPress on my new website. So I did. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">That one piece of advice from a guy in 2005 set me on a path. I've been using WordPress and blogging on my site ever since. I have also designed and created countless other WordPress websites for clients through my web design business. I started my own business in 2006, left work two years later and now I run a six-figure location-independent business from various places around the world. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">With WordPress, you can not only to build websites but you can build businesses!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Literally tens of thousands – or probably hundreds of thousands – of viable businesses exist because of WordPress.
