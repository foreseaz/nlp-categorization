For tax purposes, the LLC itself is not a separate taxable entity. Like owners of partnerships or sole proprietorships, LLC owners report business profits or losses on their personal income tax returns.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For these reasons, LLC combines the <strong>best features of a sole proprietorship and partnership and the best personal liability features of a Corporation</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong>Limited Liability Company is perfect for small online and offline businesses.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p><p><em>Thank you for making this the best selling LLC course on Udemy!
