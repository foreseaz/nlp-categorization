(Confession: I've done this...twice). It's so easy to just keeping <em>building</em> instead of <strong>launching and selling</strong>.<br></p><p>However, when you're non-technical, you don't have that option! Instead, you have to figure out how to serve your customers right away.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>This course will give you the tools to start serving customers now.</strong></p><p>After completing this course:</p><ol><li>You will have a <strong>working product</strong> you can use to start getting customers right away.</li><li><strong>Recruiting investors</strong>, partners, and technical talent will be MUCH easier - because you'll have a real product and real revenue.</li><li>You'll obtain <strong>lifetime skills</strong> to quickly prototype and test all your future ideas as well.</li></ol><p><strong>I have taught this course to over 1,500 students worldwide</strong> both live and online, with a  <strong>96% approval </strong>rating (✮✮✮✮✮<span></span>).

I could have watched another hour!\" - Denise Hamilton</li><li>\"<strong>Just feels empowering</strong> that you can get started on your own.\" - Fran H.</li><li>\"I am so happy that I found someone who does not hide under code and the fancy prancy technocrats trying to complicate the lives of practical people seeking the truth about the market.\" - Joanna Recine</li><li>\"Being a non-technical entrepreneur, and launching my first tech startup right now, by far the <strong>best course I´ve founded in the web</strong>. Thanks!\" - Roberto Bolanos</li></ul><p>\"There is so much that non-technical entrepreneurs can do - if they only knew about the resources out there and how to use them. It's not even that hard - just a few tools and permission to think differently. I can't think of a better guide than Tal.\"</p><p><strong>Gabe Weinberg, Founder &amp; CEO of DuckDuckGo</strong></p><p>\"It's about time somebody compiled this information.
