I would personally prefer to call it the <strong>burning desire to achieve a specific and well defined goal.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong> It is the <strong>eagerness and passion</strong> that governs and manages your behavior and <strong>defines the path</strong> along which you will move. Motivation is something that <strong>triggers you into action</strong> and allows you to follow through when obstacles appear.</p>\n\n<p> It is the <strong>endurance to keep moving ahead</strong> in spite of difficult times and difficult circumstances. It is the drive to <strong>stick to your plan</strong> even when all odds are against you. </p>\n\n<p>Motivation is the <strong>vigor and perseverance</strong> that pushes you to <strong>FULFILL YOUR DREAMS</strong>. Our brain is in a permanent state of need for pleasure. If you are able to filter the thoughts that you send to your brain, you are on your way to<strong> controlling how the brain reacts in different situations. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong>Once <strong>the brain detects possibilities to acquire pleasure</strong>, it will jump into action to satisfy its needs. At the same time, however, the brain has the natural tendency to avoid painful and unpleasant situations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn to feed your mind continuously with empowering thoughts</strong>. Fuel your mind with thoughts that are related to <strong>happiness, contentment and pleasure</strong> and the brain will strive towards its achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Use your Power of Motivation to:</p>\n\n<ul><strong></strong><li><strong>Become fearless</strong></li><li><strong>Emanate Confidence</strong></li><li><strong>Climb the career ladder</strong></li><li><strong>Define your goals</strong></li><li><strong>Become more energetic</strong></li><li><strong>Fuel your brain with positivity</strong></li><li><strong>Become hungry for success</strong></li><li><strong>Increase your self-confidence</strong></li><li><strong>Boost your self-esteem</strong></li><li><strong>Conquer obstacles</strong></li><li><strong>Overcome procrastination</strong></li><li><strong>Take control of your thoughts</strong> </li></ul>",
