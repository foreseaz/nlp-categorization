How to target particular keywords within an industry, and make sure that you are using the correct keywords not only for high traffic volumes but also the more expensive keywords for advertisers.</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Blogging for Business</strong> is for people who feel stifled in their 9 to 5 jobs and want to start exploring other opportunities. The course is designed so that you don't have to spend hundreds of hours in the beginning, because I teach you the right way to do things so you don't make the mistakes that many people make when launching their blog.</p><p>I have made a point not to show my popular blogs so I am not using this as a platform to promote myself. You will see from the very beginning in a step by step process on how to publish your first piece of content. Then rinse and repeat to keep building up content.<br></p><p>Once your <strong>Business Blog </strong>domain has reached the 6 month waiting period for Google Adsense, you can activate it and watch the returns start coming in!</p>",
