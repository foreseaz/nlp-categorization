    "description": "<p>Welcome to 2 Weeks to Starting an Event Planning Business. In this course I will take you day by day through setting up your event planning business. I will work with you to provide my personal tips and advice, and also tools and templates that you will find useful during and even after you have your business up and running.</p>\n\n<p>This course is perfect for anyone that is thinking about starting an event planning business or becoming an event planner but is not sure where to start. For that reason, this course is intentionally structured to be reviewed on a one video per day \"drip\" method. This will allow you to focus on completing daily action items before moving on to the next video.</p>\n\n<p>Included is a list of resources at the end of each lecture, with templates and links. You will also be provided with a corresponding checklist that outlines your action item for each day. Students will also be provided with access to a private Facebook group to brainstorm any issues with other students and live sessions with the instructor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say I truly enjoy doing what I do and if you allow me to share some of my tips and advice, you will also be on you way to business success. </p>",
