    "description": "<p>A few years ago I was just like you. Searching for the terms “how to work online,\" “how to work from home,\" “online jobs,\" etc. But most of the so-called “work from home\" sites were fakes. Some of them lead in to fake surveys or ad clicking, and none of them were legitimate. Then I started checking for blogs and forums with relevant topics. Luckily, I found a few good sources after months of endless research. This course contains all the resources I've found over three years of my work from home experience. This course is about  my life, how I started my life as a work from home guy and how I developed a sustainable business from the savings.</p><p>My objective is to provide you with all the reliable companies and other sources that you can earn a sustainable living from while working from home. <strong>This course will help you to avoid  the work from home scams and apply to genuine companies that took me years to find</strong>. Start today and find your first online job.</p><p><strong>I will provide you with email support till you get your first online job and access to my progress webinars for my students.</strong></p><p><br></p>",
