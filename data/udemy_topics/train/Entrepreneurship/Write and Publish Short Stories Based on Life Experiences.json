    "description": "<p>People have always been curious about how other people live – that’s why publishers are always searching for true-life short stories, and why so many of them pay so well. But don’t be fooled though, there’s a definite skill to telling the right stories in the right way, and, to getting accepted.</p>  <p>I know this because I’ve been writing stories like these for the last twenty years. I’ve had them published internationally, everywhere from in best-selling books like Chicken Soup for the Soul, and magazines worldwide, to being given a regular column in a national newspaper, to compiling other people’s stories in a couple of books for Carers, and just about everything in between.</p>  <p>If you’d like to learn all the tricks and skills I’ve learned about making money from this market, please enroll in this course, I’d be happy to teach you.</p>  <p>After all, we all have stories to share; the skill is simply sharing them in a way people want to hear them.</p>  <p>(Also, don’t forget, this course also comes with a FULL, 30-day money-back guarantee, so maybe the true question is: What have you really got to lose by enrolling?)</p>",
