It is focused on understanding the culture and the business etiquette of the most innovative region in the planet throughout real advice and examples given by a successful entrepreneur who moved to the Bay Area in 2011.</p><p>Silicon Valley for beginners is a great way to save you time and money when you decide to come. The course is divided in 18 simple lectures, each one covering one specific topic such as coming to the valley as a founder or to work in a startup or large company. It also explains basic concepts that would make your life here much easier such as accountability, meritocracy, diversity and the execution mindset. </p><p>Additional links and material (such as free e-books written by the instructor) are provided in some of the lessons. The idea is that this course would serve as a reference point for beginners willing to learn more about Silicon Valley.</p>",
