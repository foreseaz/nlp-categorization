Creating a product takes a lot of work; the last thing you want is to put in all that work only to find out that no one is interested in buying a product in your niche. Evaluating demand and competition is a necessity when finalizing a product idea to put into production.</span></p><p><span class=\"bodytext\"><strong style=\"\"> I show you how to find profitable niches that people want and are willing to spend money in. </strong></span></p><p><span class=\"bodytext\">Next I show you how to create products, which might seem like a simple step to some, but to others it is a huge barrier to entry. I explain how to take your idea and turn it into a physical product people can use. Does your idea convert better into an ebook formated product or perhaps you want to go the extra distance and create a powerful video tutorial, either way I show you how to create dazzling products that will capture your customer and keep them wanting more.</span></p>",
