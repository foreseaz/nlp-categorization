Not only did the method increase my visibility online, it gave me material for both a Udemy course (which now has over 10,000 students) and a number of local workshops.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to achieve the same results, and I will also cover the mistakes I made and the things I realize I should have done to gain even more traction.</p>",
