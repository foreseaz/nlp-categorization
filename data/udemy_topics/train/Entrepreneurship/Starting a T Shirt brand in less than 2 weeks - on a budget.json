    "description": "<p>This course is for anyone that wants to start a brand, or just get a really affordable batch of t-shrits printed. This course does not take two weeks! It only takes a few hours, but you will most likely have to wait a week or two for your shirts to be printed! In the meantime, you will learn how to design a shirt, source wholesale blanks, and get the best pricing on screen printing these shirts. You will also learn the best way to set up an online store, which only takes about 30 minutes! You will walk away from this course with a super high quality and fair priced batch of shirts on the way, some basic knowledge on how to work in Illustrator and Photoshop, and an online store that is all set up and ready to bring in sales! </p>",
