Let me tell you that I have been three years with this business and I'm doing very well, and it can only get better, of course I work hard and I try to take care of my clients, but it is a very easy job, and I make very good money. In this course I teach you how to start your own Magazine in your city, Advertising Local Businesses and Making money with it. With this course You will be able to Manage, Design and Distribute your Magazine, although, you can hire some people insofar as your magazine progress. So let's take a very good attitude and decide for something different and very Profitable.</p>",
