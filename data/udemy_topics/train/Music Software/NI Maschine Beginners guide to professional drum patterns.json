    "description": "<p>Learn to easily create 3 styles of professional hip hop drum patterns for your instrumentals, all within using your <strong><em>Native Instruments Maschine</em></strong> software alone.</p>\n\n<p>I've know known many people who struggled to create a decent sounding track, not because their notes were off or out of tuned, but for the fact that the drums patterns could not hold up to the standards of the rest of their work. This course was made to show how to easily create drum patterns without much effort but still getting a professional sound that will enhance the production as a whole<br></p><p>We are going to use plugins such as reverb, delay, and drive which are all stock plugins within Maschine, no need to buy 3rd party products to get a great sound!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm going to teach you how to use what you already have to get a dope industry sound.</p><p>I will not be using the native instruments maschine hardware controller for this course. This was done to help students with a malfunctioning, stolen or broken maschine controller, so they can be able to learn the inside software and still create music easily as if they had the controller all along with their production process.</p>",
