    "description": "<p>\n\t    As a film composer, I had to learn Logic the hard way- thousands of hours of tutorials, years of trial/error, and more questions than I ever wanted to ask.  So here, I've put together a super condensed version of what I have learned so far.  It's 5 hours of some of the most packed material for a beginner of Logic pro. The first hour is probably the most important where I go over the most basic functions.  After that I explain what the effects and such do and how they affect the sound.  </p><p>This will really save you a ton of time if you go through it.  It goes over the most used hotkeys and functions to help you create music, along with an overview of the instruments and effects including a few third party plugins like East/West orchestra.  They're all videos, so just sit back, open up your Logic session and take good notes!<br>\n\t <br><br></p>",
