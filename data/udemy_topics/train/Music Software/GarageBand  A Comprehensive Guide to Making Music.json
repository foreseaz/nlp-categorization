    "description": "<p>  \t   The goal of this course is to give you an moderately in-depth look at the facilities GarageBand offers you to make music.  Since this is a fairly straight-forward piece of software compared to its big brother, Logic Pro, I will help you squeeze maximum productivity out of GarageBand in a relatively short amount of time.  </p>  <p>  \t   The first thing you will learn are the basic sectors of GarageBand and their functions.  Following this, I will dive into the individual sectors of the software, one at a time, and then eventually help you to integrate them together to create a final product.  The course, therefore, will first focus on the individual parts of the software, followed by how to combine the parts to allow you to get to the fun part: making music!  </p>",
