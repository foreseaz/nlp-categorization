    "description": "<p>For years I&#039;ve been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe Ableton Live can be learned by anyone, and cost shouldn&#039;t be a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I&#039;ve used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p><strong style=\"\">This class is an excerpt of Ultimate Ableton Live: Part 4 - Synths &amp; Samplers.The full course is available here on Udemy.

Anthony Allen:</em></p><li><em style=\"\">&quot;I&#039;ve had Live Lite for a while but never quite understood how to use it because of the different options in how to arrange audio. This course explains exactly how to do that and get the most out of Live.&quot;</em></li><li>&quot;Great overview - I would start here for sure if you are just getting your feet wet with live. clear and to the point. session walkthroughs are great. looking forward to more&quot;</li><li>&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;</li>",
