    "description": "<p>For years I&#039;ve been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe Ableton Live can be learned by anyone, and cost shouldn&#039;t be a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I&#039;ve used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>This is Part 4: Synths &amp; Samplers</p><p>This is a really deep class - tons of content, tricks, and tips. I&#039;ll go through <strong style=\"\">all</strong> of the Ableton Live Instruments in this class, with considerable detail on each one. We will also talk about synthesis tricks and tips, getting most out of your samplers, and tons of production tips. Topics include:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>Synthesis Basics</li><li>Types of Synthesis</li><li>Physical Modeling Synthesis</li><li>Elements of Synthesis</li><li>Live&#039;s Analog Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Collision Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Electric Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Impulse Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Tension Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Operator Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Simpler Instrument</li><li>Live&#039;s Sampler Instrument</li><li>Multisamples and Zones</li><li>Sampler Orchestras</li><li><strong style=\"\">Racks!!!!</strong></li><li>Instrument Racks</li><li>Chain Selector</li><li>Macros in Racks</li><li>Drum Racks</li><li>Choke Settings</li><li>The External Instrument</li><li>...and much more!</li></ul><p>I will be making 6 (six!) complete classes in order to bring you the most comprehensive manual on Ableton Live production techniques ever created. Each class has Sets, sessions, and experiments for you to try on your own and follow along with.</p><p>And of course, once you sign up any part, you automatically get huge discounts to all the upcoming parts (the next 5!) of this class.</p><p>You will not have another opportunity to learn Ableton Live in a more comprehensive way that this. <strong style=\"\">S</strong><strong style=\"\">tart here.</strong></p><p><em style=\"\">J.

Anthony Allen:</em></p><em style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><li><em style=\"\">&quot;I&#039;ve had Live Lite for a while but never quite understood how to use it because of the different options in how to arrange audio. This course explains exactly how to do that and get the most out of Live.&quot;</em></li><em style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><li>&quot;Great overview - I would start here for sure if you are just getting your feet wet with live. clear and to the point. session walkthroughs are great. looking forward to more&quot;</li><li>&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;</li></em></em></em></em><ul style=\"\"><em style=\"\"></em></ul>",
