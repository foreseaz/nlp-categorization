    "description": "<p>For years I've been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe Ableton Live can be learned by anyone, and cost shouldn't be a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p><strong>This class is an excerpt of Ultimate Ableton Live: Part 4 - Synths &amp; Samplers. The full course is available here on Udemy. But if you just want to test the waters of this class, then start here!</strong></p><p>In the full class, Ultimate Ableton Live: Part 4 - Synths &amp; Samplers, we cover <em>tons</em> of content, including all (all!) of the Ableton Live Instruments. Here is a summary of topics from that course:</p><ul><li>Synthesis Basics</li><li>Types of Synthesis</li><li>Physical Modeling Synthesis</li><li>Elements of Synthesis</li><li>Live's Analog Instrument</li><li>Live's Collision Instrument</li><li>Live's Electric Instrument</li><li>Live's Impulse Instrument</li><li>Live's Tension Instrument</li><li>Live's Operator Instrument</li><li>Live's Simpler Instrument</li><li>Live's Sampler Instrument</li><li>Multisamples and Zones</li><li>Sampler Orchestras</li><li>Racks!!!!</li><li>Instrument Racks</li><li>Chain Selector</li><li>Macros in Racks</li><li>Drum Racks</li><li>Choke Settings</li><li>The External Instrument</li><li>...and much more!</li></ul><p>You will not have another opportunity to learn Ableton Live in a more comprehensive way that this.</p><p><em>J. Anthony Allen is an Ableton Certified Trainer, and a PhD in Music Composition and master of Electronic Sounds. His music has been heard internationally in film, radio, video games, and industrial sound, as well as the concert hall and theater.</em></p><p><em>He currently as an adjunct professor of composition at the University of St. Thomas, Macphail Academy of Music, and the CEO of Slam Academy in Minneapolis.</em></p><p><em>Praise for other classes by J. Anthony Allen:</em></p><li><em>\"I've had Live Lite for a while but never quite understood how to use it because of the different options in how to arrange audio. This course explains exactly how to do that and get the most out of Live.\"</em></li><li>\"Great overview - I would start here for sure if you are just getting your feet wet with live. clear and to the point. session walkthroughs are great. looking forward to more\"</li><li>\"I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.\"</li>",
