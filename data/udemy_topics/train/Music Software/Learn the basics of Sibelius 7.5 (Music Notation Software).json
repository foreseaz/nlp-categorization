This course will teach you the basics of inputing music into the computer notation program, &quot;Sibelius.&quot; I will be demonstrating using version 7.5, however, while what is displayed on the screen will look different for versions previous to 7, the basic functions and shortcuts are all the same. We will not work toward a specific project, but rather, each topic will be covered as a separate idea, because once the document is created and you start composing, there is no right or wrong order to composing (i.e. after you have notes, you could add dynamics then articulation; or you could add articulation then dynamics.) So essentially, you don&#039;t need to complete the course in order. You can jump around and watch the lessons that pertain more to what you need to learn.  </p>",
