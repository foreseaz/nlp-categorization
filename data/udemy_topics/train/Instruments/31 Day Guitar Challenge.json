    "description": "<p>Welcome to the 31 Day Guitar Challenge! I created this course because I want to give away everything that I learned to other new guitarists. I will show you the path to take to overcome any challenge or obstacle that may come your way. When I first picked up my guitar, I wished I had someone that could point me in the right direction when I felt stuck and wasn't improving like I wanted to. I will show you basic chords, techniques, songs, and scales to grasp the basic concept, but I want you to use my successes and failures to help you grow exceptionally fast while learning to play the guitar. </p><p>Please follow all the directions in the introduction video and you will do GREAT. If you ever need anything, feel free to reach out to me. I love seeing new people learn how to play the guitar and made this course for that very reason.</p><p>When taking this course, watch (1) video per day and play the guitar (2) times per day. I know this may seem like a lot, but your success and progress will grow exponentially if you do so. If you try to play multiple videos in one day, you will easily get burned out within a couple weeks. So plan to set aside time to play twice a day. Remember, this course is only one month long. It will take dedication, but you can do it and it WILL be worth it in the end.</p><p>Good luck and happy playing!</p><p>-Nate</p>",
