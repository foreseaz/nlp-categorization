Following that, he lived in Macedonia for two years,working in the non-profit sector yet immersed in a world of Balkan music, performing with local folk, jazz, and rock musicians in the studio, in local clubs, and at festivals.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t      His collaborators have included Curt Smith (Tears for Fears), Dave Stewart (Eurhythmics), Engelbert Humperdinck, James Torm, composer Mateo Messina (Juno, Thank You for Smoking), producer Charlton Pettus, and French gypsy jazz artist Jessica Fichot.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t      His performance work has taken him to the stages of the Chicago World Music Festival, the Lotus Festival, the Guadalajara International Book Fair, the London Palladium, the Sydney Opera House, and the Araneta Coliseum, where Ali and Frazier met at the Thrilla in Manila. In 2010 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, he debuted Light Connected, a piece for clarinet, alto flute, cello, bass, cajon, dancer, and spoken word poet that he conceptualized and co-composed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t      In addition to his work as a composer-musician, Dave just completed a Ph.D. in Ethnomusicology at UCLA's Herb Alpert School of Music. His work there focused on the Macedonian folk tradition, and on how traditional and popular music reflect, articulate,and construct national identity, politics, class, and ethnic tensions in the context of a post-socialist capitalist society.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t      —  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>This course has been provided by MusicProfessor.com, an online music education company.</em>  </p>",
