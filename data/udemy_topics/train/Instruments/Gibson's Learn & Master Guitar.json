    "description": "<p>  \tGibson&#039;s Learn &amp; Master Guitar is the world&#039;s best DVD-based guitar course that starts an aspiring guitarist at the beginning and builds to a master level of skill. With the Learn &amp; Master system, you get a true multi-modal learning experience (reading, listening, watching, and doing). This is no &quot;learn overnight&quot; approach, but takes world-class guitar lessons to a more comprehensive level using multimedia training presented by expert instructor, Steve Krenz. This course is designed for those who want serious guitar lessons, learning the principles of reading, guitar tab, music theory, and technique. With Gibson&#039;s Learn &amp; Master Guitar you enjoy learning in the comfort of your own home, and on your own schedule. We believe that learning should be fun rather than intimidating. You’ll love Steve’s “take you by the hand” approach in Gibson&#039;s Learn &amp; Master Guitar.  </p>",
