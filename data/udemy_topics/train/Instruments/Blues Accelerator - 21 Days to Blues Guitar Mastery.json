    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  The aim of Blues Accelerator is to take someone with little formal knowledge about blues guitar playing, and turn them into a confident blues player. The ultimate goal that we&#039;re headed towards is the ability to play over the 12 bar blues, which is the bread and butter of any blues musician. If you want to sit in with the real players, you need to have a rock solid grasp on playing over the 12 bar blues....and by the final lesson of this VOl. I, you will have mastered soloing over the 12 bar blues.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Depending on your skill level coming into this course, you might find the first lesson a bit easy. Nevertheless, please follow along. Each lesson in the course builds upon the lesson that precedes it. Skip a lesson, and you risk missing an important aspect of blues soloing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  As the title suggests, you can finish the course in 21 days.  </p>",
