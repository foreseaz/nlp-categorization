This course presents 6 songs by blues legends Robert Johnson and Scrapper Blackwell, two giants of acoustic blues guitar. You will learn all songs in great detail. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        Each song is covered in one video lasting between 15 and 25 minutes, which also includes on-screen guitar tablature and a PDF file for downloading for later study.  Everything needed to learn and play the song is included. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          Scrapper Blackwell songs - Blues Day Blues, Down and Out, Kokomo Blues and Blues Before Sunrise. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t           Robert Johnson - Me and the Devil, and Love In Vain. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        The level is not super complex, but you should have some experience in finger picking guitar techniques and changing basic chords - you will also be learning (probably) some new blues chord structures.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Jim Bruce was voted NÂ°2 Internet Guitar Instructor by Truefire in 2013.  </p>  <!-- Perfect Audience - Udemy Pixel - DO NOT MODIFY -->  <img src=\"http://ads.perfectaudience.com/seg?add=2465989&amp;t=2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\" max-width:100%;\" />  <!-- End of Audience Pixel -->",
