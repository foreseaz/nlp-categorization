This course has a very logical structure and is cleverly designed so that pseudo beginners like me or even complete beginners can profit and learn a lot from these lectures. Every lesson is build on the previous one or extends the previous to a further aspect of drumming. Almost every lesson has pdf file and some have audio clips with the material made even more accessible and to practice separately. Already in lesson 10 there are some improvisations possible with the fills and the variations and i enjoyed this very much. Lesson 13 gives an insight how to transfer the techniques and rudiments around the tom-toms. This freedom to play around almost enlightened me and motivated to practice even more. I do not want to rush through the lessons, so that i have enough pleasure still waiting for me... thank you very much, Mike - this is a great course!!!
