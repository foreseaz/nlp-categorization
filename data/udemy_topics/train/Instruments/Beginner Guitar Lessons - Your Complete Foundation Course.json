    "description": "<p>The Frethub Foundation Course for contemporary guitar - taught by top UK session guitarists Bobby Harrison and Nick Radcliffe - is a crash-course that we hope will get you playing well in a relatively short space of time, since we’ve cut out any unnecessary exercises and just kept the valuable stuff. Whether you’re into rock, metal, country, blues or jazz, the techniques and approaches presented in these lessons apply to all styles of modern music. We teach you all of the essential chords, scales and techniques you need to be able to play in a band, write your own songs or to simply make good music at home. You don’t need to be able to read music to learn with FretHub and we’ve even cut out the need to read guitar Tab, since everything is explained thoroughly, in a note-for-note fashion. </p>\n\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: The Promo video for this course is designed to represent all of our courses available on this website. However our Foundation course should prepare you sufficiently to be able to tackle the more advanced techniques on display, so why not give us a try and most importantly....have fun!</p>",
