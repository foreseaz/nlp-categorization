Acoustic blues <strong>guitar</strong> is where it all started really. In the beginning, rhythmic strumming patterns turned into a basic finger picking pattern and gradually became more and more complex as players tried to invent other styles and basically out-do other <strong>guitar</strong> players!</p><p>No matter how complex <strong>guitar </strong>arrangements become, the basic movements are identical to the ones we first learn. These first steps in playing acoustic blues <strong>guitar</strong> are crucial - the rest of your playing career depends upon them!<br></p><!-- Perfect Audience - Udemy Pixel - DO NOT MODIFY -->    <!-- End of Audience Pixel -->",
