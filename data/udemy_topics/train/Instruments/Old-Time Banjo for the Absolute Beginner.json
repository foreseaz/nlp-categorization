It is a great old style of banjo playing that plays the melody of the song with the index finger, while adding a brush chord and pluck of the 5th string to the mix. It emphasizes the melody, but is also a great accompiament to singing and an easy start to playing the banjo. It is also a great way to transition into the bluegrass/three-finger style of playing most are familiar with. No note reading or musical experience necessary! All that is needed is an excitement and willingness to learn! Let&#039;s get started!  </p>",
