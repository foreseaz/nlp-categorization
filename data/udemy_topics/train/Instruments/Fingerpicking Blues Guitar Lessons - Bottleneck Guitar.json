For example, it isn';t necessary to hold down the bass E string when playing a D chord - a deeper bass gives the guitar a low down, bluesy feel but also lends itself to ragtime picking.  The acoustic guitar lessons in this course explains how to tune down to open D and open G, and presents several videos teaching a variety of songs in these tunings. <br>  \t<br>  \t           Open G guitar tuning is of particular interest and we take a look how Robert Johnson, King of Delta Blues Guitar used it to create songs such as Walkin' Blues and Crossroads.  </p>  <p>  \t        Jim Bruce was voted NÂ°2 Internet Guitar Instructor by Truefire in 2013.  </p>  <!-- Perfect Audience - Udemy Pixel - DO NOT MODIFY -->    <!-- End of Audience Pixel -->",
