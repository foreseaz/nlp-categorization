    "description": "<p>This course is unique because it is only a starting point in your musical training with our school, and not a quick fix course that will teach you nothing of lasting value. We provide traditional piano instruction quality, at fraction of the cost!  Most of online courses in music offer just the beginner level, and no support from the teacher. Students are left on their own, which can only lead to development of bad habits that are much harder to unlearn later on. </p>\n\n<p>Our program is different! We have courses available to levels as advanced as the student is willing to go in his or her journey of mastering the instrument, and the student is supported every step of the way by easily available progress reports, and one-on-one Master classes.  </p>\n\n<p>Our school is the only school offering a 3 Year Distant Education Popular piano program, and an 8 Year Professional Classical Piano program leading to a Diploma in Music by reputable, and globally recognized ABRSM Royal Schools of Music. </p>\n\n<p>Taking this course will introduce you to a life long musical journey that has potential to fulfill and change your life. </p>",
