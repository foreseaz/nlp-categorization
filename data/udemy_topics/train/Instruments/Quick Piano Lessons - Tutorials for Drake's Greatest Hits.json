These lectures do not have to be watched in sequence (ie, they can be viewed in any particular order depending on your song interest). The typical format is as follows.</p><ol><li>I will play the main loop/bridge of the song</li><li>Break down of the Right Hand notes</li><li>Break down of the Left Hand notes</li></ol><p>Due to the intricacies of certain songs or for the sake of time, specific songs will be taught both hands at the same time. Annotated sheet music is available to download for each song in this course. After completing this course, you may begin to notice the chord patterns used in the production of this particular artist's songs. Pay particularly close attention to the use of <em>Major 7ths </em>and <em>Minor 7ths</em>.</p><p>Keyboard used: Motif XS (with sustain pedal)</p>",
