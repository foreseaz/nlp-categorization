    "description": "<p>Economy Picking is a very efficient way to play super-fast picking licks and runs and there are plenty in this series of lessons. Economy picking is essentially where sweep picking and alternate picking meet.</p><p>Top UK session guitarist, Bobby Harrison starts by showing you the mechanics of this great technique, but very soon you’ll have a whole bag of great, rapid-fire licks and runs that you can incorporate into your own playing.</p><p>You’ll also learn: how to practice with a metronome; “Inside” picking runs; combining economy picking with hammer-ons, pull-offs and legato licks, plus some cool string-skipping and pentatonic ideas, taking your lead playing to exciting new heights!</p>",
