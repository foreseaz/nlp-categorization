Trying to get good at changing between chords can feel like banging your head against a brick wall and is the <strong>primary reason most guitarists give up the guitar</strong> and let it gather dust in the attic along with their guitar playing dreams.</p><p>The truth according to research is that over 92% of guitarists give up the guitar within the first 6 months of playing, and a large number of those cite \"slow chord changes\" or \"stopping between chords\" as the main reason for giving up.  <br></p><p>That equals a lot of money, time, effort and guitar playing dreams gathering dust in the attic. You don`t have to be one of those people...</p><p>The course is for anyone including <strong>ALL beginner electric and acoustic guitarists </strong>- I define a beginner guitarist as someone who has played for less than 1 year - who struggle with chords changes no matter how long you have been playing.<br></p><p> Learn through our videos, eBooks and audio supplementary guides the powerful steps to help you master the `dark arts` of changing chords.</p><p>In<strong> less than 30 days</strong> if you follow the course and apply the knowledge on a regular basis you will notice effective, powerful improvements. Your chord changes and fingers will feel faster and you will be more relaxed allowing you to truly feel free with the guitar for the first time.</p><p>You will finally be able to play songs without those annoying little stops between chord changes.<br></p><p>Impress your friends with your fluency and new found guitar skills.</p><p>You will be <strong>free from the struggles and frustrations of changing chords</strong> and you can finally feel joy through the guitar.</p><p>Don`t forget, there's not only the Udemy guarantee but my personal promise that the course is good.

I wish I had this course in the beginning. If I had, I would have made quicker progress than I made on my own.</p><p>Even with the experience I do have, there are lessons in this course and steps in the free bonus guide that helped me learn to play my chords better and faster. They even help me “correct” some bad habits I picked up along the way.</p><p>The lessons on finger stretching exercises, practice tips, practice exercises, strumming tips, strumming patterns, and tips on improving my rhythm skills helped me the most.</p><p>Thanks Dan for offering this course.”</p><hr><p><strong>Larry Arsenault – “Excellent instruction!”</strong></p><p>“I’ll get right to the point…If you want to become a better guitar player then buy this course! I have struggled with chord changes for years and lacked fluency in most of what I was able to play. I got so used to hearing those “pauses” and felt I just wasn’t fast enough.</p><p>What I have learned is that, it is not speed, but technique! The information in this course is fun to learn, fun to practice and you will get results.</p><p>They are simple, but very powerful!</p><p>He explains the most common mistakes that can hold you back or prevent you from being able to perform chord changes effectively and then gives a plethora of exercises you can use to overcome those mistakes. Wait until you see the section on capos…just brilliant.</p><p>A nice addition is the 38 page supplementary guide that you can print out and practice even when you are away from the computer.”</p><p>Overall, you will learn more in this course for less than you would spend for a professional lesson or two. There is so much information packed in this course you will want to view it several times. I think this course will appeal to beginners, intermediates and even seasoned players.</p><p>The video quality and sound is perfect. Very well taught, easy to understand and highly recommended!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Get the course today to master this area of your guitar playing!</strong></p>",
