    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this course, I will share with you the techniques of improvisation on the piano on the example of <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">improvising classical variations</strong></em> on a theme &quot;<strong style=\"\">twinkle twinkle little star</strong>&quot;. As a bonus, there is an improvisation on a &quot;smoke on the water&quot; theme.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Most important, I will share with you the <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">way of thinking</strong></em> while you&#039;re improvising in order to exceed the musical quality of your improvisations.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Also, you can use principles which I&#039;ve described here in your own compositions while <strong style=\"\">writing music</strong>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      If you play piano like amateur or if you are student in musical university - doesn&#039;t care: you can use the ideas in the range of skills you have.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Also, it&#039;s not important to be a piano player: if you play some other instrument, this course might be useful for you as well. The main thing I&#039;m going to talk about is the way of thinking in musical terms. And music itself can be played on any instrument, of course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You will learn a branch of stuff about improvising on a theme:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">presentation of a theme</li>  \t<li style=\"\">variations with different musical texture</li>  \t<li style=\"\">variations in field of harmony</li>  \t<li style=\"\">variatig the melody</li>  \t<li style=\"\">setting free and giving chance a chance</li>  \t<li style=\"\">changing the mood, changing scales</li>  \t<li style=\"\">seeking for new types of expression</li>  \t<li style=\"\">changing figurative sphere of music, improving it</li>  </ul>",
