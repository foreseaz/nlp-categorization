Everything starts off so simply and then suddenly you are expected to do things that you weren't prepared for? Then this is your course.</p><p>Welcome to the <strong>musendo</strong> acoustic guitar series.

Finally we will give you opportunities to play along with real music so you can show off your new skills!<br><br>All of the teaching material for our lessons was created by leading music pedagogues based off of curriculum used by the Sibelius Academy and other Finnish university music programs.</p><p>By the end of this course and with lots of practice, you should feel comfortable playing and alternating between different chords on your guitar, keeping basic time, and playing along to real music.<br></p>",
