I wanted to play popular music in night clubs, cabarets, casinos and show rooms. I learned more from working with other professional musicians than I ever did from teachers, either privately or in school.  </p>  <p>  \t                  What I show you in this course are the things that I learned to make music easy, effective and fun.
