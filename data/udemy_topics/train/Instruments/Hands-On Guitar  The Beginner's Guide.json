    "description": "<p>Welcome to your first guitar lesson!  Some of you may be complete beginners never having held a guitar before, and some may have picked it up on your own but don’t feel like you’ve really mastered the basics.  Either way, this course is for you.  The guitar is an easy instrument to get good at quickly and within a few lessons you’ll be playing songs.  Playing the guitar is a skill that you’ll have for the rest of your life.  It’s a perfect relaxation tool, great socially, and both fun and easy. </p><p>I find that most beginning lessons either focus only on reading notes (which would bore me to death), or only on basic folk strumming and chords (and I like all styles of music).  These lessons will give you an introduction to several different styles and all the lessons apply to either acoustic or electric guitar players.  We’ll begin with shopping for a guitar and basic technique.  By the time you finish the lessons you’ll be playing chords, well known riffs, tablature, fingerstyle,power chords, a twelve-bar blues, and a pentatonic scale.  In the end, you’ll have a taste of all the basics and you can continue your lessons concentrating on the style that you like best.  So lets get going and get our “Hands-On Guitar!”</p>",
