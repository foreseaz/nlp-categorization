    "description": "<p>This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn the basics of fingerpicking style guitar.  Whether you are brand new to guitar playing or have been playing for a while but have not yet explored the wonderful world of fingerpicking style guitar, this course will give you a solid foundation for a lifetime of fingerpicking fun!  The course uses multi-cam videos to give you a clear perspective on both the left and right hand techniques (naturally, this course focuses on the right hand).  Fingerpicking Fundamentals is broken into 3 sections:  1) A series of lessons teaching a style commonly called \"Travis Picking\".  2) A series of lessons developing a technique I call \"Finger Rolls\".  Together these two basic styles will give you the facility in your right hand to master almost any popular fingerpicking song you want to learn.  Finally, 3) A series of practice sessions using a chord progression in the key of E that allows the student to practice all the patterns learned in the course while developing facility across all 6 strings.  Take this course if you want to get a huge head start on becoming a master fingerpicking guitarist!  </p>",
