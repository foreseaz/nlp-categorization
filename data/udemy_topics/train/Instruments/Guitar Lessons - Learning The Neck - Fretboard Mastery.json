Note-finding excercises and visualisation formulas are covered as well as the famous CAGED system. The CAGED system enables you to play any chord or scale by recalling just 5 shapes. It’s also very useful for soloing as well as aiding songwriting and composition.<br></p><p>You can choose to study this module in its entirety or use it as reference material, dipping in and out while you continue to study the other lessons Frethub has available. Either way, this course will soon have you flying effortlessly all over the neck.</p>",
