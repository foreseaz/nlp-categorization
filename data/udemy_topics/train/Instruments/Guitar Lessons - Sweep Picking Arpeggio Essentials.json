    "description": "<p>Sweep picking arpeggios are a very effective way to play super fast, fluid, melodic arpeggios and melodies all over the neck. In this exciting series, Top UK session guitarist, Bobby Harrison gives you an in-depth course on the technique.</p><p>You will start by learning some of the more bluesy applications of sweep picking, before going on to cover major, minor and diminished sweeps across three strings, then huge, five-string sweep arpeggios. You can follow chord progressions using these shapes, adding an extra dimension to your lead playing.</p><p>Bobby also shows you how to harmonise fast sweeps in a two guitar band or when layering guitar parts in the studio as well as showing you how to further extend your harmonic palette, using bigger major 7th, minor 7th, dominant 7th and minor 7 flat 5 sweep arpeggios.</p><p>A course not to be missed!</p>",
