    "description": "<p>If you are an absolute beginner on guitar then this course is right for you!  All you need is a tuned guitar and a pic to get started!  You will learn basic open chords like C, Am, E, D, G and A.  Then you will put them together to play along to hits from Eric Clapton, U2 and Bob Marley.  There are 11 detailed lessons available and ideally it will take you 2-3 months to complete the course.  Upon completion you will play along to Knockin' On Heaven's Door, Sweet Home Alabama, Stir It Up, Fly Away, Hang on Sloopy, and With or Without You.  Finally there is a beginner course that not only teaches you songs, but shows you how to play along to them!</p>",
