I spend a great deal of time and money producing my guitar courses, and I personally guarantee you won't find a teacher who cares more about their students and takes the time to respond to EVERY video or question.  If you ever need anything, I will be there for you, and if you put in the time, you can do this and have a LOT of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please check out my reviews from this and my other courses!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Lastly - with Udemy you get a 5 min free preview and a 30-day no-questions-asked guarantee.
