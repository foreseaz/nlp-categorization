This is the kind of music that is very relaxing and soothing for meditation or dining with family and beloved friends. </p>    <p>It’s the choice of chords that you choose to create the nostalgic atmosphere with sweet sounds.</p>    <p>When these chords are put together, it has a magical feel that is timeless and elegantly graceful.  This kind of music brings hope and pleasure to our lives.  After playing such music, one’s spirit feels lifted up in the journey. The musical path is one of delight and joy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Silver Bells is a very special Christmas Song.</strong>  Even though the melody of Silver Bells is very plain.  If you take a look at the music score of Silver Bells, you will be able to pick up some very unique features in this song.<br></p><p><strong>One of the unique feature of the song is the ‘accidental’ note</strong> that occurs in 2 places in Section A.  Think of the accidental note as a<strong> ‘flat’ </strong>rather than a ‘sharp’.</p><p>Once you think of that note as a ‘flat’, you will be able to create a very <strong>smooth chromatic chord movement</strong> in that section to highlight the unique feature of this song.   And when you can figure out the great chromatic movement chord progression, you can put it into the Turn Around and in the Ending of the Song.<br></p><p><strong>Another very Unique Feature of the song</strong> is that there are many empty measures in Section B.  Usually in empty measures, we can put in all kinds of runs and fills.</p><p>For “Silver Bells”, I refrain from putting in just any kind of runs and fills.   We can certainly fill up those empty measures with ballad style of playing, and many of the runs and fills I presented to you in White Christmas.</p><p><strong>Silver Bells with its repeated m</strong>elodic notes give us many opportunities to do Dreamy Echoes in the empty measures.  When we hear bells, we want to hear echoes.  I will demonstrate<strong> 8 Different kinds of dreamy echoes</strong> for you to learn how you too can create your own dreamy echoes.  You need to learn some improvisational skills.</p><p><strong>In this course, I show you a 4 Level CHORD METHOD to produce Dreamy Music :</strong></p><p>1.  How to Create Chord Progressions to Create Dreamy Music.</p><p>2.  There are 4 Different Levels of Chord Progressions you can create.</p><p>3.
