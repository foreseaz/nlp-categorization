    "description": "<p>In Webisodes 1 &amp; 2 (Intro &amp; Gear) of my <em>Bluegrass Guitar Essentials</em> series, you’ll learn about the <strong>influences</strong> that helped shape the way I play guitar, more specifically Bluegrass guitar.  Famous <em>Legendary</em> guitarists such as <strong>Tony Rice</strong>,<strong> Bryan Sutton</strong>, and <strong>David Grier</strong>—to name a few—are some of the <em>Masters</em> of the genre that I’ve designed this entire series around so that you can really “Learn the <em>Essentials</em> of Playing Bluegrass Guitar like the <em>Legends</em>!”</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also learn <strong>which gear I personally use</strong> in my every day playing and gigging as well as <strong>what gear I recommend</strong> for <strong>Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced players</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An Introduction to the course, a section on How to Use the Ebooks for the course, as well as a <strong>special BONUS section</strong> containing <strong>links</strong> to all the gear I discuss—as well as gear I’ve learned about <em>since originally recording the series</em>—are included in the companion ebooks available in the resources area.</p>",
