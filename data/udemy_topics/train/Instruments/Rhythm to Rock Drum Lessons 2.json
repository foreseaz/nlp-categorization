    "description": "<p>  \t Rhythm to Rock Drum Lessons 2 is the second lesson in a series of drum lessons designed to teach reading music for drums.  The lessons are best learned in order.  Before signing up for this lesson make sure you sign up for and learn lesson 1 &quot;Rhythm to Rock Drum Lessons&quot;.  The video series follows my method book &quot;Nelsons Great Big Drum Book&quot;.  </p>  <p>  \t This lesson series is the same as signing up for drum lessons at a local music store, or signing up for drum lessons in a school band program.  Although the video format does not allow for personalized instruction, it does allow for repeated use of the presented material.  Students aged 10 and up can utilize the series to teach themselves to play and read drum music.  </p>  <p>  \t For this lesson you will need the same things you used in lesson 1.  After a week of working with this lesson you will be ready for &quot;Rhythm to Rock Lesson 3&quot;.  </p>",
