You would learn exploit development by means of hands-on labs. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What you will get?</strong></p><p>This course includes <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">3 hours of lecture videos</strong> which teaches exploit development by practices. We have also added <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">one quiz consisting of 25 questions on exploit development. </strong>You will also get <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">courseware PDF</strong> which have been used during the videos.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What you will learn?\n\n  </strong></p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Exploit development in a nutshell and core concepts, tools and techniques which are building blocks for anyone who wants to learn exploit development in fast pace. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>You will learn how to discover buffer overflow vulnerabilities in FTP Servers, Email Server and how to discover weaknesses in web servers. In any exploit development and research, fuzzing place an important role, this course will teach you different methods of fuzzing. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>You will learn how to code fuzzers and real working exploits. Follow the pace of course and you should be able to write your own working exploit as explained in the course.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>We believe this course is really informative for exploit development, we do not claim it will take you from zero to infinity but you will get what we have explained here.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>You will rock once you develop your first working exploit after completing the course, however following instructions is a must.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>\n\n  </p>\n\n",
