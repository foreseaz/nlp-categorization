    "description": "<p>Juniper is Awesome! This is what you will think once you understand what Junos Operating system has to offer.</p><p>The\n Entire Course is Split into several parts and this is part-1a of the \ncourse where we take a Deep Dive into fundamentals of Static-Routing, \nAggregate Routing, Generated Route, Martian Routes ( Nothing to Do with \nMovie) and what Not.</p><p>I love teaching and I have a Passion towards \nit. I Have made it as hands on as possible instead of Slide shows \nshowing outputs and then dealing everything about it. </p><p>Goal of \nthis course is to make engineer as practical as possible and ease \nhis/her way to implement/troubleshoot thing thinking at fundamental \nlevel.</p><p>This is the Part-1a of the Course. Course Covers the \nofficial Curriculum / Blue Print from Juniper Networks Certification \nPortal. </p><p>Identify the concepts, operation and functionality of various protocol-independent routing components<br></p><ol><li>Junos Architecture </li><li>A Detailed View at Routing-Table (Inet/inet.3/mpls/inet.6)</li><li>Static Routing / Aggregate Routing / Generated Route / Martian Address Space </li></ol><p>Audience </p><p>Network Engineers who has knowledge on Basic TCP/IP </p><p>Engineers who would like to see additional concepts and knobs at a specialist level certification of JNCIS-SP/ENT </p><p>Materials : </p><p>All the Demonstrations are covered over a virtual platform </p><p>This\n is done to demonstrate the power of Junos now at a virtual level , \nthanks to VMX / VSRX and also give a push to someone who wants to learn \nJunos and still think that he needs hardware for the same </p><p>How Long would it take to complete this Course ?</p><p>This course should take no greater than 3 Hours to complete.</p><p>This includes in-depth analysis of all the concepts and different knobs that Junos has to offer.</p><p>Why Take this Course  ? </p><p>- To get help in certification track of Famous Jncis-SP/ENT tracks<br></p><p>- To understand more about Juniper Networks </p><p>- To advance your configurational and troubleshooting expertise </p><p>Course Structure </p><p>-&gt; Course-Summary and Intro</p><p>-&gt; What is Part-1a of this course </p><p>-&gt; Architectural view of Junos</p><p>-&gt; Routing-Tables </p><p>-&gt; Next-Hop categories </p><p>-&gt; Static Routes </p><p>-&gt; Static Routes at Global/Routing-Instance/logical-system Level </p><p>-&gt; Next-Hop / Qualified Next-Hops </p><p>-&gt; Aggregate Routes and their Implementations </p><p>-&gt; Generated Route and their implementations </p><p>-&gt; Martian Routes and Tweaking Martian-Route Space </p><p>Equipment and Lab Demonstrations </p><p>-&gt; All the Labs are Build on VMware workstation12 using VSRX/CISCO IOL / VMX </p><p>-&gt; Initial setups were build on VSRX and then the later labs were executed on VMX setup using Logical systems <br></p><p>This\n is purely done keeping one thing in mind as i have re-iterated earlier,\n the goal of this course is to make it as practical as possible along \nwith exploring the user-friendly options where students who enrol for \nthis course can take a better advantage by setting up their own systems \nwithout worrying about hardware. I have also made sure that this entire \ncourse can run on a single VMX Instance of Junos which consume a 2GB ram and 2vcpu </p><p>I hope you enjoy this course as much as I did developing it.</p><p>Cheers <br></p>",
