During this course you’ll get into Windows passwords — how they’re created, how they’re stored, and different methods used to crack them. You’ll discover different methods used for guessing passwords and breaking the different security methods used within the Windows operating system. You’ll find discussions on responding to privilege escalation. You’ll also spend some time going through a couple of scenarios demonstrating how to use key defense tools. Overall, the topics explored here will teach you how to increase security on your Windows machines, as well as show you required procedures and tools to prepare for different certification exams from EC-Council, CompTIA, Linux, and CISSP.</span>  </p>",
