The differences are not only in the appearance of your colorful desktop and icons, but also a lot of new security solutions.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Just think whether your computer actually belongs to you? Are you sure that in your network doesn&#039;t appear suspicious traffic? Hackers attack using automated techniques at the same time, hundreds of thousands of computers, often for fun and &quot;blindly&quot;. So it is not a matter of IF you will be a victim of the attack, but WHEN it will happen.  </p>  <p>  \t  Most Windows users do not use the built-in security mechanisms, which are provided by the system itself. For this reason, the client&#039;s machines very often become a zombie machines that remotely (without the user&#039;s knowledge), are used by hackers. Meanwhile, the correct configuration can prevent the majority of currently used attacks!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Windows 8: Hacking &amp; Securing </strong>is recommended to people who benefit from this system either for personal or professional purposes.
