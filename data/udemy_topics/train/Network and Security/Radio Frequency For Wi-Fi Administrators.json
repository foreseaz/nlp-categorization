    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course is one of the first steps in understanding the wonderful, exciting, and ever-growing world of Wi-Fi. The most distinctive difference between wired and wireless networking is the physical layer. While we take the wire for granted, radio frequency (RF) is anything but absolute.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This course isn&#039;t narrated PowerPoints. It&#039;s me in my favorite place to teach, in front of a whiteboard, explaining difficult topics in such a way that you will understand them.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Whether you are looking to achieve your CWNA certification or just learn all about Wi-Fi, this course is for you. While you don&#039;t need any books to go with this course, if you want a great Wi-Fi book I highly recommend the CWNA study guide by Dave Coleman and David Wescott. There are multiple versions so make sure you get the latest. Even if you aren&#039;t looking to get certified this is the best Wi-Fi book you can own. Plus, it will help you with other Wi-Fi courses by me!  </p>",
