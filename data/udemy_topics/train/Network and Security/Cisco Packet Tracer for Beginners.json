    "description": "<p>  \t      In this course, you will learn the basics of designing a network with the help of a simulator called Cisco Packet Tracer. We will make use of certain components for the proper implementation of the network. I&#039;ll be explaining how to include routers, switches, computers, and transmission media, and how to bind them together with the help of protocols to enable successful communication between them.  </p>  <p>  \t      This course will introduce the students to the basic handling and functioning of Cisco networking components and their simulated behaviour in a real network. At the end of every module, the students will encounter a quiz to brush up on what they have learnt throughout the module. So, see you in class then!  </p>",
