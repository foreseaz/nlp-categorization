    "description": "<p style=\"\">Many developers have been turning to Virtual Private Servers to host their projects, and with good reason: unlike in a shared hosting environment, you are not running the risk of someone else&#039;s badly written code resulting in poor performance or (worse yet) your site being compromised because of someone else&#039;s insecure programming. But setting up a secure VPS takes a bit of work. This course will take you through the basics of setting up a fast, secure VPS on either DigitalOcean or Vultr. We&#039;ll set up an Ubuntu 14.04 server with the most commonly needed software.</p>",
