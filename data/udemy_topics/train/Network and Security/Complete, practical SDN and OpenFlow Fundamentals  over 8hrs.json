Learn SDN and OpenFlow practically. You can set up everything shown here on your laptop using free or demo software.</p><p><strong>Learn all tiers of the SDN Architecture:</strong></p><p>* Applications - Wireshark, Bash scripts, FlowMaker, HP Network Protector, HP Network Visualizer</p><p>* Controllers - Learn OpenDaylight (ODL), ONOS, RYU and the HP VAN SDN Controllers.</p><p>* OpenFlow Infrastructure - Mininet switches (Open vSwitch)</p><p><strong>Wireshark:</strong><br></p><p>Capture OpenFlow messages using both Linux and Windows based Wireshark.</p><p><strong>Technical content:</strong><br></p><p>No sales hype, no fluff. Just technical content.</p><p><strong>OVAs:</strong></p><p>As part of the course, I have made OVAs available of ODL, RYU and the HP VAN SDN Controller. I have also provided links to download OVAs directly for ONOS and Mininet.</p><p><strong>Real world SDN examples:</strong></p><p>* The NSA</p><p>* Google</p><p>* Microsoft Azure</p><p>* Facebook</p><p>* Microsoft Linux</p><p><strong>Update 10 November 2015:</strong></p><p>Based on feedback, additional videos discussing the installation of apps on the HP controller have been added:</p><p>* Install HP Controller</p><p>* Troubleshoot browser issues</p><p>* Install FlowMaker on HP Controller</p><p>* Troubleshoot app install issues</p><p><strong>Update 25 October 2015:</strong></p><p>Additional videos added to the course discussing:</p><p>* Do you need to replace switches to use SDN?</p><p>* Do you need to run OpenFlow everywhere in your network?</p><p>* How does OpenFlow and Spanning Tree interact?</p><p>* Does a single controller manage the entire network?</p>",
