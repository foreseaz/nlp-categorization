Welcome to \"Protect Kids Identity Online\" course. </p>  <p>My name is David Cassar and I will talk you step-by-step through six essential lessons. I am  an expert at helping kids create their own online money making empire. Even I didn't put two and two together until that day when one of my parent-students asked me if I've seen that new study. The New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering and NYU Shanghai recently released a study showing how parents' every day habits on popular social media sites are easily allowing online predators to find out who their child is, approximately how old they are, exactly where they live, how to reach out to their child...and even their schedule...in mere minutes. After reading it, I was so terrified that I dug deep into the statistics to find out what's really behind the smoke and mirrors, to identify how my students can keep their kids safe online. </p>",
