No experience is required, although any programming knowledge would be an asset.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tYou will start with an overview of Python, including how to create and run scripts, use threads, and handle exceptions. From there, Ric will teach you how to network, including how to use the Python libraries for network scripting and develop basic scripts with network functionality. This video tutorial will also cover HTTP programming, security scripting, and forensic scripting. Finally, you will learn about Twisted Python, including the Echo server and HTTP client. Once you have completed the course, you will be fully capable of debugging and security testing using Python, as well as writing Python scripts. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.  </p>",
