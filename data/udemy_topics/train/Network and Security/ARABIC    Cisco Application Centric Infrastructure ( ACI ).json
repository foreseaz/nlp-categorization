Current Data Center network infrastructures must cope with the required elasticity to scale up or down on-demand. Customers must be able to easily add/remove services or workloads  in their data center infrastructure without having to go through extended lead times of design, deploy, test and commission phases of every single change to be made, this is not working anymore. The answer to these challenges is the introduction of Software Defined Networks (SDN), of which Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is the Cisco version.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Turning the blind eye to these changes as a network professional and how they could impact will not work, network professionals need to adapt and learn these skills asap or stay behind of the game.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud and similar new trends are here to stay, forecasts of tens of billions dollars for cloud business over the next 3-5 years. It is becoming imperative to start mastering these skills. Cisco being the largest market share holder in LANs and DC network infrastructure, Cisco’s SDN solution, ACI, becomes a priority to learn.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This will not only take your skill level to the next step, but will also make you amongst the very limited and scarce pool of network professionals  who master these solutions. This mastery would potentially result in job moves with much higher pay levels.\n\n \n\n Join this course now, and stay at the top with the networking professionals who are on very high demand, Act Now!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn and Master the most common and talked about SDN solution in the industry today!</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This course will teach you:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Application      Centric Infrastructure (ACI)\n\n</li><li>ACI      policy model\n\n</li><li>ACI      logical constructs and building blocks\n\n</li><li>ACI      networking (Layer 2, Layer 3)\n\n</li><li>ACI      integration with virtual environments\n\n</li><li>Migration      to ACI\n\n</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mastering ACI starts with this course </strong><br> <br> \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Overview </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Broken down, this course constitutes a comprehensive high-level technical introduction to Cisco ACI. Today, the Data Center (DC) network infrastructures are not coping with the demands of hot IT trends such as Cloud, Big Data where the network is required to be flexible and responds to required changes dynamically, with the least required manual intervention possible.  Software Defined Networks (SDNs), is the answer and solution to these challenges, and Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is Cisco’s SDN solution for the DC network challenges faced today.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Course Contents</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with where we stand today, classical Data Center (DC) network infrastructures, and how things are being done today, where manual intervention required in almost every single task we do to change/enhance/upgrade networks. This course then explains Software Defined Networks (SDN), at a high level, as an answer to classical DC network infrastructure problems. Then ACI, which is Cisco’s SDN solution, is explained starting from the theoretical (policy) model, through how ACI fabric is built, its components, and then gets into the explanation of how logically the ACI fabric functions, how it is controlled by Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) , the function of each, and how they communicate to instantiate the intended state. ACI can’t function without connecting to the surrounding/existing network (LAN, WAN), hence, this course also explains the available connectivity options from ACI to existing networks, this will cover Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity options, and then once this is understood the course talks about adding other components/services to the Data Center, it explains how NG Firewalls, Load Balancer, SSL off-load functions are added to the ACI fabric to give it the required services common in data centers. Nexus 9000 Hardware is then explained briefly to give you an understanding of what hardware can be used for ACI solutions.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One step further, the course introduces, at a high level, how to migrate the existing physical and virtual workloads from the existing DC network to ACI based DC network. Last but not least, the course gets into application health, and how ACI monitors that closely with a very deep visibility into application flows, delay, latency, security, QoS and other application related statistics in real time. Covering all this in an introduction course basically, gives you the ability to skim through ACI’s different aspects and understand carefully the benefits and simplification ACI provides and how it constitutes an answer to SDN requirements. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course then concludes by providing a road map of next learning steps for those who want to dig deeper into ACI solution, by understanding more of its functionality, exploring more features and migration details, and learn how to configure ACI from the GUI interface. This should make it easier for you to decide on your next learning steps to reach full mastery of ACI skills.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is perfect for any Data Center network focused IT professional who needs to  explore new, SDN based, solutions to enhance or refresh existing classical DC networks. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong> </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What am I going to get from this course? </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Upon completion, you would have completed your first and most important step in your journey to ACI mastery.
