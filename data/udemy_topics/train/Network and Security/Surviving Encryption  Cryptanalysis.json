    "description": "<p>  \t  This class reviews decryption analysis tools from the open source community.  There are plenty of no cost or low cost decryption solutions available to the forensic examiner.  The problem is they are scattered and it would take significant time for any one person to research and test just a few.  SUMURI has done the work for you and put together training featuring some of the best open source tools available.  Students will learn how to build different types of word lists for dictionary attacks, how to create rainbow tables, tools for attacking Windows and Mac user passwords, attacking Mac keychains, recovering Internet passwords from Windows systems, and attacking password hashes.   Topics will also include using open source tools such as Inception, John the Ripper, Hashcat, and more.  </p>",
