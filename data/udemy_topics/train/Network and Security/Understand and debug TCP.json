The performance of the transmission is impacted by many TCP details and performance analysis and optimization requires a good background on TCP. Finding and fixing issues will also not be possible without understanding the protocol. After this course you will be able to find faults, check options and understand the performance.</p>\n\n<p>This is a self-paced course, you are free to learn whenever you have time. If you complete the course you will get a certificate.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
