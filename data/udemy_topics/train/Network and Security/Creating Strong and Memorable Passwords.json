    "description": "<p>Do you use passwords for places like your Facebook or Email accounts? Do you worry about your password being hacked? Then this is the course for you. </p>\n\n<p>Since we all started creating passwords, they were designed to be difficult for a human to guess. Being short and using random numbers and letters worked wonders. Since computing power has increased exponentially, these passwords now are not only hard for humans to remember, they're super easy for a computer to guess. </p>\n\n<p>We've all been ingrained with the notion of how to create a secure password, but times have changed; and now the way you select your passwords needs to change, too. This course dives into why most passwords used today are weak, and how to make the switch to start creating passwords using two simple methods. We'll also touch on how password hints can be dangerous, how to protect your password and why those password strength meters might be lying to you!</p>",
