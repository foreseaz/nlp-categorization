Have you ever thought about starting a cloud storage business? Well, the first step is to get that server set up, and this course will teach you how!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>About the Course</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course walks you through setting up your own cloud storage service using Digital Ocean. You will be shown how to install, set up and administer everything you need to get your cloud server up and running. While learning server technologies on your own can be difficult and time consuming, this simple, step by step course will have you up and running in about 30 minutes. This course is what you&#039;re looking for!  </p>  <p>  \tWhat Can You Use Cloud Storage For?  </p>  <p>  \tLots of things! If you currently use a service like Google Drive or Dropbox, your own cloud server is an inexpensive and fun replacement, saving you money.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you&#039;re a web developer, mobile app developer or game developer, you can use your cloud server to archive files as well as test and run your applications and games.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you&#039;re an entrepreneur looking to break into the tech sector, you can use your server as a business. You can sell space to people who don&#039;t know how to set up their own server (99.9% of us), and create a monthly income stream for years to come.  </p>",
