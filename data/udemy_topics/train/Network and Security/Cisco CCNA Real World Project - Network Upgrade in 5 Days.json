You need some real world experience. I appreciate it might not be easy. That&#039;s why I came up with this unique idea and recorded <strong style=\"\">a real network refresh</strong> project. I use <strong style=\"\">a special action camera</strong> so you can see all details (racking, cabling etc.).  </p>  <p>  \t        If you are CCNA certified or you are studying towards that exam, you will get a chance to see a lot of topics from your book in action. This training will show you a network refresh project step by step. When things go wrong... I keep recording. There are no hidden or preconfigured tasks here. You will see everything live!  </p>  <p>  \t      <strong style=\"\">CCNA Real World Project covers:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Overview of project processes</li>  \t<li>Network diagrams</li><li>MS Project</li><li>Replacing core Cisco switches</li><li>Stacking Cisco switches</li><li>Etherchannels</li><li>IP SLA and failover</li><li>Firewalls</li>  \t<li>Adding a new gigabit switch</li>  \t<li>Racking and cabling</li>  \t<li>Troubleshooting network issues</li>  \t<li>Failover tests</li>  \t<li>Logging and monitoring</li><li>SNMP</li><li>Back-ups</li>  \t<li>Documentation</li>  \t<li>UPS testing &amp; installation</li><li>...and much more</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Contents and Overview</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                             In over 6 hours of content,  including 50 lectures, this course covers the full cycle of a simple network project.
