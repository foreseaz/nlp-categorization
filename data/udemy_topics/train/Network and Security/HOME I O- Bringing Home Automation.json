It&#039;s advised to use the faster than real time mode to observe these phenomena since they are typically slow. The existing coloured Minimap allows you to see how temperature changes inside every room.  </p>  <strong style=\"\">Analyse And Learn About Energy Efficiency</strong>  <p>  \t        Alter all the parameters of the house and learn about energy efficiency by observing and analysing the consumption of energy or cost per hour, day, week and month.  </p>",
