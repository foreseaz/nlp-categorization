And most of all it relies to Sales, Business development, IT and Project Managers who sells WiFi or manages WiFi projects. There are great technical deep dive classes for engineers from top WiFi vendors as well as cool generic marketing presentations or probably some good stuff on purpose. But what about sales or project people with WiFi specialization? Actually, what about completed intermediate layer? If you met the same issue â€“ Congratulations! - the course was specifically designed to fill in such gap. </p><p>The course includes 18 lectures with about 3.5 hours of video content.
