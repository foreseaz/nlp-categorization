This course managed to fill in those gaps in a way where I wasn't left scratching my head and off reading / watching other resources to understand what was being explained. The course is pitched perfectly for anyone looking to get into networking, covering all the basics in a logical, step by step manner. Also the length/delivery of each video I found pefect - I was able to do this entire course in just 4 days, making detailed notes as I went along.\"</em> - Jay<br></p>\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"This is one of the best courses I ever had - well-structured, excellently thought-through and very logically built.
