    "description": "<p>This course is a rigorous approach to basic Trigonometry. It sets out to show the foundations of the subject in a theoretical way. By reading a formal textbook, watching PowerPoints on each topic, and taking actual tests, students will gain a deep and thorough understanding of the necessities of the subject.</p><p>This course will teach concepts such as the sine, cosine, and tangent function, radian measure, the use of the Unit Circle, identities, and more. There are 15 lectures with almost 4 hours of content. Students will receive a full textbook (with selected answers) and have access to three tests is .pdf format.</p><p>This course has been designed to help introduce students to Trigonometry and its basic skills. High school students seeking to prepare themselves for a Pre-Calculus or year-long Trigonometry course are part of the main audience, but this course certainly can benefit others looking to review this material, or simply learn it from a more theoretical standpoint.</p>",
