    "description": "<p>Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities are very helpful to our understanding of the linear relationships. We can use linear models to represent many real life situations so it is not just an important concept to master for math but to also gain an understanding for in real life. By taking this course you will know how to graph equations and inequalities that will help you model more difficult real life situations.The course is broken down into five sections with each section containing an overview instructional video, worksheet where each problem has a video showing you how to solve the problem and a quiz at the end to test your skills. This course should take you about a week to complete and is designed to be used not only as an introductory course but as and aide to help you review or take in addition to a class.</p>",
