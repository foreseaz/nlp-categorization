In particular, you will </p><ul> <li>learn how to estimate bankruptcy risks,</li> <li>learn that in theory you can always win in a fair game, but in practice you should not attempt to do so,</li> <li>learn how to solve the problem from introduction, </li> <li>learn a paradox that puzzles even professional mathematicians.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
