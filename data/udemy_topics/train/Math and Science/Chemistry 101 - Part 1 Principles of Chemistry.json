The first lesson introduces the states of matter and atomic structure.&nbsp; In the next lesson we progress to relative formula mass and chemical equations - don&#039;t be put off by these as everything is very carefully explained!&nbsp; Lesson 3 covers chemical formulae, and we progress in lesson four to look at reacting masses, ionic bonding and covalent bonding.&nbsp; Lesson five wraps up this part of the course with metallic crystals and electrolysis.</p><p class=\"PIN_1372874451690_hazClick\">&nbsp;</p>  ",
