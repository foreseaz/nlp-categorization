This is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">important </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">information for you </strong>today because, even in our modern and advanced global society, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">we are not immune to the ravages of pandemics.</strong> The course is divided into <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">six sections</strong> (plus a <strong>Bonus </strong>section) with multiple lessons making up each section. While the section topics are broad, the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">lesson topics focus on specific ideas or concepts</strong>. The section topics are:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Introduction—1 lecture</li><li>What is a Pandemic?—5 lectures</li><li>What is Ebola?—5 lectures</li><li>Ebola: Signs &amp; Symptoms—5 lectures</li><li>Ebola around the World—5 lectures</li><li>Ebola Today—5 lectures </li><li>Bonus</li></ol>\n\n<p>The <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">26-lessons </strong>are presented in a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">narrative-slide format.</strong> Each lesson is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">fully illustrated</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Jonathan’s </strong>narration is clear, concise, and entertaining. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Average lesson length is approximately </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">six-minutes</strong> so the entire course can be easily completed by the diligent student in a single afternoon. There are also <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">four section quizzes</strong> and a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">final exam</strong> designed to evaluate the student’s understanding of the material presented. These evaluations are automatically scored and the student’s score is immediately presented upon completion. The <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">evaluations have no time limit</strong> and may be taken multiple times. Finally, the course is complete with an <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">interactive discussion board</strong> where students are able to ask <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Jonathan </strong>questions, request clarifications, and even interact with fellow students. </p><p>This course is perfect for <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">advanced and AP high school biology students, undergraduate science students, or anyone wanting to learn more</strong> about <em>Ebola</em>, disease and  disease transmission, or the natural world. </p><p>So join biology instructor <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Jonathan Jeffreys </strong>as he guides you on this unique and fascinating journey through the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Anatomy of a Pandemic: <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Ebola </em>Disease in the 21st Century. </strong></p><p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
