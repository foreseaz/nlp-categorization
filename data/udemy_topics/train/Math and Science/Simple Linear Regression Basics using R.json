It also fits for anybody who want to explore the field of statistics using R in any discipline. </p><p>We will start with an introduction section where I will explain the regression equation with a detailed example. Next, we will cover the essentials of modeling. At this section, I added an emphasis to data cleaning which is essential nowadays with big data issues. Then will follow visualization, modeling and diagnostics. </p><p>We will be using R studio which is a nice coding open source environment. R studio is suitable for academic and professional needs.</p><p>This course is important in the sense that data analysis needs are constantly growing with the emerging complexity of data. Quick data driven decisions need to be made at the management level. Data Analytics is the most efficient way to get the most accurate information to make decisions. </p>",
