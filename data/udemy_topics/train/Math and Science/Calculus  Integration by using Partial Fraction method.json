    "description": "<p>  \t  The course covers integration by using one of the most important method which is partial fraction method. The concept is clearly explained with the help of number of examples. There are even other ways to do integration which would be explained in the future courses.  </p>  <p>  \t  Coming back to our topic, when integrating functions involving polynomials in the denominator, partial fractions can be used to simplify integration. New students of Calculus will find it handy to learn how to decompose functions into partial fractions not just for integration, but for other aspects of Calculus as well, once they enter more advanced studies.  </p>",
