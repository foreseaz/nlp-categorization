But what you’ll learn in trigonometry is actually going to help you with shapes other than triangles, like circles. And you’ll use it all the time once you get to calculus.</p><p><strong>Key concepts</strong></p><p>The major topics we'll cover are:</p><ul><li>Angles</li><li>The unit circle</li><li>Trig functions and trig identities</li><li>Graphing trig functions</li><li>The law of sines and the law of cosines</li><li>Polar coordinates and graphing polar curves</li><li>Parametric curves<span></span></li></ul><p><strong>A complete course</strong></p><p>Currently, this is a video-only course. Over time, I'll continue to add notes, quizzes, and other video content to the course.</p>",
