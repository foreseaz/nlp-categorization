    "description": "<p>What I love about Udemy is that a lot of the courses teach you skills that you get to apply in the real world or that are focused. I think a lot of people worry about wasting their time on a course that they don’t see a practical benefit in, or that doesn't serve their specific need. I’ve made this course with that in mind. </p>\n\n<p>This course is specifically <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">relevant</strong> to those who are Psychology majors, those that want to pursue Psychology as a profession, or those that are curious about how stats are used in Psychology. You won’t waste your time learning portions of statistics that are not relevant to you, and the relevant concepts will be emphasized.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have attached <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">examples</strong> to the majority of the lectures to ensure that you can test yourself as you go.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course was also designed to emphasize <strong>links</strong> between concepts/lectures and explain why a certain lesson or concept is important to understand. As a result, it is ideal for those who might fear or be anxious about anything math related, or who think of themselves as non-math people.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Choose appropriate hypothesis test based on given information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>T-test (independent and repeated measures)</li><li>ANOVA (independent and repeated measures)</li><li>correlation (using the Pearson correlation)</li><li>linear regression </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the differences between the different tests/techniques is vital and so is understanding when each should be utilized.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Calculate test statistics correctly and confidently</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> You will get clear instructions on how to calculate each of the tests. When you finish you will have the ability to calculate each test correctly and confidently.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Be able to apply basic concepts to help you understand the bigger picture</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If basic concepts are explained poorly it can often seem that they have little relation to other components. I try my best to make sure you understand where these basic concepts apply.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Be able to break down each formula and explain its individual components</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how to plug numbers and use formulas is important, but as important is to be able to understand what we are measuring. I'll break down the individual components of formulas/equations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Contents and Overview </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course at its inception offers 2.5 hours or so of content but new content will be added over time. Chi-square and effect size for ANOVA will be added for sure. The 2.5 hours is sort of deceptive as I've tried to pack each second with something relevant and something important. I've made the course in a way to not waste your time and almost everything that is said in the lectures/lessons has a purpose. For example, I don't waste time reading example scenarios as you can do that for yourself by pausing the video.<br></p>",
