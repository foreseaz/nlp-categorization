    "description": "<p>Human beings are the most evolved creatures on earth and if you will probe into the human body you will find that Human body is brilliantly structured and there is a great deal of polymorphism and division of labor inside the human body. The systems of the human body work in synchronization with one another to keep us alive. Students often find it very difficult to understand how cells, tissues, organ and organ systems are correlated to one another. This course makes it easy for the students to understand what cells, tissues, organ and organ systems are exactly and how they cannot exist without one another.</p>",
