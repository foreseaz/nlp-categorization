    "description": "<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What is this course about? </strong></p>\n\n<p>This course is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><u>THE</u></strong> ultimate course on Physical Geology out there. Physical Geology is the study of the materials of the Earth, the different Geological process that operate beneath and on the surface, and the history and development of our planet. Physical geology is a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">MUST 101 prerequisite</strong> for students majoring in <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Geology</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Geophysics</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Paleontology,</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Petroleum Engineering</strong>, or <strong><u>ANYONE</u></strong> interested in exploring Earth. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course contains over 15 sections and 79 lectures, exploring all aspects of Physical Geology. The sections are: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li><p>Introduction </p></li><li><p>Solar System </p></li><li><p>Geological Time </p></li><li><p>Inside Earth</p></li><li><p>Plate Tectonics </p></li><li><p>Weathering </p></li><li><p>Deserts &amp; Winds </p></li><li><p>Minerals </p></li><li><p>Sedimentary Rocks </p></li><li><p>Metamorphic Rocks </p></li><li><p>Igneous Rocks </p></li><li><p>Deformation </p></li><li><p>Volcanos </p></li><li><p>Mass Wasting </p></li><li><p>Surface Water</p></li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How is the course structured?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The structure of the course is funnel shaped. It starts with the formation of the solar system, and the different bodies in it. Then it moves to explore Earth’s structure, materials, and the different forces that act in and outside. Each section is concerned with exploring one particular aspect of Physical Geology, in several lectures. The lectures are packed with information, delivered through beautiful, and clear videos, making the learning process fun and exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">BIG</strong> believer in visual learning and I have made sure to pack the lectures with pictures that explain the concepts. Even if you don’t have the luxury to go outside and see an anticline for example, you still have the chance to see a picture and recognize it when you see it in real life. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How do I learn better?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are quizzes after each section so you can test your knowledge and see how much of the material you have learned. I suggest you go through each lesson several times to better understand the contents, and be able to connect it with the rest of the materials in the course. </p>",
