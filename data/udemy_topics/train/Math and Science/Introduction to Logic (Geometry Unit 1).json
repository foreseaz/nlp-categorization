    "description": "<p style=\"\">This unit is the first in a High School Geometry curriculum.  It teaches basic logical concepts so that they can be applied to geometric concepts later on.  It can be taken by traditional high school students as well as High School Equivalency (HSE) students who are learning about geometric topics for their equivalency exams (GED, TASC, and/or HiSET).Topics include:</p><p style=\"\">(1) Conjectures and Counterexamples </p><p style=\"\">(2) Symbolic Logic</p><p style=\"\">(3) Truth Tables</p><p style=\"\">(4) Conditional Statements</p><p style=\"\">(5) Related Conditional Statements</p><p style=\"\">(6) Deductive Reasoning</p><p style=\"\">Each section has at least one related video, a video quiz, and a section quiz.  The video quiz is to be taken along with or shortly after watching the video.  The section quiz is to be taken after.  To supplement the course, you can use any textbook.  </p><p style=\"\">This course should take approximately five to ten hours to complete.</p>",
