    "description": "<p>This course is a part in a series of courses that covers a complete course in probability theory taught in the US colleges.</p>  <p>In this course you will learn continuous probability theory. You will learn how to predict the results of continuous random events and how to predict how much on average the actual results would deviate from your estimate. </p>  <p>If you are looking for an efficient way to learn/review probability theory, this course is for you. With dynamic slides, each hour of the series covers the material of more than a week of regular live lectures! </p>  <p>You may review lectures as many times as you want, skip easy exercises when the material is familiar, choose your own pace! If you need help, I will answer every question you post on the discussion board. If you are not completely satisfied, I offer a 30 day money back guarantee.</p>",
