    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Word problems are the least liked questions within any math course, but at the same time, they are the most useful to understand how to solve.  In this course, we will discuss a simple step-by-step approach you should follow for any word problem you face in a math course along with common strategies that can be used to solve a large variety of word problems.  While this approach is suitable for any math course you are taking, we will focus this course on introductory word problems you may come across in middle or high school level as well as 100-level college math courses.  They will be intermediate arithmetic and simple algebra used in our examples (i.e. 3x+7 = -5, solve for x).  I do not expect you to leave this course as an expert in solving word problems, but I do hope you will know how to set up a plan to solve each question you face.  The only way you can become an expert in solving word problems is through repeated practice and spotting the signs to determine which techniques will best help you solve each word problem, which is what we plan to teach you to do in this course.  </p>",
