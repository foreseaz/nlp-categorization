Each teaching lecture is followed by a short quiz that you can use to check your understanding.  I’ve also included practice questions you can download and I show how to work through them in video lectures. You’ll see how to approach the questions and gain full marks when doing them.</span>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color: rgb(17, 17, 17);\">Each lecture has clear objectives (using words like, <strong>name, describe, explain</strong>) to help you know what you are trying to learn. I’ve used ideas from Bloom’s Taxonomy, Solo Learning, Assessment for Learning and Visible Learning to develop these. At the end of each lecture you will see that content of the specification. This is really important as any exam question you will meet will have to be based on this.<br>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       The lectures are short but are crammed with information. Watch them as many times as you like and pause them when you need. You can easily watch them whilst you are waiting for a bus or train, or even during commercial breaks in your favourite TV programme! I’ve designed them so you can even use a smartphone or small tablet to view them.<br>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       Happy Learning!</span>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>",
