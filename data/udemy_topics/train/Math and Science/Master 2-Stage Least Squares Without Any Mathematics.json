This course is carefully designed for students/researchers who are learning 2SLS for the first time and who are not quantitatively inclined. <br><br>In fact, this course is entirely <u><strong>NON-MATHEMATICAL</strong>!</u> <br><br>This course is perfect for learning the<strong><em> intuition</em></strong> and <em><strong>logic</strong></em> of 2SLS and its corresponding diagnostic tests before formally learning the derivation and mathematics from an econometrics course or textbook. </p><p>Moreover, this course covers the application of 2SLS and its diagnostic tests using two of the most popular econometrics software packages, Stata and EViews. <br><br>At the end of this course, the student will have a clear understanding of why 2SLS is used and how it is implemented, and be able to estimate a 2SLS model using empirical data. <br><br></p>",
