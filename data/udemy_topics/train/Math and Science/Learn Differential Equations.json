    "description": "<p>This course will make\nyou able to override one of the prime subjects in Mathematics called\nDifferentiation. After successful accomplishment of this particular course, you\nwill have a deep grip on differential equations. The way of teaching comprises of basic definitions, theoretical\nexplanation and complete solutions of numerical problems. Each topic carries plenty of examples with all the relevant steps/sub\nsteps to make sure there’s no room for ambiguity. Since it was planned to\nprovide complete pdf of this course, therefore all the numerical examples have typed in\nMicrosoft word.  All the hard points have been revealed explicitly\nby doing extra calculations aside.  </p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This whole course has been compiled in the attached downloadable pdf files. Check a sample in preview (Section 11 - Lecture 52)<br></p><p>\n\nContent of the course\nis</p><ol><li>Bernoulli Equations</li><li>Homogeneous and Non Homogeneous Equations</li><li>Lagrange’s Mean Value Theorem</li><li>Linear Differential Equations</li><li>Maxima and Manima</li><li>Partial Differentiation</li><li>Polynomial Differential Equations</li><li>Separable Differential Equations</li><li>Total or Exact Differential Equations</li></ol>",
