    "description": "<p><strong></strong><strong>Level up math</strong> was created with the intention to increase your child's current state testing scale score from one level to the next. In many cases students would jump two levels. <strong>Level up math</strong> is not only a program designed to enhance vocabulary, it also has very memorable strategies on breaking down word problems and building confidence to evaluate every problem you should encounter from 5th grade to 8th grade with a push of a button. This program was designed not as a replacement for teaching but as a supplement for teaching. <strong>Level up Math</strong> was created initially because students were not retaining any relevant information in class because they were not trained on correct note taking skills, introduced to vocabulary placed on exams and most importantly their parents were not fully equipped to assist them for multiple reasons: Too many work hours, un educated, not familiar with today's teaching and/or didn't have the resources to fill in the gap that the child possessed. <strong>Level up math</strong> is the answer. This is not only a resource for our students, this is a resource for everyone. Adults have used <strong>LEVEL UP MATH</strong> for practice for placement exams, and other states tests mandated for certain positions.<strong></strong></p>",
