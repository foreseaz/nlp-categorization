The course presents the information in multiple ways to help reach all learning styles. </p><p>The information on quantum numbers will be presented through the following ways:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Visual/tangible hands on ways to visualize the quantum numbers</li><li style=\"\">Quantum numbers explained through the use of data tables and organizational charts</li><li style=\"\">A spatial explanation for those that are spatial or picture oriented</li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Through the use of effective analogies to help connect the known to the unknown </li></ul><p style=\"\">This course is mainly comprised of the video lessons and some practice problems to evaluate your understanding.  This course will take about an hour to complete.  </p><p>Quantum numbers are a complex topic in high school chemistry classes, but they are also the building blocks of large portions of other chemistry topics.  A good foundation of understanding quantum numbers will lead to greater success in future topics.<br style=\"\"></p>",
