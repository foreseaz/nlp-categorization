    "description": "<p>The current course takes you through 19 sample questions along with step-by-step solution for each question. The topics covered in this course are focused on integration techniques; mainly u-substitution and integration by parts. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to figure out when to use u-substitution and when to use integration by parts. You also will be able to make good guesses for ‘u’ in u-substitution technique. You then will learn how to select ‘u’ and ‘dv’ in integration by parts according to the type of functions being as integrand such as polynomials or logarithms, trigs, or exponential functions.  This course also contains a few delicate trigonometric integrals that require double-angle trig identities and will brush up your knowledge on trig functions.</p>",
