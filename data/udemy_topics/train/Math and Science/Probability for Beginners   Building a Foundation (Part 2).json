    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course is for beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of probability.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course begins with some basic laws of probability, and moves on to introduce the addition laws or theorems on probability.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    These videos are designed to give a clear understanding of the proofs for addition laws or theorems on probability. Building on probability concepts that begin in the middle grades, <em>students of <strong>K-11 and K-12 grades</strong> </em>use the language of set theory to expand their ability to extend the concept of addition theorems to problem solving.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The lectures also cover some results on probability of occurrence of a complementary event.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Also a brief discussion on odds of an event followed by a theorem on the same is covered in two of the videos. Appropriate examples are also discussed.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    These videos <strong><em>will remove the doubts</em></strong> and <strong><em>clear the confusion</em></strong> between the terms <strong><em>\"probability\" </em></strong>of an event happening and<strong><em> \"the odds\"</em></strong> of an event.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The videos <strong><em>can be completed in an hour.</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><em>Five interactive quizzes</em></strong> are added to the course. The quizzes are of two types.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Type one is  <strong><em>multiple choice</em></strong> quiz where only one of the answers provided is correct.  and  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Type two is <em><strong>true or false</strong></em> quiz. The problems in these quizzes should give you an idea about the type of problems that you can encounter in your exams.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    All questions are not direct. The solutions to some of them can be obtained by using more than one law or theorem.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    There is <strong><em>no time limit </em></strong>for the quiz. You can take the quiz at your own pace. However, it is advisable that a time limit be set in order to judge your speed of completing the quiz. This will help you in the preparation for actual examination. There is a <strong><em>score keeper </em></strong> for the quiz to track your progress  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Get started and <strong><em>gain confidence</em></strong> to state and establish the addition theorems on probability and use them in solving problems by enrolling into this course!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><em>Good Luck!</em></strong>  </p>",
