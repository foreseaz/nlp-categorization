    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    Limits are the core tool that we build upon for calculus. Many times, a function can be undefined at a point, but we can think about what the function &quot;approaches&quot; as it gets closer and closer to that point (this is the &quot;limit&quot;). Other times, the function may be defined at a point, but it may approach a different limit. There are many, many times where the function value is the same as the limit at a point. Either way, this is a powerful tool as we start thinking about slope of a tangent line to a curve. If you have a decent background in algebra (graphing and functions in particular), you&#039;ll hopefully enjoy this course!!!  </p>",
