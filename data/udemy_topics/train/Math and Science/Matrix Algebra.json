    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     This course would help in developing understanding on Matrix Algebra. It starts with a lecture on Introduction to matrices to build(brush) up fundamentals and then progresses towards discussing intermediate levels topics including  Algebra of matrix, Transpose and Determinants of a matrix, Adjoint and Inverse of matrix.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Throughout the course, <em style=\"\">emphasis is on learning Matrix Algebra using practice problems. </em>Practical applications of theoretical concepts is of paramount importance too. There is a section dedicated in applying Matrix Algebra constructs for <em style=\"\">solving system of linear equations.</em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Curriculum for the course is organized into five different sections containing 12 video lectures and around 3 hours of content. Every section is coupled with sample solved examples and practice problems in the form of a Quiz.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This course is continuously monitored and I shall be more than happy in assisting students on Matrix Algebra queries.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Last but certainly not the least - Feedback is much appreciated!!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">&quot;Happy Learning&quot; !!</strong>  </p>",
