    "description": "<p>This course is one of several courses designed for Algebra Based AP Physics 1. In this course we will cover the topic of Dynamics, which includes Newton's Laws, Linear Forces, Centripetal Forces, and Gravitation.  </p><p>The videos and resources will include lectures, demonstrations, and plenty of worked out example problems with High School physics curriculum and the AP Physics 1 curriculum in mind. This is perfect for any student planning to take the AP exam or any Introductory College physics student. While this course does not cover calculus based physics, any student enrolled in such course will still benefit from the ground work laid out here.</p><p>While this course does have sections for both High School and AP Level Physics, the videos intended for the AP crowed will be clearly labeled.</p><p>Upon completion of this course students should look to complete my other courses regarding the other content areas in AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2.</p>",
