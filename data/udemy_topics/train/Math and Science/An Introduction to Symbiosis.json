    "description": "<p>  \tThis course provides a brief introduction to the phenomenon of symbiosis, multiple organisms living together in an intimate relationship. Symbiosis can include symbiotic organisms, like lichens, to complex ecological interactions, as in microbial mat communities, to the extraordinarily diverse associations between individuals and various microbial communities, as in the intestine, skin and genitals. Symbiosis also opens the door to radically new ways to think about life and its evolution.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course is divided into six short lectures: Introduction to symbiosis; The lichen symbiosis; Physiology of symbiosis; Dynamics of symbiosis; The evolution of mutualism; and Symbiogenesis. It will take you about 90 minutes to watch them all. Please take a look at the promo video for a fuller description.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is aimed at anyone who has an interest in this phenomenon, from people with little biological training, to undergraduate college students who want an entry point into this fascinating subject, to professionals and graduate students looking for a quick brush-up on the subject.  </p>  <p>  \tWhen youâ€™ve completed the course, my goal is for you to have learned something about symbiosis, and that you will want to go out and learn more!  </p>",
