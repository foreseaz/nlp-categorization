    "description": "<p>Calculus one is the introductory course of Calculus as it covers all the essentials; From knowing what a function is to finding limits, taking derivatives, and sketching a given curve. This course is vital for any student wishing to pursue a degree in Science or Engineering. </p><p>For each topic that is covered in this course, I will start by giving a general introduction of concepts then I will move on to solve actual problems, because practice is definitely the best way to learn. I will conclude the course by introducing you to MATLAB which is a powerful tool, that allows you to graph curves, take derivatives and much more using few lines of code.</p><p>This course will be constantly updated and new material will be posted every now and then. And if you seek help I will be more than happy to answer your questions on the course page. </p>",
