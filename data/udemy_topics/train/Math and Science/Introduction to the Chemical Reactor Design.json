It conveniently summarizes the introduction to the chemical reactor design with its user friendly, colorful and concise approach.</p><p>I designed this course mainly for students at undergraduate levels of chemical engineering. There are many equations  necessary to be understood in this course. Write them down many times and you are well on your way to <strong style=\"\">design</strong> and specify <strong style=\"\">chemical reactors</strong> confidently.</p>",
