Measurement.<br>5. Data Handling.</p><p>The course has been broken into 5 modules to i) allow students to only enroll in what sections they are struggling with, ii) save the parent or student cost as each module is the price of a tutoring lesson and lastly, iii) to encourage students to break goals into bite-sized chunks.
