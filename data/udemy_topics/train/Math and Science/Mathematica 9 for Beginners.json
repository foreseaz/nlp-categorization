Advanced high school students, or students whose high school teaches Mathematica will also find this course invaluable.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            It assumes no understanding of programming languages, although knowledge, even rudimentary, of C/C++/Java is a plus.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            This course does NOT teach Mathematica as a programming language.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            This course does NOT teach Mathematics in general. Although a textbook on Pure Mathematics will come in handy for reference.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Any high school textbook that teaches college level Pure Mathematics is recommended. College students may use their course textbooks recommended by their Professor.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          Students are expected to:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          1. Know basic arithmetic and algebra including basic transcendental functions (exponential and trigonometric)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          2.
