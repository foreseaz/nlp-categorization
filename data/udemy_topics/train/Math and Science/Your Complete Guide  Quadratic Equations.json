    "description": "<p>  \tIn this course you will discover how to solve quadratic functions and equations using algebraic processes.  We will begin by applying the square root method and then move into solving by factoring, completing the square, and quadratic formula.  These processes will become very important to understand how to determine solutions of a quadratic as well as reason real world applications.  The course will start with identifying essential questions that will provide a theme of what you are expected to learn throughout the course.  We will then discover the essential definitions and processes that will be necessary to complete this course.  </p>  <p>  \tYou will then have the opportunity to try on your own over 100 example problems for each process so that you can master the skills set out in this course.  If at anytime you want to check your answer or get stuck.  Each problem is accompianed with a step by step tutorial video to help you along.  </p>  <p>  \tAfter you have completed the work you can answer the essential questions at the end of this course or work on the challenge problems to round off your learning and prepare you for the next level.  </p>",
