    "description": "<p>The <strong>Power 9 ISEE Math Middle Level</strong> course is a one stop shop to thoroughly prep for the math portion of the Middle Level ISEE. I have spent the last three years preparing students for the middle level ISEE exam, and have seen students make it into the most prestigious private schools in the country, including Harvard Westlake and Brentwood located in Los Angeles, California.  After reviewing and categorizing all of the practice ISEE problems I could find, I developed extensive analytics that have allowed me to create a specially tailored crash course to educate my students in every single aspect of the ISEE quantitative reasoning and math achievement sections.</p>\n\n<p>What separates this course from all the other courses out there is that it is \"frequency based.\" What does this mean? It means that you can pick and choose topics based on how often they will likely appear on the real exam. Here's what is included:</p>\n\n<ul><li>All necessary rules and operations condensed into severak videos of \"Critical Concept\" lectures</li><li>Easy-to-follow explanations of rules and functions</li><li>Essential mnemonic devices to quickly learn and retain material</li></ul>\n\n<p>Enroll today to ensure your optimal ISEE Middle Level math score!</p>",
