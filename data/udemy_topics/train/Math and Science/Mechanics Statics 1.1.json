We would also like to show you how to apply this knowledge with the help of real life examples that were inspired by many years of experience in the field.  </p>  <p>  \t        You will see how this knowledge can be used to solve complex problems, providing you with positive experiences.  </p>  <p>  \t        The knowledge gained in this theoretical video can be further practiced and better understood by completing the closely related exercises presented in the video: Mechanics Statics Exercises 1.1.  </p>  <p>  \t        We recommend this video to anyone studying statics in school, anyone who would like to review their knowledge in this area, as well as those interested in engineering, who have not yet had a chance to study it.  </p>",
