The great thing about place value is once you understand 1s - 100&#039;s you can follow the concepts into 1,000&#039;s and up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      This course also explains Regrouping or what we used to call &quot;carry the one&quot;. This concept will be explained and you&#039;ll never have to memorize the phrase &quot;carry the one&quot; again because you will understand why regrouping is necessary and will make the adjustments without having to memorize.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      The hope of this course is that you leave it:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      Math confident!!!!\r\n</p>",
