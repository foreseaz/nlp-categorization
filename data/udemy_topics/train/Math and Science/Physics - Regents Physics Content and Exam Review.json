    "description": "<p>This course is one of several courses designed for Regents Physics. In this course we will cover the entire Regents Physics Curriculum in a review format.  The videos and resources will include lectures, demonstrations, and plenty of worked out example problems specific for the Regents Physics curriculum. </p><p>This course is perfect for any high school physics student, especially those in NY State.  The format is simple, I review a topic and then have one or two videos going over example problems specific for that topic.  The last batch of lectures are me going over the entirety of two different Regents exams.  </p><p>I suggest you complete this course along side other physics courses or in addition to your classroom course.  This is a review so I will be going faster than I would normally if this were not review.  you may want to consider taking my other courses in addition to this course if you are looking for a more throrough and detailed lecture for each topic.  </p>",
