    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this course, you will solve all sorts of general annuity problems.  A general annuity is an annuity where the <strong style=\"\">payments do not coincide with the interest periods</strong>.  You will be able to see that it is very easy to deal with general annuities once an equivalent interest rate is determined with that equivalent rate being compounded as often as the payments are made.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      With this course, you will be able to download a complete set of notes which can be used when viewing the video lectures and examples.  The course will take you 3-4 days to complete although this time may vary among different students.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Any student who is taking a business program or a mathematics of finance course will be interested in this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     It would be beneficial to have a thorough understanding of Ordinary Simple Annuities prior to registering for this course.
