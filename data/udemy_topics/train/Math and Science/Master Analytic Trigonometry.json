    "description": "<p>  \tThis course will take you from simplifying basic trigonometric expressions to solving complex trigonometric equations.  We will sprinkle in verifying trigonometric identities in there as well.  This course starts with an introductory video for each topic and then provides over 76 examples on how to solve different examples.  If you need help finding the right answer each example has a step by step tutorial showing you what to do.  There is also hints and processes used in the description to give you a better idea.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course should take you a couple of days to complete while you work through the problems and use the videos as reinforcement.  This course is created to be your complete guide for Analytic Trigonometry.  </p>",
