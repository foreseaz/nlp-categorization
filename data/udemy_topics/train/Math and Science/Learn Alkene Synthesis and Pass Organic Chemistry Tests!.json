You will learn how to execute alkene (double bond) problems with ease and confidence. What you will get from this course: </p><p>- Improved grades in your class </p><p>- Lifetime access to tutorial videos on all alkene subjects including: naming, stability, stereochemistry, and all mechanisms and synthesis techniques learned in Organic Chemistry I. </p><p>- The ability to ask your own organic chemistry questions to the instructor with personalized feedback. I am an experienced university teacher and you can search for me on rate my professor using the name: Matthew Tomney.</p><p>- Video walk-through of solved problem sessions for your own practice and review.  </p>",
