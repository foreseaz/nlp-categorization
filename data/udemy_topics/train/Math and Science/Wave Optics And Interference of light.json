It will be revolving majorly around the concept of <br style=\"\">  \tInterference and Diffraction<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \tYou ll see what they are, and how amazing they are, and how they play a role in our everyday lives (yes literally LITERALLY EVERYDAY). You ll understand (and not just FYI, but full quantitative analysis) why<br style=\"\">  \tSoap bubbles are colored, why some insects give out very bright colors (also feathers of peacock), why when you look at far away things, they blur (or pixelation if you prefer digitial :P) and a lot more other stuff. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tIf you are a high school student taking up a physics course or going to take up, anything at AP level or below, this is recommended for you<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tThe structure of the course is pretty standard, Everything is in videos. There are two modes.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tThe float head -&gt; where you will see my head talking about concepts with animations  </p>  <p>  \tThe hands --&gt; where you will see.. well my beautiful hands with which I write stuff like equations<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tI look forward to seeing you.
