    "description": "<p style=\"\">A lot of professors give us practice exams or homework and sometimes they never solves them! I know the struggle of solving them and trying to understand the concept behind it. So I made this course to give other fellow students more problems to test themselves plus having the answer and how I solved it! </p><p style=\"\">The main focus of this course is to help you understand Physics 2 by solving problems step by step. </p><p style=\"\">Topics we will be solving some problems from are Electricity, Magnetism, DC circuit, AC circuit and Light and optics. Some example problems: Two Loop RL Circuit, Point Charges in two Dimensions and Power in AC circuit. </p><p style=\"\">I had all my videos on YouTube channel but I decided to move them here because I would have a better communication with the student and can post the full question to benefit more people than just the students who use SmartPhysics Homework base website.</p>",
