My target audience may not be  students only but also parents and teachers. The content is variable and has to do with methods and tools used in order to overcome any difficuties on understanding Physics. I use mainly Powerpoint slides, along with simulations, online tests, work sheets and many more. Everyone who will take this course will have the benefit of understanding the typical mistakes that guide to misconseptions and  difficulties when studying Physics. The course will be completed in less than a month.</em>  </p>",
