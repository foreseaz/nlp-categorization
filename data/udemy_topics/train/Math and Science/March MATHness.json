Not sure who to pick? Let math help you out!</p><p><br style=\"\"></p><p>In this course, you will learn <strong style=\"\">three popular rating methods</strong> two of which are also used by the Bowl Championship Series, the organization that determines which college football teams are invited to which bowl games.&nbsp;<span>The first method is simple winning percentage. &nbsp;The other two methods are the Colley Method and the Massey Method, each of which computes a ranking by solving a system of linear equations. We also learn how to adapt the methods to take late season momentum into account. This allows you to <strong style=\"\">create your very own mathematically-produced brackets for March Madness</strong> by writing your own code or using the software provided with this course.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br style=\"\"></p><p>From this course, you will learn math driven methods that have led Dr. Chartier and his students to place in the top 97% of 4.6 million brackets submitted to ESPN! &nbsp;See more:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.insidescience.org/content/math-improves-march-madness-predictions/531\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Math Improves March Madness Predictions</a>&nbsp;<br style=\"\"></p><p><a href=\"http://www.foxcharlotte.com/news/education/Bracketology-101-117989874.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Bracketology 101</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br style=\"\"></p><p></p>  ",
