The topics\ncovered in this course are focused on computing partial derivatives in order to\nfind critical points, maximum and minimum problems, and Lagrange multipliers. By the end of this\ntutorial, you will be able to give a definition of an absolute maximum and\nminimum of a function, compute partial derivatives, find critical points, find\nmaxima and minima in a constrained optimization problem, and use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the maxima and\nminima in optimization problems within a region in two variables. </p>",
