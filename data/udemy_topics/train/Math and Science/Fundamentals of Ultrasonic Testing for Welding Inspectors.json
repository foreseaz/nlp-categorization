He goes to the point and that's an important characteristic for me in the industrial knowlede. Thank you for give us this opportunity to learn about this topic. We waiting for UT level II with Mustapha.<em> Jesus Legarda</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Ultrasonic testing</strong> (<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">UT</strong>) is a family of non-destructive testing techniques based on the propagation ofultrasonic waves in the object or material tested. In most common UT applications, very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz, and occasionally up to 50 MHz, are transmitted into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials. A common example isultrasonic thickness measurement, which tests the thickness of the test object, for example, to monitor pipework corrosion.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The field of Nondestructive Testing (NDT) is a very broad, that plays a critical role in assuring that structural components and systems perform their function in a reliable and cost effective fashion. NDT technicians and engineers define and implement tests that locate and characterize material conditions and flaws that might otherwise cause serious accidents such as, planes to crash, reactors to fail, trains to derail, pipelines to burst, and a variety of troubling events.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>These tests are performed in a manner that does not affect the future usefulness of the object or material. In other words, NDT allows parts and materials to be inspected and evaluated without damaging them. Because it allows inspection without interfering with a product's final use, NDT provides an excellent balance between quality control and cost-effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why take this course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Level 1 ultrasonic course requires no prior training or experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Training material is presented in a manner that promotes understanding and the ability to make immediate application. This course is ideal for you in order to qualify for certification.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course provides you with Level 1 training in the fundamentals of Ultrasonic Testing methods. It will introduce you to the basic concepts and principles and includes hands-on training using Ultrasonic Testing equipment settings and functions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> The Ultrasonic theories presented will provide the knowledge of Ultrasonic Testing required and enable you to work with individuals qualified and certified to gain needed experience for qualification as Level 1. While the practicle manipulations will give you the essential steps that you will need to calibrate the ultrasonic testing equipment, perform the inspection, collect and interpret the data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What's Included?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course consists of two handbooks: The first handbook made by the instructor is the official of the training. It covers all the topics presented through the 39 lectures. While the second one (offered as bonus) is the official one of the TWI (International Institute of Welding) training.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, the course includes 39 lectures alternating between the different lecture types, with regular quizzes and exams to enable you to check that your are following the topics covered. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is available to start instantly online through Udemy – once you've chosen the course, you can get started straight away.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How Does it Work?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is broken down into chapters, that takes around 3 hours to complete. Each chapter is broken down into its major topics. This ensures that course content is broken down into bitesized educational units that are easy to digest.</p>",
