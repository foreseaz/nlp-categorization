    "description": "<p><u>Note: This is a live course and gets updated regularly. Last updated on February 2016 with a New lecture.</u><br></p><p>Mathematics is everywhere!! And the base of mathematics is fundamental operations like Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction. There are lot of people who have a math phobia or they just don't like mathematics, the root cause is not Mathematics rather the way they encountered it. I guarantee that after taking this course you will love mathematics and enjoy doing your small mathematical experiments.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course we will take a close and detail look at multiplication techniques offered by Vedic Mathematics and various math brain teasers with answers<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">.</strong> \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are preparing for GRE, GMAT, Bank PO, NTSE, MBA &amp; Engg or any other competitive exam and want a perfect score in quantitative aptitude (QA), then this course will surely help you.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why should YOU take this course?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>1.    The Vedic Mathematics techniques discussed in this course <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">will make calculation 15 to 20 times faster </strong>than conventional methods. You will surely love mathematics and can prepare cool math games for kids or math riddles for kids.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>2.    You will have lifetime access to 14+ video lectures and all your queries/doubts will get a detail answer, if required with an additional video tutorial also!!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>3.    At the end of this course, you will love mathematics, do multiplication within 10 seconds and love to experiment with formulas and mathematics.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Content and overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will start with overview of the course where I will explain \" <em>what is covered in this course?</em>\". Then each lecture will cover a  technique with lots of examples/demonstration and all the variations related to it. At the end of the section you will come to know how and why this multiplication technique work. This will allow you to do multiple experiment and create your own formula.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each lecture clearly describes the technique and its application as well as coupled with Quiz/Practice exercise. We have a revision lecture also. So, it's a complete workshop having learn-practice-revise model.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The duration of the complete course is around 1 hour and 45 minutes. Along with Quiz and Practice exercise it may take around 2 hours and 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is based on the famous Vedic Mathematics book by Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji Maharaja which is considered as the first book on Vedic Mathematics<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>========================================================================\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>What do students feel about the course?</em></strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em><em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Prashant Bansal says: </strong></em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>Extremely simple &amp; lightning speed</em></strong><ul><li><em>Those of u appearing for any competitive exams must take the course.
