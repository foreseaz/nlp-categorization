    "description": "This course contains video tutorials in classical mechanics at upper high school and  pre-university levels.   Each section of the course begins  with video tutorials in concepts, rules and formalism of relevant topics; then you can take a quiz and watch problem and solution lectures.   Each lecture has a supplementary material that is either the summary of the lecture with its important equations in pdf format, or it is the image of the lecture.  This is a live course; I will improve the course by modifying the lectures and adding more lectures on it especially problem solving lectures. Changes will also be based on student&#039;s feedbacks.  So if you subscribe to this course in addition to the lifetime access to the improving and growing number of lectures, you can also ask your questions, make comments on this course; and you can also send me any problem relevant to the course, after finding its solution I will add it to the problem and solution lectures.",
