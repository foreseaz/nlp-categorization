The notions of conditional probability and independence are at the heart of probability theory. <br></p><p>The course consists of </p><ul><li>theoretic lectures and lectures with motivations, and</li><li>practice lectures</li></ul><p>In general, practice lectures are marked as easy, intermediate and advanced.
