    "description": "<p>This unit is the first in a High School Algebra 2 curriculum. It teaches basic trigonometric concepts so that they can be applied to algebra 2 concepts later on. It can be taken by traditional high school students as well as High School Equivalency (HSE) students who are learning about geometric topics for their equivalency exams (GED, TASC, and/or HiSET).Topics include:</p><p>(1) Introduction to Trigonometry</p><p>(2) Special Right Triangles in Trigonometry</p><p>(3) The Other Three Trig Functions</p><p>(4) Solving Trig Problems</p><p>(5) Angles of Elevation and Depression</p><p>Each section has a related video, a video quiz, and a section quiz. The video quiz is to be taken along with or shortly after watching the video. The section quiz is to be taken after. To supplement the course, you can use any textbook.<br></p><p>This course should take approximately five to ten hours to complete.</p>",
