    "description": "<p>The current course is the first set of an 11-set sample assignment for integral calculus for first year math taught in north american universities. The integral calculus course will cover vectors, and surfaces, constraint optimization using Lagrange multipliers, integration, integration techniques, numerical integration, probability, and sequence and series. Each set will take about an hour to finish. It will help the first year university students to have a better grasp of the material and be able to tackle their homework questions on their own. The current course (first set) takes you through 14 sample questions along with step-by-step solution for each question. This course will cover the definition of scalar functions of several variables and their geometric representations, level curves, and vector algebra. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to perform arithmetic operations on vectors, identify the length and direction of vector, form plane equations, do vector algebra, and draw level curves. </p>",
