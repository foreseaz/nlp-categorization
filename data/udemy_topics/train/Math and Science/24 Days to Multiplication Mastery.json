    "description": "<p>24 Days to Multiplication Mastery is a fully comprehensive course for learning and internalizing single digit multiplication from 2 through 9.  It is not only effectively organized and specially tailored for multiple learning styles, but it is fun and colorful with a plethora of visual and auditory cues to keep you engaged from Day 1 to Day 24.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why I created thisÂ course is because I have recognized, after years of private tutoring, that multiplication mastery underpins everyone's ability to succeed in all math courses thereafter.  Once you nail down this component, your confidence will soar and math success will inevitably follow.</p>\n\n<p>The key with this course is to put in consistent practice every day.  Follow the curriculum exactly as it is laid out, and in 24 days, I promise that you will have a brand new skill in your back pocket!</p>",
