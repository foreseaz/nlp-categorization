    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tPhysical Metallurgy 2 covers the basics of metallic structure formation. It handles alloy formation and the basic solidification of alloys through the exploitation of a basic phase diagram. It then jumps to the iron/ iron-carbide/ graphite system and lays the foundation of an understanding of the metallurgy, processing and application of ferrous alloys.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tPhysical Metallurgy 2 lays the foundation for study of further physical metallurgical subjects, such as casting processes, steels and other industrial alloys, application of alloys, heat treatment, etc.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tFurther material is available, but not yet online. See www.simulasie.co.za fro details.  </p>",
