    "description": "<p>This course is a sequel to my course &quot;R, ggplot, and Simple Linear Regression&quot;.  Here we take on polynomial regression and learn how to fit polynomials to data sets.  Along the way, we will learn how to write our own functions in R and how to graph them with ggplot.  At the conclusion of the course, we will learn how to fit a smoothing spline to data sets.  </p><p>At a relaxed pace, it should take about a week to complete the course.  You will need to have R and RStudio installed, and it would be best if you have a background in R and ggplot equivalent to what you would get if you viewed my first course mentioned above.  </p>",
