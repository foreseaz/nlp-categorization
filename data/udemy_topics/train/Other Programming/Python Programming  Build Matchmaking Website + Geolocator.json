You will learn how to build your own website that matches people based off interests and questionnaires.  We'll implement a subscription model (SaaS) on this one.  </p>  <p>  \t      This is how billion dollar sites like Match and OkCupid were built...this one is adapting the same idea to a job site, it could be the start for your own recruiting empire.  </p>  <p>  \t      <strong>Create a Geolocator (It's Happy Hour Time)</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Build a web-based app to help find local restaurant happy hours for food/drinks. We will build a geo-locating service using Foursquare's API/Data and Google Maps.  </p>  <p>  \t      Hint: you could use the landing page created in step 1 ascertain interest in an app like that this to test whether or not this in itself could be a business.  </p>",
