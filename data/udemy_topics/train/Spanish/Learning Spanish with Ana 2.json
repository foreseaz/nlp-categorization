    "description": "<p>  \tAs a Spanish teacher, it&#039;s really important for me to teach my students useful concepts to help them with the second most spoken language in the world. You&#039;ll find the essential vocabulary to speak about daily topics such as the weather, our routine and free time, the parts of our house or our friend&#039;s descriptions. It&#039;s a practical course and you&#039;ll find it easy to follow it. You just have to relax, enjoy learning by watching these videos. Firts, we&#039;ll talk about some grammar considerations. Then we&#039;ll revise simple present, adding irregular verbs. And finally we will talk about common topics. You will find notes for each video and a final exam to check your progress.  </p>",
