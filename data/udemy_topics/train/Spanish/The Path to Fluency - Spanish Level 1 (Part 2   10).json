    "description": "<p>This course is designed for students who have already taken a beginner course, such as Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, Fluenz, or high school/college classes. Rather than give you random words and phrases to memorize, we structured our lessons to help you achieve the optimal amount of language retention.</p><p>Set in a series of stories, the lessons place you in everyday situations and daily activities of a family. Every story consists of ten lessons, each expanding on the previous while having a guide to clarify grammar and idioms as needed. The whole learning process focuses on the familyâ€™s casual conversations in their daily life which progressively becomes more and more complex. This learning experience flows very naturally and is meant to make you feel like you are a part of the story actively participating with the family, rather than simply studying words and phrases.</p>",
