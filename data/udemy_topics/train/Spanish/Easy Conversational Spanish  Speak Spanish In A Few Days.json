    "description": "<p>Have you ever taken a Spanish course, and then when you want to use the language in a really life situation with someone, you realised you couldn't say much more than hello?

We want you to feel good about your ability to learn languages! You will learn building blocks of Spanish that will allow to form hundreds of sentences. We will hold your hand throughout the whole process have you speaking Spanish immediately! <strong>Enrol </strong><strong>on this course and don’t miss out on this easy opportunity to easily learn </strong><strong>Spanish!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Other traditional language learning structures a based on boring, predictable teaching structures that work against the way your brain is truly supposed to learn. The method used in this course uses an approach totally different from all others. <strong>This approach will keep your brain engaged on the learning process</strong> and allow you to automatically learn language grammar rules without realising! You will learn the most important tenses in the Spanish language and will be <strong>freed</strong><strong> </strong>from the constraints of “complicated grammar”!</p><p>At <strong>LearnSpanish101</strong> we utilise your natural ability to absorb new information quickly by using different memory techniques such as our “memory links”. Advanced techniques such as <strong>Prof. C.A. Mace</strong>’s <em>'spaced repetition'</em> have also been applied so that you will not have to rote memorise any of the vocabulary introduced. This course also provides a native speaker of the Spanish language to benefit your listening skills. After personally using the techniques delivered to you by <strong>LearnSpanish101</strong>, the founder was able to learn six other languages which include German and Chinese. <strong>After completing this course you too will realise your power to learn languages!</strong></p>",
