In this course we are going to use 9 main verbs, with these verbs you will be able to express the things that you like to do, what you want, what you have to do, the things that you can do, and many more!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to read Spanish</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This section is optional.

These are very important, but most of the times we leave them apart.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of every section you will be able to do a test.
