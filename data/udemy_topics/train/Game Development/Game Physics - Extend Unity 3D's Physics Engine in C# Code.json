I expect you to have some experience with both Unity 3D, and C# before starting this course. If you don't then check out my Complete Unity Developer course.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t     Why would you take this course?  </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>  \t<li>To understand game physics better.</li>  \t<li>Practice creating your own physics components.</li>  \t<li>Improve your knowledge of Newtons Laws of Motion.</li>  </ol>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  There is a thriving community, and we will be providing our usual <strong>world-class support </strong>that our students have come to expect.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: access to this course comes with an optional, free community site where you can share games and 3D models, as well as connect with other students.<br></p>\n\n<p>  \t     See you in there!  </p>",
