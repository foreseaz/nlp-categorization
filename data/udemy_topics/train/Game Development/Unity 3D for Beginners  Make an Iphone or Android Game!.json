You will have a fully functional 2D game by the end of this course. This course's lessons are meant to be watched in order, and in my experience, it will be beneficial if you do the work <em>while </em>watching, and not after. Basic programming concepts will be covered, and all artwork used will be taught how to reciprocate by using a vector graphics drawing software named \"Inkscape\". However, take note that the final game you will develop (Shipped!) is copyrighted by Virality Inc. </p><p>Have Fun! :)</p>",
