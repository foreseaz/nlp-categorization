Use the arrow keys to move a character around and attack while traversing a vector based environment (you can easily draw the entire level to play on using vector shapes or movie clips.  </p>  <p>  \t Also included is alternate code to use with a mobile device&#039;s accelerometer (tested on the Android &amp; iPhone OS). Topics include:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Add new classes for different enemies.</li>  \t<li>Add new classes for objects like coins to collect.</li>  \t<li>Swap in new art to easily create new levels (just cut and paste, or draw in new art).</li>  \t<li>Add more levels, including animation that the player could collide with.</li>  \t<li>Add more objectives (items to pick up or areas on the board to go to)</li>  \t<li>Adjust how many enemies are on stage, where they spawn from, and how often they appear.</li>  \t<li>Change the physics of the game, speed or attack intensities of the enemies</li>  </ul>  <p>  \tAs usual with Justin&#039;s tutorials, source files are included.  </p>",
