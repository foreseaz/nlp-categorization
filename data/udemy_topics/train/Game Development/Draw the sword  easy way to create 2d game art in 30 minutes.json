In this short video course You will get the very first basics of drawing vector graphics on computer - for RPG, for arcade or adventure, for anything else.  </p>  <p>  \tJust because You can and now You have the correct tool.  </p>  <p>  \tFew months ago I have no idea how to start. All my painting skills - from school lessons and was very primitive. But I want to start make my own graphics for my own games. I just want to start make something better than yesterday.  </p>  <p>  \tYou can do the same and - with my help - get it easier and faster.  </p>  <p>  \tLittle bit more than 30 minutes and You will draw Your very first blades and swords^ short sword and double bladed sword (or knife). Just follow the instruction from the video, make the right moves - and it will be done.  </p>  <p>  \tThere no need in special skills. You don&#039;t need to have any skills or professional software. Just willing and little bit patience. Video builded for very beginners and I speak slowly, than anybode understand what to do.  </p>  <p>  \tHope You will like this course and in next our You will be proud owner of Your first 2d game art created by Your hands.  </p>  <p>  \tGood luck!
