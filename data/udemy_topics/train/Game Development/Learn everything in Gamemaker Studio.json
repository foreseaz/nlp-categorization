Instead of making a platformer or making a clone of a game, we're going to break down <strong><em>EVERYTHING </em></strong>you need to know in Gamemaker: Studio.</p><p><br></p><p>As I learned how to make games through trial and error, you can take this course in addition to watching someone else making a game in GM:S, so you can fully understand everything.</p><p><br></p><p>This course is for absolute beginners, and is a good guide to understanding rather than doing.</p><p>This course is absolutely <strong>free</strong>, so please take it and hit the green button on the right.</p>",
