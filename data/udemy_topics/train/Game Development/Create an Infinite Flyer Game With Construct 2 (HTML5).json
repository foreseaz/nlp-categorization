    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Based on some of the reviews, I&#039;m going to classify this course as an Intermediate course now.  I strongly suggest going through my Platformer Course before doing this course. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">1. Making the background move.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We start off by making the background appear to move for infinity.  This is the corner stone of any infinite runner or flyer type of game.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">2. We all need a hero!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We create our hero, add his animations and make him to fly (and fall) using Touch controls.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">3. Timer, Coins and Bugs, Oh my!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We create a timer to keep track of how long our player lasts, we add in some coins to collect and a bug that is used for a power up.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">4. My first FUNCTION()</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t Functions are an important part of any programming language, even in Construct 2, where you donâ€™t program at all.  Or do you???  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">5. Birds, Electric Eels, and more functions.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We have to have some bad guys to make the game interesting.  Oh, and I throw in some more function.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">6. Have I mentioned how awesome functions are?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t Oh yeah, more functions.  They are so darn useful and easy to use.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">7. Clean up and increasing difficulty over time.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We clean up the game a bit and add the element of difficulty.  In this game, the game will get increasingly harder the long the player lives.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Bonus Video 1</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t I will show an alternate way to make your player fly/fall  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Bonus Video 2</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t We will create a Title Screen  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Bonus Video 3</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t This video will walk through the steps of creating a Top 10 High Score table using local storage.  </p>  <p class=\"PIN_1373221198925_hazClick\">  </p>",
