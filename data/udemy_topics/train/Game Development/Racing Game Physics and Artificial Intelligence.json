    "description": "<p>This course discusses the key technical ideas that form the foundation of modern commercial racing games. The emphasis is on the driving game physics and the artificial intelligence techniques that are used.  It's a fantastic course for video game developers working on racing game titles. It's also a perfect fit for gamers and enthusiasts interested in understanding how racing games and related simulations really work. Although the included sample games were built with Unity, the coverage in this course will not require any particular knowledge of the software. Follow-on training is available for students who wish to take their knowledge even further and actually build a racing game of their own!  </p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The playable build and project source is no longer offered with the free version of this course. Please visit The Game Institute's main website and become a member to get the files. </p>",
