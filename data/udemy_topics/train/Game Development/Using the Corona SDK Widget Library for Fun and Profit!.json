And while most of the videos show use in a business-type app, they're created the exact same way in a game.</p><p>Corona SDK is the best framework I've found for quickly creating 2D mobile games. With the creation of their widget library a while back it became possible to create business-type apps as well.</p><p>I've chosen to use Corona for <em>both</em> games and business apps because every bit of skill I gain with one will help me out immediately in the other.</p><p><em>(Promo picture courtesy Joseph Morris via flickr CC2.0)</em></p>",
