Animator Mark Bremmer shows how to develop and animate characters and scenes in Poser, and most importantly, how to import them into Unity 3D. This course is designed for users that already have experience with PoserPro 2014 and Unity. You will start by learning about basic character preparation, then jump into learning about advanced character clothing, including morphing clothing types, adjusting clothing with the fitting room, and hair selection and clothing magnets. From there, Mark will teach you about animation sets for motion, such as walking and running cycles, animating morphs, and importing and exporting animation sets.</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis video tutorial also covers static morphs, adding and working with props, and working with imported FBX content. Finally, you will learn how to rig custom characters. Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of creating and animating your own characters and scenes. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.  </p>",
