If you’re completely new to programming or just need a little refresher, this is a great starter tutorial series, and it is all completely free.  </p>  <p>  \t    In the<strong style=\"\"> Swift and Sprite Kit </strong>section, you can follow right along with me during my first week with Sprite Kit and Swift. Although, I’m quite comfortable behind the wheel with Sprite Kit, these videos were recorded over my first 5 days with Swift, so this series is a bit more off-the-cuff, experimental, and reveals some of my initial “ah-ha” moments with the language.  </p>",
