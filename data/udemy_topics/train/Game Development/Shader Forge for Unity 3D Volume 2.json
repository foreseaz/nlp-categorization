In this course we dive deeper into the knowledge of the different nodes, available in Shader Forge, and gives you a better understanding of just how some more advanced shader techniques are accomplished.</p><p>Throughout this course we will learn how to do effects such as Refraction, the ins and outs of uv&#039;s, and how to create FX such as a peel away dissolve, seen in many of todays games. By the end of this course you will have created a Glass shader, a Matcap shader, and a translucency shader as well as learned some tips and tricks of shader construction.</p>",
