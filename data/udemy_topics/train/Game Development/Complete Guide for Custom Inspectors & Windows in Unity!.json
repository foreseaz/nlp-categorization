Your job is to make their job easier, and this can be a good start point!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course expects some proficiency in programming, so you should be comfortable with C# for Unity before you get started.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This unique content will get you through the whole process of creating nice looking custom inspectors for your scripts, windows and custom properties, but it will also cover quick ways to change the appearance of a script's inspector by using variable and method attributes.</p>",
