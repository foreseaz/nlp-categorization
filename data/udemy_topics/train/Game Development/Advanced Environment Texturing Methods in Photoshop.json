I&#039;ll start by explaining all the techniques individually, then move on to showing how I use all the techniques to take a texture from start to finish.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Best results are achieved using a pressure-sensitive tablet. Many techniques shown here don&#039;t require the latest version of Photoshop.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course won&#039;t take hours to complete and you&#039;ll see results immediately. I&#039;m confident the methods I use aren&#039;t found anywhere else online, so I&#039;m certain you&#039;ll learn something new!  </p>  <p>  \tThe series is a work in progress, so expect new videos over time.  </p>",
