Kids can use their finger to paint on touch screen. They can choose a color from the colors palette to start coloring and paint. In addition, you can erase (with white). Coloring activities can contribute to the development of kids creativity and character by helping the functions of both the left and right brain work. Creativity takes its power from the right brain and can appear in the form of thoughts, things or anything. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Features :</strong><br style=\"\">  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Support customization for other sprites </li>  \t<li> All features arranged on a single screen, no confusing navigation </li>  \t<li> Supports PC, iOS and Android </li>  \t<li>C# Commented Code</li>  \t<li> Custom Images </li>  \t<li> Complete Scene </li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Unity is on the top of the develop-once distribute-many platforms and it is really an awesome one-stop-shop platform and game engine for games, that is why we choose it as development platform.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Please note:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">In this course we use an existing project as the basis to develop the topics on how to create 2D Painting game, in our experience this is a great way to learn Unity with practical projects.
