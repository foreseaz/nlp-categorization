    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  For years game development was considered one of the most complex tasks a developer could tackle.  What seemed the most trivial of games required months of work-- and years of programming experience.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Now, imagine being able to develop and publish your own games.  Imagine that game for sale on all of these platforms:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>iOS/Apple App Store</li>  \t<li>Android/ Google Play Store</li>  \t<li>Amazon/ Amazon AppStore for Android</li>  \t<li>Facebook </li>  \t<li>Wii U </li>  \t<li>More...</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Once you master Construct 2 you&#039;ll be able to develop exciting, sophisticated games in a nearly code-free environment.  Those games will be able to be distributed across the wide network of online app stores and game libraries.  And these are not just your average games...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  With Construct 2 and the what you learn in this course you&#039;ll be able to create 2d games such as platformers, jumpers, wave-based games and much more.  You can include advanced features such as in-app purchases and multi-player options.  You can even borrow game assets included with the platform to get you started.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  With Reece Siksay as your instructor, and LearnToProgram&#039;s new course <strong style=\"\">Construct 2 for Beginners</strong>, you&#039;ll be making entertaining games very quickly.  </p>",
