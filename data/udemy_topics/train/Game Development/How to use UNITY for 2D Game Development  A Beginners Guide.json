This course isn't going to make you a game but it is going to give you a JUMPSTART on how to make a game with the complicated Unity engine. If you haven't made a game before this is the course for you. If you have made a game before (with Unity) this may be a bit basic for you. By the end of this course you will be familiar with Unity and the 2D tools.</p><p style=\"\">=======================</p><p style=\"\">What material is included?</p><p style=\"\">======================</p><p style=\"\">The material that is included is all found within the Unity Asset store. When you import the platformer example project all of the art is imported with it.
