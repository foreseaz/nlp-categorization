    "description": "<p>In this series, we'll look at creating a high-resolution camera for insertion into a full-page advertisement. We'll be creating the camera using a variety of methods to model each piece of the equipment. We want the camera to have enough resolution and details that when it's lit within Keyshot (once we drop the camera into our scene), every detail will stand out perfectly for our full-page ad. We'll then take the final renders and drop them into Photoshop to composite them into the full-page ad and add any final special effects.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p>More about the Instructor:</p><p>Stephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.
