    "description": "<p><em></em>This course covers how the VFX process works from starting with an idea for a project, taking it into concept and then going through the process to get to the final. Follow me as I build this shot going through all the different stages. </p><p>We will focus on the overall picture on what each stage implies and will not get into the technical aspect of the softwares but rather learn what we do in each stage and how we go from one step to another for example: how we start with a storyboard, previs it, move into shooting our footage and so on.</p><p>I will be creating a separate course that will focus on learning on how to composite this shot in Nuke as this course will cover the overall VFX Process, so when you are planning your shot / project / film, you will know what to consider and how to plan and execute it better. </p><p>You will be able to get much better results if you follow this process and focus how each step plays an important role to make the end result look great!<br><br>More lectures will be added to this course.</p>",
