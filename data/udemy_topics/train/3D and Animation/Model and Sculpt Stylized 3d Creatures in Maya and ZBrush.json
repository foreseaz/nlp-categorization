    "description": "<p>In this intermediate level tutorial we will be focusing on the process of creating a creature that could be used in the Games Industry. Starting from a simple concept, we will create a base mesh for our creature, move into sculpting, and finish with Retopology and UV layout. The tutorial focuses heavily on sculpting fundamentals in ZBrush, as well as the necessary tools to create a game resolution mesh using Maya. By the end of the module you will have a game resolution character ready for the texturing process.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>An adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom.
