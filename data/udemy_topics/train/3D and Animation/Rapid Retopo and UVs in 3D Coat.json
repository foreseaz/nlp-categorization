    "description": "<p>The course is the process of unwrapping a robot model which I did in another Udemy course - Hard Surface Modeling and Sculpting Course in 3D Coat.  It covers everything you need to know to get useful geometry and UVs from voxels.</p><p>Its a big job and I discover some surprises on the way, like not having enough graphics card  memory and how to resolve the issue and how to use scripts to manage what becomes a pretty enormous list of retopo and UV parts.</p><p>I thought I knew 3D Coat inside out, but I learned a lot from this process,l including some little known workflows, and you will too.</p><p>This is not a course on general 3D retopo best practices but more about how to manage retopo and UV worflows in 3d coat when dealing with many many scene objects.<br></p>",
