Most of us might sketch out a character as a whole painting when we start drawing ~ everything is all one layer, on one piece of paper.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That's how most of us draw right?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So then I realized all we have to do then is re-think this character and re-draw it in layers and then . . . we can rig it an animate it; tell a story with it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course I wanted to teach you how to do this by providing a human character drawn in layers so that you will know how to apply this to one of your sketches (you'll know how you can re-draw your own character into layers similar to the character provided) and apply all the rigging techniques to your own artwork in the future. <em>I chose a human because anything else is typically easier to do. ~ especially if they are more 'cartoon or non-realisticly painted'.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Okay so here’s What You’ll Learn Inside the Course . . .</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#1</strong> - SETTING UP AE - Easily set up After Effects with some free Massive Time-Saving tools.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#2</strong> - EYES - Blinking and Movement</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#3</strong> - LIP-SYNC - Mouth’s ability to react to replaceable audio tracks (very cool)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#4</strong> - FACE - Facial Expressions (which still work with talking)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#5</strong> - HAIR - To be able to move in the wind &amp; react to Head Movement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#6</strong> - LEGS - Inverse Kinematics (IK) including Ankle &amp; Foot Articulation</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#7</strong> - ARMS - IK as well as opening and closing Hands &amp; Fingers</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#8</strong> - SECONDARY CLOTHING - Adding a dress/skirt which moves with underlying legs</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#9</strong> - ANIMATE - Set up a Scene for a short animation including a Walk-Cycle</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">#10</strong> - EXPORTING - Add in some music and get an animation ready for Youtube etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>         <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">AND MORE . . .</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With all the artwork provided for you to learn character rigging from start to finish I also walk you through setting up a free plugin called <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">DUIK</strong> which speeds the rigging process up tremendously.
