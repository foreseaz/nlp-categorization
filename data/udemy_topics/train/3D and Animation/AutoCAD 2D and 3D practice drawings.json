The drawings are used in such a way that you have to use most of the tools for making them and each practice drawing will some specific command sin detail.</p><p>The last section has some 3D solid model and surface modelling drawings with complex geometries. These are mainly representation drawings and not standard engineering drawings, the drawings are focussed at teaching key concepts around some specific draw and modify commands of 3D modelling workspace.</p><p><strong>At the end of this course you will be able to: </strong></p><ul><li>Apply skills learnt in AutoCAD to real world scenario. </li><li>learn multiple applications of AutoCAD tools</li><li>Draw 2D and 3D complex drawings</li></ul>",
