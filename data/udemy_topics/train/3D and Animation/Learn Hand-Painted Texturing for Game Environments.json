    "description": "<p>  \t    In this course, we're going to be exploring the process of modeling and hand painting a rickety old cabin! We'll start off by reviewing the concept art and blocking out some base shapes, and from there jump into the wonderful world of UV unwrapping. Next, we'll be taking a look at the different stone, metal, and wood surface types we'll be painting, discuss and decide where we can save some texture resolution by sharing UV space, and then get moving on bringing the texture and visual look and feel of this low-poly cabin to life!  </p>  <p>  \t    <strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong>  </p>  <hr>  <p>  \t<u><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>  <p>  \t  An adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom. Currently working as a texture artist and character modeler with Telltale Games, Ryan spends most of his time painting and sculpting. Zbrush, Photoshop, and Maya are like breathing to him, and he is always looking to share his knowledge. Ryan has been teaching for several years, and is experienced as both an instructor and an industry professional.  </p>",
