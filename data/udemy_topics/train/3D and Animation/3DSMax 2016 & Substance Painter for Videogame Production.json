Learn 3Ds Max with the Basics &amp; Beyond Chapter and how to model and unwrap efficiently in the following hours featuring the AKM. Create textures as close to photo realism as possible with Substance Painter and make the portfolio shine by creating renders with Marmoset Toolbag 2. At the end we are going to post process those renders in Photoshop to get that extra edge out of it. This Course has it all.</p><p><u><strong>Software used:</strong></u> 3Ds Max 2016, Photoshop, Substance Painter and Marmoset Toolbag 2.<br></p><p><em>Important: the modeling part of the tutorial makes heavy use of the \"chamfer\" modifier which is only available in 3Ds Max 2015 and 2016. If you have an older version of 3Ds Max you can instead google for a third party modifier called \"quad chamfer\".</em></p>",
