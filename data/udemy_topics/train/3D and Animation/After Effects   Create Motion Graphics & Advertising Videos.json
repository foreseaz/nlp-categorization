We are always updating this course &amp; adding new lectures regularly, so please watch our announcements.\n\n  </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn how to create amazing motion graphics &amp; advertising videos with After Effects. \n\n  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to create high quality motion videos and want to build a business? Then this course is for you. This course is specially designed to teach you that how we can use After Effects to create awesome motion graphics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, we have designed this course in such way that you will get mastery over creating motion videos. We have not just covered tools, but also taught many tips &amp; tricks. Because when we work on real project, knowing tools or effects are not just sufficient, you must know how to handle different problems. So, we have adopted project based learning approach. In each section we have included a project that will tell you how we create real motion graphics. We will be covering these projects during our course:</p><ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll create simple photo gallery animation.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll learn how to create a web login animation.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll learn how to create shape morphing animation &amp; how to build transitions.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll create a small key unlocking animation to understand the power ofÂ   trimming paths.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll create custom backgrounds using just one layer using power of</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> repeater.</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll learn how to move control motion of any object to get a realistic animation.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll learn how to create real shape morphing animation.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll use the power of 3D &amp; will create a real 3D cube.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll create a complex 3D animation.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'll learn how build an actual 3D globe.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>We have included project files with each project which you can download &amp; it will help you to stay with us.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed for all levels, starting from basics, and then advanced concepts of animation. We have covered all dimensions in detail, from working with shape layers, adjustment layer, power of null object, text, classical &amp; ray-trace 3D along with rendering. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Here is a glimpse of what we'll be covering:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">After Effect Basics (Getting familiar with layout working process)</strong>\n\n  </li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Deeper understanding of compositions</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Understanding different footage options</strong>\n\n  </li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Working with different types of layer &amp; learning tools\n</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Detailed study of layer &amp; shape properties\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Advanced concepts of Masking\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Detailed study of graph editor\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Doing projects like Shape Morphing Animation &amp; others\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Advanced animation concepts like repeater, trimming path etc\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Animating text &amp; understanding different options\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Understanding built-in particles\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Creating and animating 3D objects\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Creating true 3D objects with Ray-Trace 3D\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Different tips for rendering like a pro\n\n  </strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to earn by creating videos</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">and much more</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After Effect is one of the best tools which is in high demand &amp; highly marketable. It will enable to get jobs quickly and help you to build your brand. I've landed many jobs with the skills that I teach you in this course.</p>",
