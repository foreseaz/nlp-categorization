Use the clever components to define an efficient and powerful system of interconnected components, creating geometry and applying geometric and mathematical operations.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  Learn the same techniques innovative architectural offices apply</strong>, such as Foster of Hadid, to develop their complex designs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  Use a combination of modeled and generated geometry and <strong style=\"\">still allow visual, artistic control</strong> over the result.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  In a series of around three hours of video tutorials and a few short quizzes we learn Grasshopper, a parametric design add-in for McNeel Rhinoceros, which can be freely used, provided you have access to Rhinoceros.  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The first lectures will explain the user interface and the basic concepts to control numbers, points and curves.</li>  \t<li>We extend this into 3D Surfaces and look at different approaches for panelling and subdividing of a façade or roof model.</li>  \t<li>There will be an extensive section where you’ll create a model that is similar to a twisted tower design by Calatrava, built in Sweden, step-by-step.</li>  \t<li>And finally, we’ll take a look at options for generative modelling, where we look at optimisation, using the Galapagos module.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  So please join us and discover this widely popular visual programming system and discover how you can create some surprising results with ease.  </p>",
