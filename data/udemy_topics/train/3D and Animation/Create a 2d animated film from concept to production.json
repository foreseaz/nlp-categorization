    "description": "<p>This course begins with how to go from storyboarding, to creating an animatic. Then we rig and prepare dynamic characters and assets including background paintings, to be animated with Adobe After Effects. In using Adobe After Effects we strategically use the amazing DUIK 2d character rigging plug-in to demonstrate the power that this plug-in can offer and how we can utilize its potential to create nearly effortless animated characters. At this point we then move on with blocked in animation to detailed animation to final rendering, and continuing to then add audio effects and music to our film. When the course is titled from \"concept to production\", it's all of that and more!!! You will be able to create your own 2d production quality animated films with ease, the real power of this is just knowing how to go about the entire process, and with this course you will know how!</p>",
