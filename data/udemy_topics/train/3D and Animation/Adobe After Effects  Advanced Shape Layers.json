I highly recommend taking <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/aftereffects#/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">After Effects: Motion Graphics for Beginners</strong></a> before taking this course. But for those of you with After Effects experience, jump right in!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       The course starts with video tutorials on shape theory and techniques. We go over the basic process of creating shape motion graphics. Then we go dive deeper by using these shape layer animations to create professional motion graphic projects. I&#039;m with you every step of the way, and am always available for questions.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">BONUS: </strong>Follow along with a downloadable project files.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Please message me if you have any questions.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       For more information about me, the instructor, check out my website <a href=\"http://www.VideoSchoolOnline.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">VideoSchoolOnline.com</strong></a>.  </p>",
