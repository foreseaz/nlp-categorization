You will start your design project from scratch by importing the needed assets, then learning 3D design and animation by seeing how you would apply this skill in real life.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Course Materials</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Course files include the 3ds Max project files, as well as all the art and textures needed to complete this project.  </p>",
