This course will guide the student step by step through every process involved in bringing their idea or drawing into the physical form. 3D printing is changing the way we design and buy our products. Unleash your creative side with this incredible process and stay ahead of the curve by seeing your products quickly without the huge investment. </p>\n\n<p>The course includes a simple model of a smart phone to help with the design stage of the mobile phone stand. This course is structured so students gain an understanding of the processes involved early on and by the end should be competent to begin their very own creations.</p>",
