    "description": "<p>In this class we will be discussing how to use Adobe After Effects to create special effects like those you have seen in the Star Wars film. This might be seem like a daunting task, but if you have the adobe creative cloud package and some patience and can imitate what I show you in the videos it should be fairly simple to create the effect. Seeing myself holding a lightsaber like what I saw in the films was always sort of childhood fantasy for me and now I can actually get pretty close to what we see in movies.</p><p>By watching these videos you will understand how After Effects uses masks, built in effects and colors, along with the process of adjusting videos frame by frame. For me as I was learning these things I started to understand the process of after effects and how the same tools are used for different visual effects. Once I created a simple 3 second video of a lightsaber I was motivated and stimulated to keep making different movies with these effects. My goal is that this information is digestable and you can begin to see the potential of the program combined with your own vision and creativity.</p>",
