We will be covering how to create our drawing utensils inside After Effects as well without any outside resources such as images.</p><p>I have provided the project file that I will be using through this course. I supply this in order to allow you to follow along with me as I reference specific compositions and folders. This also allows students to dive into the example compositions and open up the effect properties and play around with properties that we may not have covered in the course.</p><p>What are you waiting for? Let's create some completely customizable drawing animations.</p>",
