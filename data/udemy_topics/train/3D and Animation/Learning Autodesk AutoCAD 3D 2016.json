    "description": "<p>In this AutoCAD 3D 2016 training course, expert author Seth Cohen will show you how to use the powerful tools available in this computer aided design software from Autodesk. This course is designed for the 3D beginner, but it is recommended that you are familiar with the basics of AutoCAD before attempting this course.</p>\n\n<p>You will start with an introduction to 3D modeling and how to navigate and work in AutoCAD 3D. Seth will then jump into teaching you how to create 3D models, covering topics such as wireframes, surface modeling, primitive solid models, and creating models from 2D profiles. This video tutorial will also teach you how to create composite solids, add detail with filleting and chamfering, and edit the solid models. You will also cover modifying the model position, duplicating the model, converting 2D objects to solids or surfaces, and viewing and plotting your models. Finally, you will learn about rendering, recording an animation, and using ShowMotion for presentations.Â </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of creating, editing, rendering, and presenting your own 3D models using AutoCAD 3D. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.</p>",
