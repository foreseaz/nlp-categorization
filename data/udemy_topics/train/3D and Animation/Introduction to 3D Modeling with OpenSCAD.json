    "description": "<p>  \tThis short course will teach you everything you need to get started with OpenSCAD. OpenSCAD is a free code based 3D modeling tool in which complex 3D models can be built using the principles of constructive geometry and extrusion. Through 3 illustrative examples, we will cover the creation of basic shapes and the use of operations to combine these shapes into complex structures. This is a great class for hobbyists and 3D printing enthusiasts who are new to OpenSCAD. Students of all ages and backgrounds will enjoy seeing the beautiful and complex designs that can be created in OpenSCAD using only a few lines of code.  </p>",
