    "description": "<p>In this course, we will be learning the necessary skills to prepare and hand paint a 3D Creature for game production. Starting from the baking process, we will cover all the necessary skills that a texture artist will need to paint a character. After we get some of the technical parts out of the way the real fun can start: Painting. We will be covering techniques for painting in a very stylized color scheme, focusing on balancing values and colors to create a great looking creature. We will cover many materials from skin to metal, and showcase methods to make each material really sing. Our end result will be a final portfolio piece that shows off your painting prowess!</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>Chad Robert Morgan started his career at LucasArts where, as a newbie to the industry, was fortunate enough to work with some very talented mentors who taught him how to use Maya. Since then, Chad has been trying to pay it forward by sharing what he has learned, first by giving lectures at Autodesk Master Classes, then publishing an article in 3D World magazine, posting tutorials on YouTube, and finally teaming up with 3dmotive. Chad currently lives in Lake Forest, CA with his wife Carol and his son Xander.</p>",
