    "description": "<p>In this beginner level tutorial we will focus on the creation of a simple vehicle for mobile or low resolution games with a stylized, hand painted ascetic. Beginning with modeling in Maya, we will cover some basic modeling principles before moving into preparing UV's for painting. Painting will take place using 3D Coat, a software package that allows for the rapid texture painting required of many production studios, with final edits taking place in Photoshop. The end result will be a low-rez vehicle that will be usable in most game engines available today.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>An adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom.
