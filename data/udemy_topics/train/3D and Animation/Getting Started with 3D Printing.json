Well, this isn&#039;t science fiction completely.. it&#039;s almost 100% possible thanks to 3D Printing.  </p>  <p>  \t3D Printing, or additive manufacturing, is a way to build real objects using a three dimensional electronic robot/device based off using 3D CAD models (computer aided drafting). The technology is still in early stages but it&#039;s quickly becoming the best way for anyone to make prototypes and cool objects that wouldn&#039;t have been possible ever before.  </p>  <p>  \tLearn how to prototype products and even create functional objects for your home, office, or even as unique gifts for friends.  </p>  <p>  \tEnjoy!  </p>",
