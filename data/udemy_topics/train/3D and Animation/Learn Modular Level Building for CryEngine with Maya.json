Here he will be teaching topics ranging from the initial planning phase and breakdown of a concept to determine the modular pieces needed, to the creation of set models and tileable textures, as well as the final stages of getting your models and textures into CryEngine. Finally, we&#039;ll cover the process of actually building the environment set and bringing it all together, and move on to creating lights for your final render.</p><p>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</p><hr style=\"\"><p><u style=\"\">More about the Instructor:</u></p><p>Emiel Sleegers is a self-taught 3d artist currently residing in the Netherlands.
