People are often intimidated by AutoCAD and think it takes years of experience to operate effectively, but this too is a misconception.</p><p>You are going to walk into this course perhaps never having even SEEN AutoCAD before, and by the end, you'll be CONFIDENTLY designing complex, piped systems from scratch.  What's more, you'll be creating virtual, 3D solid models of these systems and then generating all of the drawings necessary to fabricate and assemble your system!  </p><p>Once you learn the material in this course, there really is no limit to what you'll be able to design, model and draw.  </p>",
