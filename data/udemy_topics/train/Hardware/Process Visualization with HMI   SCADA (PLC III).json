    "description": "<p>As a PLC programmer, there are two sides of the coin that you MUST know to get the job done, and those are the PLC and the HMI.  In my first two PLC courses, you learned the ins and outs of PLC and have already created some pretty complex programs to run machines.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if people aren't able to interact with those machines, they aren't going to be of much use!  In this course, you're going to learn about HMI and SCADA by creating graphical interfaces operators will use to monitor automated process, establish operating parameters, and even acquire and warehouse data from a running system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple solutions on the market to accomplish these tasks, and as such, we're going to be covering several.  Wonderware (Schneider Electric / Indusoft) is perhaps the top solution in the world of process visualization.  As such, we'll be working extensively with that technology, but we won't limit ourselves to a single package.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We'll also be working hands-on with EasyBuilder 5000 and AdvancedHMI, and hands-off with FactoryTalk View Studio and C-More so by the end of this course, you're going to actually know and have working experience with most of what people are using in the world of automation today.</p>",
