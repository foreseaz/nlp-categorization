    "description": "<p>This course starts with the basic idea about circuits, ohm's law, Kirchoff's laws. The simplification of series and parallel circuits is analyzed in great depth. The course also gives an in depth analysis of Series and Parallel circuits (calculation of I, V, P).</p>\n\n<p>The Course helps the students to solve the problems involving Series and Parallel circuit elements. The Power Dissipation in the individual Resistors are calculated.Â </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have designed this course as six Sections:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Section 1 deals with the Ohm's Law and the Introduction about Series and Parallel Circuits</li><li>Section 2 stresses on how to calculate the Equivalent Resistance for a circuit which has circuit elements both in Series and Parallel fashion</li><li>Section 3 analyzes the Series Circuits - Calculation of Voltage drop and the Power Dissipation in the individual Resistors</li><li>Section 4 explores the Parallel Circuits - Calculation of Current and the Power Dissipation in the individual Resistors</li><li>Section 5 analyzes the circuits which are having both the Series and Parallel Combination of Circuit elements</li><li>Section 6 deals with the Kirchoff Current and Voltage Law, Current Division rule and Voltage Division Rule</li></ul>",
