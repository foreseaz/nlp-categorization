With state-of-the-art graphics, physics and dynamic sound, Factory I/O immerses users in a realistic <strong style=\"\">3D industrial environment </strong>. With this real time sandbox, users can edit pre-built industrial systems or build new ones. All systems are completely interactive and can be controlled by a wide range of technologies</p><p> <strong style=\"\">Note: </strong> Student license has <strong style=\"\">unlimited access to all drivers and the SDK, a .NET Framework 2.0 assembly</strong>, which enables inter-process communication (IPC) between FACTORY I/O and the user&#039;s own applications.
