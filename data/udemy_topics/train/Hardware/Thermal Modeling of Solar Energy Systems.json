Examples would include an airplane sitting on a runway in the sun, electronic equipment exposed to solar heating, passive solar heating of buildings and houses, solar power plants or heating of automobile dashboards.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t This class is based on MSC Software&#039;s Patran, Sinda and Thermica.  If you have access to these packages you will be able to complete the step by step tutorial problem.  If you don&#039;t have access to the software, you will still learn the process of creating a thermal model with solar heating.  </p>",
