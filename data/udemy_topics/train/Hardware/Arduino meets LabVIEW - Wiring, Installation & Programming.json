This course will work best for you if you own an Arduino UNO.  Later you will learn how to <strong style=\"\">interface the Arduino with LabVIEW</strong>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tArduino can be used in your<strong style=\"\"> Engineering projects,</strong> <strong style=\"\">Industrial Projects</strong> or <strong style=\"\">Home Automation</strong> related projects.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">Why Learn Arduino?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      If you an Engineering or Science student you might come across projects in which you want <strong style=\"\">Physical interaction with your computer system</strong> &amp; to <strong style=\"\">display the operations on PC Screen</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Arduino </strong>is one of the <strong style=\"\">cost effective board</strong> you can purchase &amp; starts programming to interact physical elements with your logic &amp; create results the way you want.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAnd using <strong style=\"\">LabVIEW</strong> , you can display the various process parameters like <strong style=\"\">Motor Speed, LED ON/OFF Feedback, Temperature Signal &amp; many others digital or analogue processes.</strong> Moreover, you can create <strong style=\"\">unlimited Buttons, Switches &amp; Message Box</strong> to control the Arduino  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">Moreover, by learning Arduino you can create Innovative Projects. You just need to THINK, WIRE &amp; CODE.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Brief Outline:</strong>  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">High Quality Video Tutorials on <strong style=\"\">Arduino Wiring (Fritzing)</strong>, Arduino <strong style=\"\">Programming </strong>&amp; <strong style=\"\">Interfacing with LabVIEW</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\">Includes Arduino E-books &amp; Circuit Diagrams</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Includes LabVIEW Codes, Aps</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Arduino Programming using C Language</li>  </ol>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Arduino used: </strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>Arduino UNO</li>  \t<li style=\"\">ATMega 328 Micro-controller</li>  \t<li style=\"\">14 Digital Input/ Output Pins</li>  \t<li style=\"\">PWM Output (8 Bit)</li>  \t<li style=\"\">6 Analog Inputs (10 Bits)</li>  \t<li style=\"\">USB Programmable</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">LabVIEW Version required</strong>: <strong style=\"\">2009 </strong>or later (We have used <strong style=\"\">2013 </strong>version in the videos)  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Will you get the Certificate?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t You&#039;ll get a certificate of completion after you completed this course. Anyways in the world of web development a certificate is not as important as in other careers. Tech companies nowadays hire developers judging by their past projects, experience and skills. It&#039;s guaranteed that no company will hire you just because you have a degree or a certificate on the wall.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tFor any queries &amp; help, we are just an E-mail away!  </p>",
