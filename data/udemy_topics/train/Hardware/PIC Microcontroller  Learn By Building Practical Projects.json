    "description": "<p>•Learning by theory and Simulation is only half the answer, but connecting, wiring and burning a code to an actual Microcontroller not a simulated one is the other more important half.</p>\n\n<p> •Learning By doing is what makes the different between some one who learn and some one who applies what he learned, and in this course you will get the chance to see PIC Microcontroller in Action, starting from simulation and moving forward to connecting the hardware and testing the code in real life, so that you can make sure your circuit works as expected and you can witness yourself building your first PIC Microcontroller fully functional, useful Project that will make your life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> •The most important thing to note here is that when a circuit work with you in simulation, that doesn’t mean that it will work in real life, in more than 85% of the cases the simulated circuit doesn’t work when you connect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
