    "description": "<p>This course teaches the System-On-Chip design verification in VLSI industry using System-Verilog language. This will be a good starting point to learn System-Verilog language for IC/SOC verification. It covers the fundamentals of the language and explain the concepts from the basics.</p>\n\n<p>This course contains video lectures of 1 hour duration. It is stared by explaining what  is  design and verification code in System Verilog and how they are different. It explains the language constructs like datatypes, arrays and operators in next session with examples. Different kind of assignments in SV are explained in detail with their behavior in simulation. The control flow statements and looping statements are demonstrated  in the next session. Finally, the thread launching mechanism is explained at the end</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking this course, the a student will be able to start learning System Verilog for verification and master it slowly. This course will also be helpful for the HDL programmers who know something about SV programming but not clear about its structured writing.<br></p>",
