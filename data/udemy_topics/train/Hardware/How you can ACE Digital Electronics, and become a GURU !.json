This course <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\"></em></strong><em style=\"\">won&#039;t cover everything</em><strong style=\"\"> </strong><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">but <br style=\"\">this is where you start </strong>Digital Electronics</em>. </p><p style=\"\">The Electronics field is begging for people who can understand its theory and implement it in hard circuitry that gets jobs done. Electronics knowledge is critical to being the independent self-sufficient person you want to and need to be.</p><p style=\"\"> This course is about creating, and running Electronics, specifically Digital Logic Gates in <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">CIRCUITS THAT</em></strong><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> YOU WILL CREATE</strong></em>  using excellent electronic-circuit freeware. </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        You gotta have a PC with Windows software to follow me, and an Internet connection, no more.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        The course will last over an hour, about 71 minutes, and demands involvement on your part. &quot;<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Demands</strong></em>&quot; is the critical word.</p><p style=\"\">You will <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">watch me build </strong>simple electronic circuits<strong style=\"\"> using sophisticated components </strong>like the<strong style=\"\"> AND, OR,  NOT, <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">NAND</strong></em>,<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> NOR </strong></em> and XOR Gates. </strong></em></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">You will see me do it <strong style=\"\">step by step</strong></em> and you will closely follow along on your PC and software. That way you will be able to <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">do it yourself</em></strong>, because that is what a Guru does. Gurus can do it themselves easily.</p><p style=\"\"> You will then <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">learn about and </em><em style=\"\">transcribe Truth Tables </em></strong>from right off the circuits that you yourself created while watching me. When you can do all this yourself blindfolded, You own Guru status in this realm.   My job is to maximize your understanding of this material and minimize the time it takes for you to reach that Guru status level.</p>  <p style=\"\">  So, let me ask you:  <strong style=\"\">Do you want to further your career</strong> and:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>Become <strong style=\"\">more independent </strong>? </li><strong style=\"\"></strong><li><strong style=\"\">Make </strong>electronics that perform meaningful practical tasks ? </li><strong style=\"\"></strong><li><strong style=\"\">Sell </strong>them ? </li><li>Make <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">oodles of money</strong></em> doing so ? </li><li>Become a <strong style=\"\">Guru </strong>in Electronics ?</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Then t</em></strong><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">his is where you begin. </em></strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\"></em>So begin <em style=\"\">now</em>, procrastination is poison.     <em style=\"\">Sign up</em>,  and I&#039;ll see you in the course !</strong><br style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\"></em></strong></p>",
