With respect to few years ago, when the<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> access to the information</strong> was very difficult, now we can have the possibility to have good material fast and for free.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But… <em>There is the other side of the coin</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It is true that we have a lot of information for free, but not all the information we have is a good stuff. Many times we need a huge amount of time to filter good stuff from a useless material.
