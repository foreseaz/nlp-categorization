I have been building my own computers for nearly <strong>10 years</strong> now, and it is both a valuable skill &amp; extremely fun to do! Understanding the inner-workings of a computer will help you <strong>troubleshoot problems</strong>, build superior custom PC's, <strong>save money</strong> selecting your own components, and elevate your <strong>technical skills</strong>!</p><p>If you work in an office or some other administrative job, chances are you spend most of your day using a computer. In fact, computers are typically the most used piece of equipment in both our personal &amp; business lives. I have worked in corporations where administrators were often at the mercy of the <strong>IT department</strong>, because people in general know very little about how computers actually work. So, learn how to build your very own personal computer today, and level up your technical skills!</p>",
