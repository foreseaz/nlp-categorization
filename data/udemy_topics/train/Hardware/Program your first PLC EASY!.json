    "description": "<p>  \t  What you are going to learn within the next hours of my course, which I really hope that you will enjoy, is <strong>how to program your first PLC</strong>, by examining step by step the basic parts that comprise a modern Programmable Logic Controller, using Schneider Electric Zelio Logic.  </p>  <p>  \t  To be more precise, we are going to start with a small refreshing of basic knowledge on the “heart” of a PLC, see what are the basic staff that a PLC is made of, and later on we will examine PLC’s mind, in order to “capture” the key elements inside PLC Ladder and mainly Function Block Diagram (FBD) programming languages standard...  </p>  <p>  \t  Following that, we will start by analyzing one by one and step by step all the programming elements involved, from the simplest to the most complex, both analogue and digital, while at the same time we will take a detailed tour in the FBD programming environment.  </p>  <p>  \t  As soon as we describe software's programming elements, we will begin programming our first example in FBD language, having in mind how to use most of our resources, fast &amp; proffesionally, the EASY way!!  </p>  <p>  \t  Finally when we finish this course above all I hope that you will be ready to start programming your first PLC in FBD language, by knowing how to implement a 5S methodology in your future PLC programming.  </p>  <p>  \t  What i have learned from all my years of experience is, that it doesn’t matter if you are an electrician, an academic, or an IT programmer…  </p>  <p>  \t  What really makes the difference is, having someone to show you the easiest way, on how to be clear and methodical….since after all “PLC is for everyone!!”  </p>",
