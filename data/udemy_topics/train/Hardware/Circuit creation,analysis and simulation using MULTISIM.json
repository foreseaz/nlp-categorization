    "description": "<p>Use coupon code <strong>get50</strong> to get it for $10.</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed with an aim to teach National Instument's software multisim which is widely used all over electronics industry to analyse and study the performance of circuits.   While doing this course student will gain knowledge about circuit designing,simulation  and performing analysis on the circuits . This  course will help electronics and electrical engineering graduates in understanding electronics more closely.  Knowledge of multisim will give you an edge over others in the electronics industry .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Course structure is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p> 1 .Understanding multisim platform .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  2 .circuit designing and simulation . </p>\n\n\n\n<p> 3 .verification of circuits operations using multisim . </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several examples like working of half wave rectifier,full wave rectifier,voltage regulator,half adder and full adder,low pass  filter,high pass filter,band pass filter ,Gates and many more has been discussed and their performance has been studied and their theoritical   results has been verified with the multisim simulated results .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course ,you will be comfortable in using multisim for all the academic and professional purposes</p>",
