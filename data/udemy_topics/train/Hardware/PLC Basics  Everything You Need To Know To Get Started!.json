Perfect for anyone who want to follow along using a Windows 7 or XP compatible PC!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then for the majority of the course you'll learn to write, download, and test over a dozen PLC programs, all based on real world examples! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In them, you'll learn how to use Bit, One Shot, Latch, Timer, Counter, Math, Compare, and File instructions with both the free PLC Emulator, as well as with Allen-Bradley PLCs using serial and Ethernet communications.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And if you're not completely satisfied, and don't feel you can give PLC Basics a <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">full five stars</em> for meeting it's claim of being able to teach you how to use and program PLCs, you are encouraged to return it for a full refund using <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Udemy's 30 day no questions asked guarantee!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">So what are you waiting for? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You no longer have to hope someone will take you under their wing, or that the boss will spend thousands of dollars to send you off to factory training!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">With PLC Basics, you can learn how to use and program PLCs today!</strong></p>",
