    "description": "<p>This course is designed to teach you how to use KiCad assuming no prior knowledge in PCB design. My objective is to help you reach a high level of competency. </p><p>You will be able to create any PCB that an Arduino or general electronics enthusiast can dream of.</p><p>To achieve this, I have organized this course around three projects. With each project, I introduce several new KiCad features and extend your skill set.<br></p><p>The ability to create a custom PCB is a core skill of an electronics enthusiast. Without the ability to create a custom PCB, your breadboard-based projects are doomed to oblivion. </p><p>Learning how to use KiCad will make you a better maker because you will be able to create custom PCBs for your best designs, and as a result you will ensure that they realise their full potential. <br></p>",
