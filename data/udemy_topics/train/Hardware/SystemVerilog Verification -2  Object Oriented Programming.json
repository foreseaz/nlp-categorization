    "description": "<p>This course teaches the SystemVerilog language used in the VLSI industry for System-On-Chip design verification. This is primarily focusing on the Object Oriented Programming (OOPs / OOP) concepts of SystemVerilog.</p>\n\n<p>This course contains video lectures of 1.5 hours duration. It is stared by explaining what  is  Object Oriented Programming and  how it is used for TB writing. It explains the concepts of using array and structures in any programming language and comes to the idea of using in classes thereafter. The definition, creation and usage of objects are described in detail. </p><p>The basic OOPs concepts - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance &amp; Polymorphism are explained in connection with TB  programs thereafter. It also describes, virtual functions and base/derived class properties. Creation and usage of abstract classes and pure virtual functions are presented and finally parameterized classes in SV are explained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking this course, the you will be able to start using OOPs concepts in SystemVerilog for effective TestBench coding. This course will an excellent platform to grab the magical features of SystemVerilog TB programming who understand the basic of it.</p>",
