    "description": "<p>Did you buy a new computer and you still have the older one lying around? In that case, you probably asked yourself <strong>what to do with that </strong><strong>old PC or laptop</strong> that you really liked... It is still working very well but is just not powerful enough anymore for your current needs. Well, do not trash it yet: you can give it a new life by <strong>transforming it into a very powerful $2,000 server!</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will learn step by step how to use freely available software to do exactly that: take a 64-bit computer that is obsolete by today's standards and turn it into a <strong>NAS</strong> - <strong>Network Attached Storage</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Storing and sharing files is only one of the features of your future server! In this course, you will learn how to use it as a <strong>backup machine</strong> as well as a powerful <strong>media server</strong>... and this is only a small part of what the software is capable of doing.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Synology Inc.</strong> is a Taiwanese corporation that specializes in network attached storage (NAS) appliances. A group of ingenious persons has turned Synology's software into <strong>XPEnology</strong>, which is the program that you will be using to transform your PC. Thanks to them, you will be able to create your own NAS at a fraction of the cost of a Synology server. In fact, if you already have that old computer we talked about earlier, <strong>it will cost you nothing more than about half and hour of your time</strong> to set it up :o)<br></p>\n\n<p>Synology's software being easy to use, I will be showing you the basics to get started. After that, with the <strong>straightforward user interface</strong> of the system, you will very easily go your own way with your new server and add new functionalities according to your needs or desires!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you want to buy a NAS from Synology (which I strongly support and advocate!), this course will show you why they are so goodÂ :o)</strong><strong></strong><br><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Disclaimer:<br>I am not, in any way, affiliated to Synology Inc. or the developers of XPEnology (but I absolutely love their products!)<br>The information contained in this course is for informational and educational purposes only.<br><br></em><em></em></p>\n\n",
