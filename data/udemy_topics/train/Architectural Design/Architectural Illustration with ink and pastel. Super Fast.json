It is by far the easiest method for providing illustrations. The course is a step by step course showing you exactly how to do the rendering. You will have a close up view of exactly how you complete the rendering. The course shows how to develop the illustration of two buildings, a small office building and a dining establishment. Every student should come away with a very strong basis for doing illustrations for yourself or a start in the business of professional rendering.</p>",
