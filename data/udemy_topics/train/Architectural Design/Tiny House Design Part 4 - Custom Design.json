    "description": "<p style=\"\">This is going to be a conversation about how to design your own tiny house. Fact is tiny houses HAVE to be suited for their occupants, there is no &#039;one-size-fits-all&#039; but there are things to consider and think about in your daily life. I will share some of the important questions to ask yourself, some things to consider and give you some general rules and background of design to help make the appropriate decisions. Design is daunting but it&#039;s also systematic and with tiny houses, form really does follow function, there are reasons that one strategy makes sense over others.  In addition to talking about the design of the actual house I will touch on designing your lifestyle!</p><p style=\"\">There are approximately 2 hours of information relating to design, materials, and processes  - as it applies to tiny homes. This course is formatted to provide the information relevant to you and enable you to make the best decision for yourself. If you are excited about tiny houses and how they may empower you this course is for you!<br style=\"\"></p>",
