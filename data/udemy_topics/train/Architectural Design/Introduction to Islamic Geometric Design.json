You will only need a ruler/straight edge, a pencil and a marker to make these patterns. You won&#039;t have to make any calculations, just follow my step by step instructions and you will be amazed at what you can create, using the same design techniques Islamic craftsmen have used for centuries.  I will also show how to tessellate patterns in an efficient way and, importantly, how to<em style=\"\"> embellish</em> patterns. Islamic geometric design is not just about drawing patterns with black lines. What you do to the patterns after you have drawn them, how you make them more beautiful is a very important part of using your personal creativity. I will show some techniques and styles that have been used over the centuries in different part of the Islamic world to make geometric compositions more beautiful.  </p>",
