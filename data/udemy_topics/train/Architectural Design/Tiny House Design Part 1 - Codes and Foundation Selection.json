    "description": "<p>This is going to be a conversation around local and national code issues surrounding Tiny Houses. I will talk about the options you have both locally (to you) and nationally, focusing on the permitting process and alternative paths to legalized tiny house living.  </p><p>As a part of this conversation I will explain the difference between a foundation tiny house and a tiny house on wheels (legally) and the process that each must go through. The MAIN focus of this course will be tiny houses on wheels so I will get into the considerations that will go into picking your foundation (trailer) including both new and used options.  </p><p>There are approximately 2 hours of information relating to history, zoning, codes and foundations - as they apply to tiny homes.  This course is formatted to provide the information relevant to you and enable you to make the best decision for yourself.  If you are excited about tiny houses and how they may empower you this course is for you!<br></p>",
