The lectures are prepared so that they are understood by participants at all levels, from students to professionals in the field of architecture, engineering, drafting, and design. We expect students to have a basic understanding of the terms in architecture or engineering, if not the course will help you anyway since the course is made as a basic introduction to Structural Principles in Tensile Surface Structures. We include pictures and examples that will clarify the basics of Structural Principles in Tensile Surface Structures. We will take a look at Forms in Nature, Minimal Surfaces, Soap Films, Basic Forms and Structural Principles for Tensile Surface Structures.<strong><u></u></strong></p>",
