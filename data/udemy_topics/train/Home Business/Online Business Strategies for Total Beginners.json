I don’t like to think of myself as a “<em>marketing guru</em>” as many experts call themselves. Then only thing that I have been privileged with, is to work for about 10 years in the advertising industry and test out dozens of ideas in tens of markets and see what works and what doesn’t.</p><p><strong>HOW DOES THIS INTEREST ME? </strong>You might ask.</p><p>Well it’s simple…<em>instead of you spending thousands of dollars</em> if not more on advertising to learn from your own mistakes, you will <em>skip all the headaches</em> I had and my years of trial and error. Consider this course your head-ache pill that you take before even feeling any pain.</p><p>And just to make sure…</p><hr><p><em><strong>Do you think I never had failed campaigns? Of course I had.</strong></em></p><hr><p><em>Here are some other failures as well…</em></p><p>Michael Jordan lost over 300 games in his career.</p><p>Dyson had 5,000 failed prototypes before making a vacuum.</p><p>Edison failed 10,000 times before creating the light bulb.</p><hr>EXPERIENCE IS FAILURE.<hr><p>But since we live in this information age, everything is now accessible and you can skip parts if not all of the trial phase by learning from someone who has been there done that.</p><p>I’m not saying, you will be a world class writer after taking this copywriting course, but if you follow the rules and guidelines I laid out for you I guarantee you will be a damn good copywriter.</p><p>Better than most copywriters I’ve seen at top 5 ad agencies anyway…</p><hr><p><strong>SO HERE IS WHAT THIS COURSE WILL DO FOR YOU</strong></p><hr><ul><p>·Help you understand most of the online money making methods</p><p>·Encourage you to start a new venture</p><p>·Give you new ideas to monetize your existing business</p><p>·Be an informative and entertaining experience</p></ul><hr><p><strong>DON’T BELIEVE ME?</strong></p><hr><p>Fine….</p><p>If in 30 days you don’t get all and more of the results I said, feel free to ask for a 100% refund.</p><p>It’s totally within Udemy’s refund policy. And I will ask it for you, that’s how sure I am of the quality and value of this course.</p><p>BUT considering I have 5000+ students so far with 45 reviews with an average of 5 stars I think my word means more than an empty promise to you.</p><hr><p><strong>WHAT THIS COURSE IS BASED ON</strong></p><hr><ul><p>·8+  years of advertising experience</p><p>·Over $100.000 in yearly revenue from some of those strategies</p><p>·At least $5.000 invested in each of those strategies</p></ul><hr><p><strong>TO SUMMARIZE</strong></p><hr><p>What this course will do for you?</p><ul><p>·-help you understand how some online money making strategies work</p><p>·-not waste $$$ of your own time</p><p>·-monetize better your own website</p></ul><p>What this course won’t do for you?</p><p>·-make you an overnight millionare</p><p><em>Besides following the lectures, taking notes, you have to </em>PRACTICE<em>. </em>And you won’t have to do it alone.</p><hr><p><strong>You can ask me anything in the discussions section.</strong></p><hr><p>I offer constant support along the way.</p><p>I answer all questions within the same day to all my courses (Facebook, Twitter, Copywriting). <em>(Weekends as well…yes I am a workaholic).</em></p><p>So whenever you feel stuck, want feedback or just need a push in the right direction feel free to reach out.</p><hr><p><strong>ALSO, I MADE IT EASY FOR YOU</strong></p><hr><p>I put a lot of effort in creating video animations so you will find this easy to follow and remember because of the fun and relevant visuals.</p><p>Also you have additional resources in case you want to become even better at some of the topics covered.</p><p>Print ready snapshots of the lectures that you can easily look at without having to scroll through the full videos.</p><p>And quizzes that you can take and solidify your understanding of the principles and concepts of copywriting.</p><hr><p><strong>Seriously NOW?

So if you really want to get better at copywriting, I honestly encourage you to take this course.</em></p>",
