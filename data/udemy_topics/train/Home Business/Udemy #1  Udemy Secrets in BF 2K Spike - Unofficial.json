She covers a great deal of information in the course itself, but she's also always active with answering questions in the discussion area to cover any clarification I need to make the most of what I'm learning. In this course, she shows behind-the-scenes, real-world examples of her multiple courses &amp; her earnings, so that you can get a real understanding of the Udemy earnings potential â€¦ even if you don't yet have your own course launched. And I think it's spot-on that she has launched this course in the summer with enough time for even brand-new instructors to *maximize* their earnings in the Black Friday sale in November. Well done and highly recommended.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>_______________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Udemy Success 1: Spike Over 2K Revenue in 10 days during the Black Friday Sales</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every year in November, <strong>Udemy </strong>runs a 10 Day Campaign Race to the Black Friday Sales. It is 'Big Time' for Udemy, Udemy instructors and Udemy students.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This Big opportunity</strong> is open right in front of all Udemy instructors. Even if you are new, you won't be left behind if you take action TODAY! The sad truth is that many seasoned Udemy instructors don't even make money with this wide open door opportunity.  They only have themselves to blame for NOT taking the right action to get BIG results!  This goes for existing and future Udemy instructors!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Time is NOW!  </strong>Anyone can make money on Udemy if they leverage the massive influx of sales during the Black Friday. Black Friday is a frenzy.  Many instructors WILL make lots of money. It is there for you to take should you reach out and grab it! The good news is that anyone can.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>During Black Friday sales,</strong> many hungry buyers are waiting at your doorstep to buy your courses! Just Awesome. In this course, you will watch the amazing scenes behind my Udemy Revenue dashboard.  Not only that,  there are serial buyers there buying ALL of my courses at 'one go'! The sales dashboard keep jumping every minute. The results are there for you to see!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Many of these buyers will buy, but the question is: </strong>\"How do you make sure they buy YOUR courses and not your COMPETITORS?</p>\n\n<p>Many instructors don't make money, PERIOD. It is the truth.  There are so many bad courses on Udemy and even more clueless instructors. How do you go from 'clue-less to clued-in?  <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Good News </strong>is that you can make some changes right away TODAY if you take the right action.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you are a new instructor, you will see BIG result in a very <strong>SHORT time</strong>, especially during the 10 Day Black Friday Sales.  There is no up front cost to put a course at Udemy. </p>\n\n<p>My Revenue Earning hit over 2K in <strong>10 days</strong>.  2K may not be a great success but it is an achievement that fired off to subsequent Udemy successes.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's the Big Secret: </strong>One course hit to the Top Page and have now stayed on as #1 Top PAID in my category ever since November. Once you hit the sweet spot in the Top Paid, sales flow in 'automatically' every month effortlessly from then on.  So it is NOT just good for Black Friday but for your continual success in Udemy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The experience of the Udemy Black Friday Sales</strong> turned many of us beginners to become seasoned successful Udemy Instructors as we quickly learned the ropes of becoming better instructors in course creation &amp; promotion.  You don't have to stay as a beginner for months or for years. I only started in July 2014 with $0 earning in August 2014. But came November 2014, I hit over 2K in 10 days alone.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>This Udemy course is in response to students request.</strong> I thank you that you put so much faith and trust in me.  There is enough time for you to make some breakthrough! I hit over 2K in 10 days, and I am going to show you EXACTLY what I did so that you too can sell a ton of courses this Black Friday! <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>If you are having a difficult time with your Revenue earning in Udemy</strong>, you must TAP into the POWER of the Black Friday Sales to get that BIG BOOST to your online teaching career in Udemy.  Remember, during Black Friday, people are conditioned to spend money. Many instructors do not enjoy discounting their courses but the math is simple.  Would you rather sell 1 course for $129 or sell hundreds for $10,  hundreds for $11, hundreds for $12, etc!  <strong>The answer is simple</strong> when it comes to putting food on the table, a shelter on the head, and providing for the family. The choice becomes very clear. It is much more preferable to sell hundreds or thousands of courses at $10 rather than a few for high cost.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, you gain <strong>MORE</strong> students who are now ready to buy your next course?  Get the idea? </p>\n\n<p>On the first day of Black Friday says, I had <strong>101 new</strong> students buying my courses for $10. I made $500 overnight while sleeping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Know that Udemy is there to help you</strong>. You also need to know how to become successful yourself during the Black Friday Sales. The result is even more rewarding as you watch your courses climbing high into the No. 1 Spot Top Paid in the subsequent months. You also end up doing new launches ending into the New &amp; Noteworthy Section all the time without fail. Your courses get lots of exposure and FINALLY, you are able to enrich the lives of many people with lots of value and passion.<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn from my experience!</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Nothing happens haphazardly!</strong></p>\n\n<p>To win in the Race - You must<strong> </strong><strong>PREPARE WELL!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Preparing Well</strong> is the Key.
