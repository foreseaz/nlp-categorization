I try to make this course as to the point and informative as possible so that you can quickly start making Udemy videos and share your knowledge on the subjects you're interested in. The reason why you will want to take this course is because you will be saving time learning how to make videos and not have to go through all the troubles I did learning through trial and error. The three different programs we cover are: OBS (Open broadcasting Software), Screen Cast O Matic, and Windows Movie Maker. I also show you how to promote your courses on Facebook and briefly explain how you should promote your lessons through SEO. Additionally, I will be sure to help you along the way with any questions you have about this course and how to become successful at creating Udemy courses. </p>",
