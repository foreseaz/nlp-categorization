And often times, they buy the Instructors' new courses even before they have a chance to look at their promotional videos?  They seem to trust the Instructor so much already!</p>\n\n<p><strong>And sometimes when I look at my dashboard,</strong> I see NEW students buying my courses one after another within the span of 5 minutes, isn't this incredible?  It is as if the student suddenly found you:  \"Eureka!\"  And the sales on the dashboard continue and continue until all your courses are bought by that same student!  I have had that happening to me many times at Udemy.  </p>\n\n<p>Why do students do that?</p>\n\n<p><strong>And then you see other Udemy instructors struggling </strong>and busying themselves with lots of promotion and marketing effort, but people are 'not biting'.  They are not buying their courses. Is this your situation?  I am here to help and that's why I created this course for you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here's the Udemy Secret:</strong>  You need to understand that when it comes to marketing your courses, there are 2 streams:  internal marketing &amp; external marketing.  Which one do you think is more important?  Too many people go right into the 'external' marketing without spending enough time to get their 'internal' marketing effectively going.  </p>\n\n<p>Internal marketing <strong>MUST</strong> precede external marketing.  Once you get internal marketing going, the external marketing is easy to do!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Udemy is a powerful platform for Udemy instructors to do internal marketing.</strong>  And even in  'internal marketing' at Udemy, there is <strong>ONE</strong> secret tip of marketing that takes FIRST PRIORITY - Branding yourself as a Udemy Instructor!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tap into this Udemy Marketing Tip:</strong>  There are many Udemy instructors in the Udemy platform and you need to 'stand out' among the thousands of instructors there.  If your name does not even strike any bell in the Udemy platform, even if there are millions of students out there, they are no use to you. They won't be knocking at your door.  This is what I have learned in the past year at Udemy.  <strong>You must learn to BRAND yourself as an Instructor! </strong> That is your <strong>top priority</strong> in marketing your courses.</p>\n\n<p>People ask me why I am successful.
