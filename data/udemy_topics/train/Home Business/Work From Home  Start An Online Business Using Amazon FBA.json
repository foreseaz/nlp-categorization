We only improve and get better as a society if we share. Teaching and doing are how people achieve mastery.

There’s more competition, then two years ago. However, Amazon continues to grow and competition is always good. Shows there is demand and innovation going on.</p><p>Those that never want to achieve or get better worry about competition. The opportunity is greater than ever right now but, now ones how long the window will stay open.</p><p>This is why you always focus on building a brand with several products. Just having one is too risky and isn’t a real business.</p>",
