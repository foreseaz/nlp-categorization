And the BEST part is, these items only cost about <strong style=\"\">$0.35</strong>, and we are selling them for<strong style=\"\"> $15 to $19</strong>.  That&#039;s a HUGE profit margin.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     I will also teach you how to <strong style=\"\">guarantee</strong> your listings show up on the very first results page when people are searching Ebay.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Again, this is not just a conceptual course meant to show you the basic functions of Ebay.  <strong style=\"\">This is the exact same, proven system that I use to generate a very nice income on Ebay.</strong>  </p>",
