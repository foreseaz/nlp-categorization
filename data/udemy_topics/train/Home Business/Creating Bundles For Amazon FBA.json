    "description": "<p>This course if designed for the Amazon seller that has realized that Amazon is a very competitive market place and is tired of constantly fighting the \"race to the bottom\"  </p><p>In this course, I focus more on the thought processes and selling strategies for creating bundling products.  This is not a course that's main purpose is to just show you how to create a bundle listing.  </p><p>All the training is screen capture video.  It is like we are sitting together and I am going over the different though processes and strategies  that I believe work best for bundling products for Amazon.</p><p>By the time you finish this course, you should know what it takes to create bundles that will sell and that you can basically \"own\" the buy box on.</p><p><br><br></p>",
