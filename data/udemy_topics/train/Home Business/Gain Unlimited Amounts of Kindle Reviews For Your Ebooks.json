All in all, this is a helpful course.\" - Jeff Gilbert</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"This course will teach you how to get Amazon reviews and how these reviews can increase your sales! Take this course and get your own reviewers now!\" - Joan Cielo Rublico</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Start growing your Kindle business by gaining some reviews for your e-books. No prior knowledge is needed and you do not need a list to start gaining Amazon reviews. <strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>61% of customers read online reviews before making a purchasing decision and research has shown that reviews increase the sales on average by 18%. </strong>This is 18% more sales for free, as you do not need to write additional books, you simply need to get more reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About This Course:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many people will say that you need to ask for reviews from your friends and family members or asking your list. However, <strong>this course is made for people who do not have a following</strong> and you do not have a list of people, who could review your e-book. <strong>If you follow all of the steps in this course, you will create a list of your own reviewers!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to gain organic reviews, if you have 0 reviews. Therefore, <strong>this course focuses on the initial reviews for your Kindle e-books</strong>, because they are the hardest to get. <strong>After getting the initial reviews, people will start to purchase your e-books more and you will see a flood of organic reviews. </strong>Hence, the tactics taught in this course are perfect for using straight after launching a new e-book, but it can be used for older e-books as well!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contents and Overview:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Understanding the benefits</strong> of having <strong>Amazon reviews</strong></li><li>Learning <strong>two different methods</strong> <strong>how to collect email addresses</strong> of any potential reviewers</li><li><strong>Contacting the reviewers</strong> and email templates are provided what you can write to them</li><li><strong>Building a list of your own reviewers</strong> that you are working with</li><li>Learning the <strong>difference between customer and editorial review</strong></li><li>Learning how to <strong>get editorial reviews for free</strong></li><li><strong>A downloadable audio version of the course in MP3 format</strong></li><li>Additional methods of gaining free Amazon reviews, which I think are less effective, but you can still try them out.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additional Benefits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the curriculum and the things you will learn in the course, you will also get the following benefits by taking this course:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Full and lifetime access to the course</strong></li><li><strong>All future extra lectures and upgrades</strong> are always included <strong>for free</strong></li><li><strong>U</strong><strong>nconditional Udemy 30 day money back guarantee </strong>- that is my personal promise of your success!</li><li><strong>My help is available to you</strong>, if you get stuck or have a question</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enrol now</strong> by pressing the <strong>â€œTake This Course\"</strong> button at the top right, since every day you do not use the techniques covered in this course, you potentially lose money as <strong>having more reviews has been proven to increase your sales!</strong></p>",
