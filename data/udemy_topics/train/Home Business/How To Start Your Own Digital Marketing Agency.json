Whether you are a newbie or an experienced marketer.\" - <strong>Raaj Paatkar</strong><strong></strong></p><p>\"I've taken some other courses by John Shea, so when I saw this new course--his most comprehensive yet--I didn't hesitate to buy it. Why you may ask? Because of the two words that come to mind when I think about John and his work: Authenticity and Actionability. Firstly, John is real--he's not just another mass course-producing vending machine that relies on flashy videos and slick promises, but with little substance. </p><p>John actually works full-time in real life, doing exactly what he's teaching in this course. And he takes you right along with him, like he would an apprentice in his own office, and shows you everything with great honesty. Secondly, you will discover many valuable, actionable strategies in this course--from starting up your LLC and website to finding clients and writing up contracts to outsourcing work. Even already established web or seo businesspeople are likely to discover useful tips. So if you want a fluff-free, non-sugar-coated look at what it's really like to have your own digital online marketing agency, and want all of John's insight into how he made his successful, then I strongly recommend for you to sign up now.\" - <strong>Dr. Phillips</strong><strong></strong></p>",
