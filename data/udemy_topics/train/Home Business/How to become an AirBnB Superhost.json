    "description": "<p>Being an AirBnB host is tons of fun. I've met people from all over, made friends and made good money very easily.</p><p>In this course you'll learn everything you need to know to host guests in your home through AirBnB. The first part of the course covers: safety, taxes, marketing your space, adherence to laws and regulations, and a tour of what I do for my guests that made me a Superhost. I also interview another Superhost who does things very differently than I do, so you have a broader view of what it's like to be a host. The second part of the course is a walk through of signing up and listing your space. I show you what I did so you have ideas about what you'll want to do. You're welcome to copy any or none of what is shown as you list your space.</p><p>I provide helpful links to AirBnB resources as well as a few assignments to help you be compliant and successful in all areas of your hosting experience. </p><p>Hosting is a very easy way to make money and becoming a Superhost will increase the number of people who want to stay in your space. This course will show you how to get there from here.</p>",
