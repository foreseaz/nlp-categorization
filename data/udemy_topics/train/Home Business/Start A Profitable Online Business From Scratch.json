I did what most newbies did and used the \"launch and hope\" strategy...and failed miserably. Like 80% of new online businesses, I didn't make money. I ended up frustrated and overwhelmed. I tried every trick from every blog and it went nowhere.</p><p>But on my next business I had a mentor to guide me and a solid plan to follow. </p><p><strong>\"Find a hungry market first, then feed it what it wants.</strong>\" </p><p>Those wise words and a step-by-step blueprint guided my next business, steering me around newbie trap number one (the \"launch and hope\" strategy). My second business made two hundred dollars in the first week, two thousand dollars the second month, and now consistently pays me a profit of two thousand dollars a month (it's on auto-pilot so I spend about an hour a week working on it). My second and third online businesses are doing even better.</p><p>You can follow the exact same step-by-step plan that will walk you through finding the right product to sell, finding the right people to sell it to, and systematically growing your profits month over month.</p><p><strong>What exactly is in the course?</strong></p><p>This course consists of 35 video lectures to be watched in order, containing some basic theory but mostly real-life demonstration of the principles in action. </p><p>Over the course of the videos, you will watch me put the theory into action as I validate, launch, and grow a brand new business from scratch, showing you every step as I make my first sales, build my website, grow my followers, run ad campaigns, build my email list, and grow my profits! </p><p>Many of the lectures have PDF guides, templates, or other supplements meant to make it as easy as possible for you to replicate my results with your own business. </p><p>All of the tools I use are free to get started. You will leverage free tools and free trial software to validate your product and <strong>start making money</strong> <em>before </em>you spend money on web hosting, ad campaigns, or inventory. </p><p>I designed this course to allow an absolute beginner to start from scratch and end up with a real business making real money. Even the more advanced concepts are broken down into simple steps that anyone can follow.</p><p><span></span></p>",
