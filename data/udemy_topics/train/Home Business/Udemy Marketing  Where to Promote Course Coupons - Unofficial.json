Several things happened after our discussion.</p><p>First was that my additional marketing that you had suggested, generated another 120 students.</p><p>The second was that you had suggested that by generating more discussion interaction that might help my Udemy search engine position. It did. I made the coaching offer to my students which generated more discussions. I noticed that just as the number of discussions I had went one more than the #1 position for my keywords, that I suddenly went from my old position #5 to position #1. At least I believe that's what it was. At the same time I was getting more students, but I believe it was the number of discussions. So I'm going to kick that up even further.</p><p><strong>The Best Course On Promoting Your Udemy Course</strong></p><p>Thank you for bringing all of this valuable information together.
