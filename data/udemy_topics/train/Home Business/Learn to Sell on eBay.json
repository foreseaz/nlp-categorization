Think you’d like to try your hand at starting your own business on eBay but don’t know where to begin?<br style=\"\">If so, this course will show you exactly how to get started. The instruction will be entirely video-based. The first lectures will be normal classroom style, and then after that all videos will be views of the instructor&#039;s web browser with the accompanying audio describing what is happening. While this course has almost 2 hours of content, students should expect to spend significantly longer when putting the actual lessons into practice. The instructor will be available on a frequent basis to answer student questions, and live office hours will be held.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p>  ",
