    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is about affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing is one of the ways to make money on the internet so it can be done almost everywhere in the world, including your own home. What I want to do different in this course is to get people to make their own plan, because if everyone uses exactly the same plan there is just too much competition. This course is not super long but it is recommended to watch it about three times to fully understand and remember everything. This course begins (after the introduction) with teaching you how to choose the products you are going to sell as an affiliate and how to do some market research, that is the first part of creating your affiliate marketing business. The next thing is selling the product, this course will teach multiple underground methods, free and paid. After that comes probably the most important part, it's the mental stuff that is going to take you from A to B. In this part you are going to learn the mental things you are going to need. Then there is the end, in the end of the course, the course will be concluded. You should take this course if you are interested in (affiliate) marketing.</p>",
