    "description": "<p>This course will give you a stable foundation for your endeavour of learning German. It is the first part of a complete course that will ultimately lead you to speaking German very well. In video lessons, I will guide you through lectures which are clearly structured, building up on each other and versatile, including not only grammar explanations, but also a lot of video-guided exercises, vocabulary, additional information. After having completed this first part, you will know how to conjugate German regular verbs, the modal verbs, you will be able to make simple sentences containing a subject (the nominative case), a verb and an object (the accusative case). You will know how to spell your name and how to present yourself as well as others. You will be able to ask questions with and without question pronouns. You will know the German numbers and be able to tell the time. You will understand simple forms and be able to fill them in with information about yourself. Should questions come up while learning with my course, please feel free to ask me, I will be happy to answer them. </p>",
