    "description": "<p>  \tThis course has been updated in February 2016</p>  <p>  \tA 30 day challenge to learn enough German to help you feel less daunted and have a great time on your first trip to Germany.  </p>  <p>  \t      If you are a busy person who finds it hard to fit in time for language lessons, then this course is perfect for you!  </p>  <p>  \t      Each topic comes in a bite-sized challenge, lasting no more than 5 - 10 (a few maybe 15) minutes work a day, followed by a revision quiz on the following day.  </p>  <p>  \t      This will be enough to make you feel less uncomfortable when in Germany and people speak to you or you read German instructions.  </p>  <p>  \t      And for the business person, who wants to exhibit in Germany or who is meeting a prospective client - <strong>t</strong><strong>his course may just help you get that deal!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Contrary to popular belief, not all Germans do speak English - and even if they do, a few polite sentences in German may just be what they needed to hear to be persuaded to buy from you.  </p>  <p>  \t  Topics covered are:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>greeting people</li>  \t<li>my name is ...</li>  \t<li>I come from ...</li>  \t<li>I live in ...</li>  \t<li>four little words</li>  \t<li>Do you speak English?</li>  \t<li>Sorry!</li>  \t<li>days of the week</li>  \t<li>numbers from 0 - 10</li>  \t<li>Where isâ€¦?</li>  \t<li>directions</li>  \t<li>ordering drinks</li>  \t<li>ordering food</li>  \t<li>I'm allergic!</li>  \t<li>numbers from 11- 20</li>  \t<li>numbers from 21 - 100</li>  \t<li>What's the time?</li>  \t<li>How much does it cost?</li>  \t<li>buying clothes</li>  \t<li>colours</li>  \t<li>buying train tickets</li>  \t<li>body part and illnesses</li>  \t<li>buying medicines</li>  \t<li>booking a hotel room</li>  \t<li>at the restaurant</li>  \t<li>saying goodbye</li>  </ul>",
