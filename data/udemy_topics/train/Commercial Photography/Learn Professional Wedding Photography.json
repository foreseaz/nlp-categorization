I am  finding the information so incredibly valuable and am even thinking of finally  upgrading my Canon 550D to a 5D MkIII - I am so inspired to capture better  quality shots! - But most importantly, feel confident that my knowledge base  has grown enough to empower me to make an informed decision on this pricey  purchase. </em></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Secondly, how very generous of you  to allow access to your new online venture! I haven&#039;t worked my way through all  of the DVD&#039;s yet, but have started and am enjoying the format</em>.&quot; </p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Cynthia Herdman-Grant</strong></p>  <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">&quot;All going well here. Had a  productive first wedding season with 12 weddings all in all and quite a few  booked for next year. It&#039;s been a very enjoyable learning curve and something I  wouldn&#039;t have been able to start on without your excellent course!&quot;</em></p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Clive Nolan - Original Course Attendee</strong></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">&quot;Let me congratulate you for  the wonderful work you have done to help people like my brother (Noob  Photographer) and me (Noob Videographer). We are trying to start our wedding  video and photography business here in Australia. Your DVD set was really  intuitive and helpful. I must say the investment I made was the best I have  ever made. THANK YOU.&quot; </em></p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Anonymous - Australia</strong></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">&quot;Just wanted to say thanks. I  got the DVD course at the end of last year in preparation for a friend&#039;s  wedding. I gave them the photos last week and they are absolutely thrilled.  Definitely could not have done it without your help. The basic camera setting  you recommend in the DVD was worth the price on its own. I didn&#039;t get a single  badly exposed shot &quot; </em></p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Lee Brookes, UK</strong></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">&quot;Hi</em></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">I have recently retired as a  business services manager with a major company in Crawley West Sussex and  decided to get my qualifications as a professional photographer as I have been  a very keen amateur photographer for well over 40 years I&#039;m also pleased to say  that I have now just completed a photographic course with the Institute of  Professional Photography and was awarded a diploma with merit. </em></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">I just completed my first wedding in  Yorkshire, England is using your settings and advice from your wedding  photography tips course... </em></p>    <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">The good news is I received a telephone call from the bridegroom&#039;s  mother crying with happiness at how pleased she was with my photographs which  gave me a massive confidence boost. I appreciate that most of the good results  were down to my hard work however, the settings you give in your course worked  a treat and I would recommend your video course to anybody who is thinking  about doing wedding photography, whether for one wedding for a friend or family  member or if they are intending to start up their own wedding photography business.  Can&#039;t thank you enough for the confidence your advice has given me in my new  venture as a wedding photographer.&quot; </em><strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  Alan Turner Dip Pro. Phto (Inst P.

Now all I can think of is, Roll on wedding  number two, three,...... etc. etc.&quot; </em>&nbsp;<strong style=\"\">Mick Lumley, IRELAND</strong></p>&lt;/p&gt;",
