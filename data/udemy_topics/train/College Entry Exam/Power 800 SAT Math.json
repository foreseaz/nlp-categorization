    "description": "<p>  \t    This course is a one stop shop to prep for the <strong>math portion</strong> of the newÂ <strong>SAT</strong>.  I have spent almost an entire year studying and categorizing all of the math SAT problems given in the College Board's <strong>Official SAT Study Guide</strong>.  From the analytics I gathered, I created a specially tailored crash course to educate my students in every single aspect of the SAT math sections.</p>\n\n<p>  \t  What separates this course from all the other courses out there is that it is \"frequency based.\"  What does this mean?  You can pick and choose topics based on often they will manifest on the exam.  For example, after simply watching videos on the first 2 categories out of 23, \"Deriving a Formula\" and \"Data Analysis,\" you will be able to cover material that will likely constitute nearly <strong>24%</strong> of the exam!  Here's what is included:</p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li>All necessary rules and operations condensed into just over <strong>two hours</strong> of \"Intro\" lectures</li>  \t<li><strong>Seven hours</strong> worth of material, including explanations of rules along with the guided solving of detailed practice problems</li></ul>",
