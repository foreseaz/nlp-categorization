It is important to prepare for this exam.  Doing well will help qualify you to take courses in your major and facilitate a timely graduation.  A good placement exam score may exempt you from developmental or remedial mathematics courses.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                  ACE YOUR MATH PLACEMENT provides a comprehensive review of pre-algebra and elementary algebra topics that frequently appear on placement exams.
