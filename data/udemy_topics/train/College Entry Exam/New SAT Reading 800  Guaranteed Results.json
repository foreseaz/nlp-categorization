I have helped students who have tried expensive prep courses but been unable to improve on their reading - even some of my 9th grade students have scored perfectly on the SAT.</p><p>All you need to complete this course is a determination to succeed and a copy of the official practice tests from the College Board website. </p><p>Nothing gives me greater pleasure than helping my students achieve their goals. Let me help you achieve yours!</p>",
