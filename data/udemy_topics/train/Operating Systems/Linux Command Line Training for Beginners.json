    "description": "<p>In this Linux Command Line for Beginners training course, you will learn how to use the command line on a Linux system. This course is designed for the absolute beginner, meaning no previous experience with the command line is required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to provide the students with a fast and simple introduction to using the Linux command shell and some of its basic utilities.Most computer users today are only familiar with the graphical user interface (GUI) and have been taught by vendors and pundits that the command line interface (CLI) is a terrifying thing of the past. This is unfortunate, because a good command line interface is a marvellously expressive way of communicating with a computer in much the same way the written word is for human beings. It's been said that “graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible” and this is still very true today.Since Linux is modelled after the Unix family of operating systems, it shares the same rich heritage of command line tools as Unix. Unix came into prominence during the early 1980s (although it was first developed a decade earlier), before the widespread adoption of the graphical user interface and, as a result, developed an extensive command line interface instead. In fact, one of the strongest reasons early adopters of Linux chose it over, say, Windows NT was the powerful command line interface which made the “difficult tasks possible.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this Course you will start by learning about the prompt and shell interaction, then jump into learning simple commands, including how to deal with your files, run commands in the background. Then you will learn about files and directories, permissions, pipes, backgrounding, and I/O redirection. This video tutorial also covers wildcards, and how to customize aliases, your path, and your prompt. Finally, you will learn about vi, including how to navigate in vi, make changes, and save. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of using the command line on a Linux system.</p>",
