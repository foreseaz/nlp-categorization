You need to access the server through a terminal and ssh?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have no fear! You can do it!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don't fear the terminal! Whatever you can do through a graphical (S)FTP interface you can also do on the command line.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course will quickly get you up to speed on all the typical commands you will use to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Create a key pair</li><li>Connect to a remote computer</li><li>Navigate the through the directory structure</li><li>Perform file managements tasks like creating directories; copying and moving files; setting permissions on directories and files</li><li>Create and manageÂ databases and database users</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Just follow sequentially through the lectures and all of the above and more will become clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Course Structure</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each command is presented in a separate lecture to make it easy to digest and easy to find again when you want to use the course like a reference guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each command is fully demonstrated in a High Definition screen cast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Satisfaction Guarantee</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally guarantee that after you take this course you will be able to complete all the tasks you were formerly able to do only through a graphical interface. If you find that you are not able to do the things you could have otherwise done with a graphical interface, I will work one-on-one with you to help you through your challenge and will add that information to the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Click the \"Take This Course\" button now and get ready to level up your command line skills!</em></strong></p>",
