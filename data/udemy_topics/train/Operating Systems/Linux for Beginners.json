There can be so much information  available that you can't even decide where to start.  Or worse, you  start down the path of learning and quickly discover too many concepts,  commands, and nuances that aren't explained.  This kind of experience is  frustrating and leaves you with more questions than answers.  \t<em>  \t                                   Linux for Beginners</em>  doesn't make any assumptions about your background or knowledge of  Linux.  You need no prior knowledge to benefit from this course.  You will  be guided step by step using a logical and systematic approach.
