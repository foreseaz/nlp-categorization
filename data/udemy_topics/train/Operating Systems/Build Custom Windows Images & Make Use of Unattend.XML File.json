What I came up with this course is a cool, easy and professional way to make your Windows installation experience as never been before.</p>\n\n<p>This course is a <strong>mix of many features, tools, and ideas</strong> that are combined together to master custom Windows image that works on all desktops &amp; notebooks you have.</p>\n\n<p>We will create a virtual Windows machine (Windows 7, 8.1, or 10) using either Hyper-V or VirtualBox, whatever is convenient for you. Then, we will modify the image, add files to it, <strong>install applications, updates,</strong> and whatever modifications we want. Respectively we will capture that Windows machine using ImageXÂ to extract a WIM file with all these modifications.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we will see how we can use this extracted WIM file to create a bootable Windows image, moving to use an XML file that we can create to automate installing Windows almost <strong>without any user interaction.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feel like this is too advanced technical course? Don't do! We will explain every single step. <strong>No rocket science in this course, guaranteed!</strong> You will see how to do each step in a very easy and straight forward way.</p>\n\n<p>Why you are still reading here? Save your time that has been squandered doing boring tasks, hit the button <strong>\"Take this course\"</strong> and let's begin!</p>",
