I just show you the final layer result to let you understand what kind of effects I've used to achive the final result. Many people ask me about that and I've decided to reveal the process of my best shooting. It will be a light and simple course. No skills required at all. Just curiosity and I hope that could be an ispiration for you amatorial or professional work. The 80% of the shooting you will see was used for a commercial work. Every work you will see start from original layer to high end final result.</p>",
