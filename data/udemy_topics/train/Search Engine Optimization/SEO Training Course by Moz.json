Firms that practice SEO can vary; some have a highly specialized focus, while others take a more broad and general approach. Optimizing a web site for search engines can require looking at so many unique elements that many practitioners of SEO (SEOs) consider themselves to be in the broad field of website optimization (since so many of those elements intertwine).  </p>\n\n<p>  \tThis is a bit of a beginners SEO course.  <strong>To sign up for a more advanced course, visit Moz's website and check out our training and workshop offerings.</strong></p>",
