I am a believer of going against the grain, and I'll say some stuff you probably won't believe. However, with my 7 years of SEO knowledge I can assure you that my data is backed up by real case studies. This course takes you from just knowing enough about how to setup a WordPress site to scaling out your network into dozens or even hundreds of domain names to push you forward in your SERPs. I want you to succeed and I am readily available to answer any questions you have about PBNs.</p>",
