    "description": "\n\n<p>This is a Highly Focused training method very similar to <strong>Dr. Glenn Livingston's</strong> teaching in the <strong>Hyper-Responsive Marketing Course</strong>. Dr. Livingston's method (used here) allows you to research keywords without any third party software, just Google's Keyword Planner and Microsoft Excel, to draw from Google's huge database of keyword data.</p>\n\n<p>This process is called the <strong>BullsEye Keyword Research</strong> that finds the <strong>Best Keywords</strong> and Supporting Keywords for Any Market of your choice, because the data already exists, and I'll show you how to extract it from the <strong>Google Keyword Planner</strong> and massage it using Microsoft Excel formulas so you can confidently accept any offer to find those terms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Look-over-my-shoulder and watch me do this 'Live', (so to speak). This is an Actual Working Example to show how this process works. I take you step-by-step  thru what's required to use this tool. </strong></p>\n\n<p>This course <strong>DOES NOT</strong> teach Pay Per Click, but it <strong>DOES</strong> teach market research to find market intelligence to find which keywords are the best to use for any market, any niche, any time. Using the <strong>Google Keyword Planner</strong> and some <strong>Excel formulas</strong>, we will learn how to tell the difference between successful keywords and ones that have failure written all over them. <br></p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make this claim?</strong> Because I teach you how to use existing data developed by users spending millions of dollars everyday, controlled by professionals who already understand the market. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Handouts with step-by-step guidelines</strong> will hold your hand thru the whole process. Graphic handouts like flowcharts and written steps that breakdown the process so that anyone will be able to repeat this success over and over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Download the Excel files I've provided</strong> and follow the steps I teach, or just sit back and take notes to fully understand how you can attack any market of your choosing, or accept any project offered you by companies that need this done for them.</p>\n\n<p>No expensive tools to buy, no third party software that takes months to learn. If you have Microsoft Excel and have or will open a free Google account, you can learn this process. </p>\n\n<p>If you are into <strong>Affiliate Marketing</strong>, <strong>Blogging</strong>, <strong>Article Marketing</strong>, <strong>Search Engine Optimizing</strong>, <strong>Landing Page creation</strong>, <strong>Sales Page development</strong>, or <strong>Direct Mail Marketing</strong>, you will find this one of the <strong>Best tools</strong> you can have in your toolbox, either for online or off.</p>\n\n<p>This professional research method takes some time to develop, but is well worth the time and will save tons of money by not having to pay the '<strong>stupid tax</strong>' that's forced on you by any of the pay per click services that can't guide you into selecting the right keywords for your market, <strong>because they're in it to make money for themselves, not you</strong>. They'll throw keyword suggestions at you, and if you don't know better, you're bidding on keywords that hardly anyone uses, and will spend half your budget before you catch on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn ahead of time and on your own terms</strong> which keywords will work best for your application. <strong>You won't spend a dime on software or services</strong> that charge you monthly. <strong>The keywords that prove to be the Winners, are proven by the numbers, not guessing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You can repeat this process over and over and over</strong>. There are no limits to what markets you can research. <strong>You'll be able to forecast a budget</strong> to know ahead of spend, if you or the company that hires you can afford it until your marketing efforts using these keywords become successful.<br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
