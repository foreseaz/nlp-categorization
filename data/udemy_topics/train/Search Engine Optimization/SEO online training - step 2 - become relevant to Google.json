It is time to take the <strong>next SEO step</strong> with this new <strong>SEO online training</strong>. This course gives you some reward for all your SEO efforts because now it's time that Google starts to see your website as a reliable and relevant website.</p><p>This SEO training will teach you how to get a <strong>higher value</strong> or (if we can still speak of it) <strong>'pagerank'</strong> in Google. The pagerank is a score or mark that Google gives/gave websites. And the higher the score, the higher you end up in the Google search results. Google has not updated it's pagerank for some time so that's why we are not sure to still be speaking of it, but the underlying valuation process still remains.</p><p>This online SEO training provides you with <strong>SEO tools &amp; tips</strong> that can help you to beat your competition in the Google search results. <em>You get tips to make it not too complicated and keep this <strong>optimization as natural as possible </strong>so it suits your content and goal. </em></p><p>Don’t make the mistake of thinking that <em>Step by Step SEO</em> is just “another SEO” online training. Marjet’s offering stands out for many reasons, not the least of which is her passion for SEO and her ability to turn a boring, dry subject into an engrossing learning experience that includes humor and whimsy.</p><p>The illustrations that are used in this course makes a seemingly boring subject matter more fun! Getting serious stuff to people in an amusing way is one of my top goals. Marjet wants to make <strong>SEO more exciting and more tangible</strong>, so you reach your goals in small steps. <em>Step by Step SEO</em> is the brainchild of Marjet Wullink, founder of Bureau Bold, a full-service web design and development firm. Marjet’s background is in business and coding, but her strong social skills, good humor and patience make her a natural teacher.</p>",
