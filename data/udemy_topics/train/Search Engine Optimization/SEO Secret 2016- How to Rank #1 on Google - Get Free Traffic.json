As far as my experience tells me, courses and books available on the market contain a lot of unnecessary information, often not up to date. The authors boast of the fact that their courses contain 30 hours of materials. But think about the fact, how much of these information will not be useful for you. Usually it is 70-80%.</p><p>Together with my team we decided that the course \"<strong>SEO Secret 2016- How to Rank #1 on Google &amp; Get Free Traffic</strong>\" will contain only needed and useful information which actually influence the position in google thanks to <strong>Search Engine Optimisation</strong>. It has to be admitted that XXI century is a century of search engines and <strong>SEO</strong> is really important. If people are looking for something, they immediately use google. They don't think about where to find such a service or information. It is automatic process. Everything is in google, isn't it?</p><p>If your company does not have an website <strong>SEO Friendly</strong>, loses a huge amount of money. But possessing an internet site is not everything. If your website is not on the <strong>first page of google</strong> results, it is like it never existed.</p><p> The <strong>Google traffic </strong>is <strong>FREE</strong> and <strong>unlimited</strong>, but what is the most important, such traffic is also effective and generates a huge amount of revenues. The advertisements are less effective than the <strong>organic traffic</strong> from google. During the positioning you have to be cautious because if you don't know how to do it properly you can do harm to your website. Because we have bad SEO and good SEO. Google updates constantly its algorithm jut to make the manipulation of sites position to be impossible but still their algorithms poses some holes, which you will get to know during this  SEO course. You need up-to-date information about <strong>Search Engine Optimization (</strong><strong>SEO) 2016 </strong>beacuse your website has to be SEO friendly!</p><p>**************************************************************</p><p><em><strong>And the unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee is not just any old guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that you will succeed ... just like my thousands of other Udemy students.</strong></em><br></p>",
