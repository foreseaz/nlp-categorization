    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tSearch engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine&#039;s &quot;natural&quot; or un-paid (&quot;organic&quot;) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine&#039;s users.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn an age where the newest social network pops up every six months, stability is important. Whether through Facebook, Twitter, Vine, Instagram, Snapchat, or even thinking back to Myspace, seemingly gargantuan social networks seem to rise and fall in front of our eyes.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe one stable source through this shift has been Google. People will come to Google to search for websites on the Internet, and they will continue to do so for a very long time. The long-term sustainability is a huge reason by learning SEO will provide huge dividends for a long time to come.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course takes beginners through the do&#039;s and do nots of SEO. By the end of the course you will have an understanding of how SEO works as well as be able to analyze the presence of any competitors fighting for your keywords.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tGoogle’s robots that crawl the pages of the Internet need to be told what a given website is about. Done in an efficient, but not overly efficient manner, this process is called on site SEO. You are priming Google’s spiders to identify a given website as a particularly strong source of information for a given topic (a given search term).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAdditionally, Google’s spiders look to other websites to determine how valuable YOUR website is for a given search term. Off-site Search Engine Optimization occurs when you formulaically increase the perceived value of your website by increasing the strength of various websites that are linking to your website.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe last piece of the puzzle is competition analysis. Knowing the strengths of the other websites who are competing for the top search results for a given term will allow you to find their weaknesses. These tactics benefit you because it allows you to hold valuable pieces (links from a given type of website) that your competitors do not have, thus boosting your rank overall.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis FREE course discusses all of these strategies. You’ll be able to go from 0 prior SEO knowledge to being able to charge others for your SEO services!  </p>",
