style=\"\">any </strong>of the above questions then <strong style=\"\">read on </strong>because I have the answer you&#039;ve been looking for.</p><p>And I want to tell you how I stumbled upon a <em style=\"\">new source of keywords</em> that have little to <strong style=\"\">no competition</strong> and a <strong style=\"\">high volume of searches</strong>.</p><p>So these aren&#039;t micro niches with just 200-800 searches per month.</p><p>These are keywords with even 10,000 searches and basically <strong style=\"\">no competition</strong>.</p><p>And every dollar you&#039;d make from these keywords will be <strong style=\"\">pure profit</strong>.</p><p>Not to mention, it <strong style=\"\">only takes a few minutes to set everything up</strong> because these keywords have little or no competition.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Sounds too good to be true?</strong></p><p>Well read on because in a few moments I&#039;ll even reveal to you what they are.</p><p>This is like playing in a new field altogether.</p><p>I call this the <em style=\"\">Fresh SEO Arena</em>.</p><p>And if you&#039;re just tired of all the competition that&#039;s out there and all the algorithm changes then this is probably going to rock your world.</p><p>Because, I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed but…</p><strong style=\"\"> Competition Has Gone <u style=\"\">Fierce</u> </strong><p>Have you noticed how <strong style=\"\">hard</strong> it is <u style=\"\">even for seasoned marketers</u> to rank even for small niches?</p><p>They do 6 months case studies.</p><p>Even micro niches are now saturated with competition…</p><p>Just a few days ago I got an email from someone telling me how they found some micro keywords with 1000 searches but the competition still had over 10,000 backlinks.</p><p>If you search and search and search and find a few small keywords with a few searches per month and you go and spy on the competition you&#039;ll see they have thousands of backlinks and concrete SEO setup.</p><p>The competition is just massive everywhere.</p><p>All markets seem to be saturated.</p><p>I understand how <strong style=\"\">frustrating</strong> normal SEO can get.</p><p>It&#039;s one of the most frustrating part of internet marketing.</p><p>We get to this well-known but rarely admitted fact… SEO is getting harder and harder by the day.</p><p>Can&#039;t you hope for something better?</p><p>Just learning SEO is complicated enough.</p><p>But now it&#039;s all about chasing all the latest tactics and algorithm changes.</p> <strong style=\"\">This is The SEO Rat Race </strong><p>Keeping track with Algorithm changes is even more complex since there is an update every month, and major updates a few times a year that are game changers.</p><p>Let&#039;s just take a look at some of the latest algorithm changes:</p> <ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Google Hummingbird – just this one in Sept 2013 affected 90% of searches worldwide.</li><li style=\"\">Google Panda Update</li><li style=\"\">Google Penguin Update</li><li style=\"\">Google Pigeon Update</li><li style=\"\">Google Payday Update</li><li style=\"\">Google Pirate Update</li><li style=\"\">Google EMD (Exact Match Domain) Update</li><li style=\"\">Google Top Heavy Update</li></ul> <p>And if you&#039;ve been paying any attention to the SEO world you probably seen how much fuss each and every one of these updates made.</p><p>But these are just SOME of the major ones.</p><p>Actually, according to MOZ</p><p>“<em style=\"\">Each year, Google changes its search algorithm around 500–600 times</em>&quot; – MOZ</p><p>Did you get that?</p> <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">600 Algorithm Changes a Year! </strong></em><p>That means <strong style=\"\">AT LEAST once a day</strong>, if not TWICE.</p><p>Drayton Bird, a genius marketer from the UK, describes SEO as the “<em style=\"\">keyword leap frog forever</em>&quot;.</p><p>Business2Community calls the update from 21<sup style=\"\">st</sup> of April 2015 as the <strong style=\"\">Mobile Apocalypse</strong> update or <strong style=\"\">Mobilegeddon</strong> because any website that doesn&#039;t have a responsive design for mobile devices… will lose rank.</p><p>Jay Taylor from SearchEngineWatch.com says “<em style=\"\">Go mobile or become irrelevant</em>&quot;.</p><p>This is yet another major updated that probably affects 70% of websites.</p><p>Because less that 11% of the internet has a responsive web design according to a study done by GUYPO.</p><p>But this is just another major update… and there will be more and more…</p><p>Three years ago I could have said follow these 10 steps for SEO.</p><p>Today it&#039;s more like follow these 221 steps.</p><p>You&#039;re getting caught into chasing algorithm changes and tactics that don&#039;t even seem to work.</p><p>Because the competition has all the latest expensive analytics software, backlink partners and full-time staff writers.</p><p>And getting caught into this rat race will make you invest in some very expensive SEO courses…</p> A new SEO course is now being launched every day of the week. <p>Actually, if you just give a quick search on Google for “SEO Course 2015&quot; (exact match) there are currently over 17,700 search results!</p><p>For this single year alone!</p> SEO has now become a full time job. <p>I don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;ve come into internet marketing to run from my day job not to get into another one even more complicated.</p><p>And I&#039;m talking about just <u style=\"\">keeping track</u> of the algorithm changes.</p><p>Finding ways to implement the changes, correct penalizations and keep track of ranking and keywords and all that is a whole other beast.</p><p>In fact, if you purchase the latest SEO course right now that takes into account all the latest SEO changes… by this time next year that course not only will be obsolete… but will also have the potential to get your site penalized.</p><p>Yeah…</p><p>This isn&#039;t a playing ground anymore.</p><p>And it hasn&#039;t been for years.</p><p>If you aren&#039;t doing SEO full time, with employees and experts and invest in expensive software to keep track of all changes… you&#039;ll lose the game.</p><p>And it would take at least 6 months to get ranked for any <strong style=\"\">decent</strong> keyword.</p><p>Shouldn&#039;t a person demand that they are treated with respect?</p> <strong style=\"\">They Caged You Into The Big SEO Rip-Off Of The Decade </strong><p>Because there <strong style=\"\">isn&#039;t</strong> any more free traffic.</p><p>There wasn&#039;t any more free traffic for five years now.</p><p>Even if you do SEO you still pay for the traffic one way or another.</p><p>You invest in courses, you buy backlinks, articles, software, hire experts etc.</p><p>Actually, let me rephrase that because this isn&#039;t entirely true.</p><p>There is free traffic, but not going through the traditional <em style=\"\">normal</em> SEO route.</p><p>And not through the traditional internet marketing model.</p><p>But a different type of keyword targeting.</p><p>A much easier, and much lazier way.</p><p>But also, much more effective.</p> <strong style=\"\">The Old Zone vs. The Fresh SEO Arena </strong><p>In fact, this isn&#039;t about SEO, at all.</p><p>This is something I&#039;ve just basically stumbled upon by chance a couple of years ago when I got sick and tired of all the algorithm changes and wanted to try something new.</p><p>I just wanted to test a theory of mine.</p><p>And I&#039;ve been refining this ever since.</p> <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Right now there are hundreds of thousands of niches that are appearing FRESH every day… With NO competition… </strong></em><p>Ready to profit from…</p><p><strong style=\"\">If</strong> you know <strong style=\"\">how</strong>!</p><p>Many don&#039;t have a clue how to capitalize on these niches…</p><p>And these are new niches that get born, they just sort of appear out of thin air and they&#039;re getting thousands of searches.</p><p>And because they&#039;re new, they don&#039;t have any competition.</p><p>And the less competitive a keyword is… the more SEO doesn&#039;t matter…</p><p>And the less you need the latest tactics to rank for those keywords.</p><p>I&#039;ve been secretly banking big bucks by tracking down and profiting from these niches that just seem to appear out of thin air…</p><p><strong style=\"\">While the rest of the SEO world is fighting for scraps in small tiny niches that are saturated…</strong></p><p><strong style=\"\">I&#039;m on the other side in the Fresh SEO Arena, profiting and at the same time… dumb-folded why no one is doing what I&#039;m doing…</strong></p> But… to be frank, I have an unfair advantage. <p>The catch is that these aren&#039;t &#039;<em style=\"\">normal</em>&#039; niches being born.</p><p>These are <strong style=\"\">temporary</strong>.</p><p>This means that after some time they also disappear.</p><p>These temporary niches last anywhere from a few days, maybe a few weeks and some even as low as a few hours.</p><p>But it doesn&#039;t matter, because thousands of new ones are being born every day, and if you&#039;re quick to catch them, you just go in, get the money and get out.</p><p>And all this happens fast because there isn&#039;t any competition you can easily set everything up in maybe 30 minutes and rank within a day, not months.</p><p>But these temporary niches seem so obscure that <strong style=\"\">no one has <em style=\"\">any </em>clue</strong> how to monetize them.</p><p>But I have crafted and refined my method of doing this.</p><p>And it works!</p><p>Actually, I have my own formula for finding and profiting from temporary niches called…</p> <strong style=\"\">Temporary Niches Formula </strong><p>And I&#039;ve put it all together into a step-by-step video course for you.</p><p>I&#039;ve eliminated all the fluff and condensed everything into just an hour.</p><p>The formula and the step by step plan.</p><p>No fluff and NO B.S.</p><p>Just the raw information and system you need to profit in the Fresh SEO Arena.</p><p>Don&#039;t let the length of this video course fool you.</p><p>Hours and hours of research and tests have gone into the creation of this formula.</p><p>You&#039;ll be shocked to find that everything can be done in just 8 steps.</p><p>No theory.</p><p>No B.S.</p> <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Just 8 steps and profit </strong></em><p>No one knows how to monetize these keywords, but using my formula you will know.</p><p>I&#039;ll give you several resources to find temporary niches and in just 10 to 15 minutes you will find dozens of niche ready for you to profit from.</p><p>Just in the process of creating the videos for this product I&#039;ve discovered a few niches with 10,000 searches and one even with 200,000 searches.</p><p> The keywords don&#039;t even matter because at this time, these niches are already dead.</p><p>The niche had an explosive traffic then it all died out.</p><p>And there are thousands of these niches appearing and disappearing every single day.</p> You just need to catch them while they&#039;re climbing in popularity and profit from them <p>It&#039;s just a simple process of discovering them, profiting from them and moving on to another one.</p><p>In essence, that&#039;s the formula.</p> <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Get In – Get The Money – Get Out </strong></em><p>And in my course I&#039;ll show you every step of the way how you can do this.</p><p>You may think that it&#039;s too good to be true and that there is a catch.</p><p>Why don&#039;t I just keep making money, never revealing the secret?</p><p><strong style=\"\">Because there really <u style=\"\">is a catch</u>.</strong></p><p>Like I mentioned, these are TEMPORARY niches, meaning you need to keep going after new ones to keep making money.</p><p>And you will get bored of it even if you&#039;re making money.</p><p>At least I did.</p><p>But I still go after some temporary niches every few months whenever I need some quick cash.</p><p>As cheesy as this may sound... </p> This is like Turning the Internet Into Your Personal ATM <p>It takes just a few minutes to setup these sites.</p><p>They contain lazy SEO because there is no competition and you just need to do <strong style=\"\">minimal work</strong> to get ranked in these temporary niches.</p><p>It works.</p><p>Are
