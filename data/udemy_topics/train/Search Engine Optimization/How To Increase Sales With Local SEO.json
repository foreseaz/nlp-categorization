The course blueprint includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Section 1 Introduction to Local SEO</li><li>Section 2 Getting Started - Claiming your business listing with Google My Business</li><li>Section 3 Creating local citations - understanding NAP (Name Address Phone#)</li><li>Section 4 The importance of customer reviews</li><li>Section 5 Introduction to Keyword Research</li><li>Section 6 Website Optimization</li><li>Section 7 Link Building Primer</li><li>Section 8 Email Marketing - Keeping in touch with your customers</li><li>Section 9 Conclusion </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Local SEO?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing Local SEO with Traditional SEO, the overall process is similar, the major difference is that Local is based on location or a specific area, while traditional is not. For example, if you have a tennis racket shop in Tampa, FL, you are most likely trying to reach a customer base that is in and around the Tampa (and possibly St. Petersburg) area, but that is it. This reduces your marketing area and allows you to concentrate on the local Tampa area allowing you to be more focused and targeted. </p>",
