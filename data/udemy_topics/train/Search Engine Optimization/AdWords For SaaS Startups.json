    "description": "<p>Many startups still believe marketing is a dirty word…</p>  <p>  \t                    But while there are examples of “bad\" companies who've used marketing to edge out better alternatives...  </p>  <p>  \t                There are also lots of respected companies who know a solid marketing plan is one of the most important parts of creating significant user growth.  </p>  <p>  \t                    As Fog Creek put it:  </p>  <p>  \t<em>“Marketing isn't about scamming or duping people. It's about communicating to people what they want.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em>Engineers often treat marketing like it is black magic, but really, it comes down to making sure the people whose lives you are aiming to improve with your software actually hear about you.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em>If they don't hear about you, they'll be stuck using whatever duct-taped together work-around they are forced to use in the absence of your software. That isn't good for them and it isn't good for your company.\"</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                    They're not alone in their assessment, either.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Neil Patel (KISSMetrics, Crazy Egg, QuickSprout) says:  </p>  <p>  \t<em>“The number one mistake you can make when it comes to marketing is not doing it. People aren't going to learn about your great product unless you tell them.\"</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                    Marc Andreeson (Mosaic, Netscape, Andreessen Horowitz ) notes:  </p>  <p>  \t<em>“The press focus on the rare companies like Instagram who build super quickly. But most startups don't have that kind of amazing story.\"</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                    And Chris Dixon (Andreessen Horowitz, SiteAdvisor, Hunch) instructs:  </p>  <p>  \t<em>“Most people do not automatically adopt the best product. Any company that's successful over a long period of time has a MASSIVE sales and marketing effort behind it. If you marry a great product to a great sales and marketing strategy, the world is your oyster.\"</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                    If you still don't think your startup needs effective marketing to succeed in today's competitive landscape, you may as well click your “back\" button and move on.  </p>  <p>  \t                    On the other hand, if you want to figure out a highly effective way to get users for your SaaS product, you're probably saying:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>“Okay, I Get It. Marketing's Good.   \t                   Now How The Hell Do I Make It Happen?\"</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                    Good question. Here's our take on it:  </p>  <p>  \t                    First, there's no “wrong\" way to grow your user base. Many respected entrepreneurs have taken different paths to success.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But in our opinion, some ways are definitely easier than others.  </p>  <p>  \t                    As you can see from the “sidebar\" to the left, we've had a lot of experience working with SaaS startups and have seen (and tried) many different marketing tactics.  </p>  <p>  \t                    We've worked with display advertising, social media, press releases, industry conventions, webinars, blogging, and many more…  </p>  <p>  \t                    And for our money, you can't beat Google AdWords to quickly, accurately, and effectively grow your SaaS business.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Now, you might be thinking:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>“Wait A Minute...   \t                   Can't You Lose Your   \t                   Shirt With AdWords?!\"</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                    We can understand why you'd think so.  </p>  <p>  \t                    There are tons of horror stories of business owners spending their entire month's budget in a few hours, having Google ban their account, or even just giving up after one look at the (admittedly terrible) AdWords interface.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But as people who've spent millions of dollars advertising on AdWords – and created an exceptional ROI – we believe AdWords represents the best marketing opportunity for any growing SaaS company.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Our beta testers over the last 1.25 years agree, too.  </p>  <p>  \t<em>\"Great AdWords course! It's comprehensive and well done, so you'll avoid a ton of expensive mistakes that newer advertisers (and even many veterans!) consistently make. Wish I'd had this sooner... would have saved me a ton of frustration and money.\"</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                    - Dan Putt, AdWords user since 2004  </p>  <p>  \t<em>\"This course is awesome for AdWords beginners. It's clear not only what you need to do, but HOW to do it. All you have to do is just follow along… I'm amazed they could simplify such a complex topic into straight forward action steps. And the videos are short enough where it's not torture, which is nice, too.</em>\"  </p>  <p>  \t                    - Karen Waksman, Retail MBA  </p>  <p>  \t                    Don't get us wrong…  </p>  <p>  \t                    If you don't have any customers – or don't even have a product – AdWords isn't for you.  </p>  <p>  \t                    While it can quickly turn a struggling SaaS startup into a successful one, you do need to have ironed out the kinks in the development and delivery of your product.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But once you're off the ground, a successful AdWords campaign can grow your business very quickly.  </p>  <p>  \t                    In fact, for our money, there's no better way to scale your marketing. Once you've dialed in your campaigns, you can dramatically increase your marketing reach with a few clicks.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Even better, you DON'T need a huge budget to get started with AdWords. Even $5 a day can dramatically increase your user base.  And once you've got it bringing in a positive ROI, scaling can be as simple as clicking a few buttons (literally).  </p>  <p>  \t                    Of course, we'd be lying if we said you didn't need to know a few “tricks\" to be successful with AdWords. That's why we've put together this course.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Inside This Course, </strong> <strong>  \t                   You'll Learn Little Tricks Like…</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>How to get into the head of your customers and know them better than they know themselves.

Obviously a lot of time and effort has been put into creating this course, and we believe in fair compensation.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Frankly, we firmly believe you won't find this level of AdWords mastery anywhere else on Udemy – or the entire internet, for that matter.  </p>  <p>  \t                    And if you're serious about accelerating your revenue and user growth, you really can't go past this course.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But why not shift gears for a second, and ask yourself:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>What Will It Cost You   \t                   To NOT Give This Course A Try?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                    Everything in life has a cost. If it's not money, it's time, lost opportunity, or some other resource. Sure, if you tackle AdWords without this course, it's a good bet you'll lose money. And there's no guarantee you'll ever figure out how to turn that situation around.  </p>  <p>  \t                    After all, unlike a lot of pieces of a business, there's no free tutorials on AdWords available online… At least, not any that goes into the level of depth we do, and not any that will get you successfully using AdWords so quickly.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But let's imagine you want to sidestep AdWords altogether and focus on another form of marketing. First of all, you've got to spend time learning and implementing it. And while other methods might prove successful, like we said, we've tried 'em all – and nothing compares to the speed and efficiency of AdWords.  </p>  <p>  \t                    So, ask yourself…  </p>  <p>  \t                    How much time and energy are you willing to take away from the things you SHOULD be doing – like growing your user base or iterating your product – trying to research the best marketing option and expose all the ins and outs?  </p>  <p>  \t                    Probably not the best use of your time, right?  </p>  <p>  \t                    On the other hand, you could pay a marketing agency…  </p>  <p>  \t                    But while there are a few good ones, most will overcharge you and deliver substandard work that either leaves your user base exactly where it was…  </p>  <p>  \t                    Or worse, alienates your customers and sucks the growth out of your startup.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Finally, you could try to implement a “growth hacking\" strategy like asking users to invite friends or family.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Unfortunately, these “solutions\" don't do much to grow your user base. While word of mouth is great, it will never replace a powerful marketing strategy for sheer speed and quality of user growth.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Needless to say, we think this course is by far the best investment of time and money you can make...  </p>  <p>  \t                    But we don't expect you to simply take our word for it.  </p>  <p>  \t                    We believe you should have the opportunity to try AdWords for SaaS Startups without committing to whether it's worth the sticker price or not, and Udemy agrees.  </p>  <p>  \t                    That's why you get a full…  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>30-Day, 100% Money Back Guarantee</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                    If you don't love the course, or if your business isn't growing like you hoped, no problem.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Just let Udemy know and they'll refund every cent you paid. No harm, no foul.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Ultimately, there are two ways taking us up on this generous offer can pan out for you.  </p>  <p>  \t                    On one hand, you could finally understand how to use Google Adwords to grow your user base quickly, consistently, and at a healthy ROI.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Cash flow will improve… resources will be freed up for further testing, tweaking, and implementing… and high-value doors will open for you.  </p>  <p>  \t                    OR… you're back right where you are now… without being a single cent out of pocket.  </p>  <p>  \t                    We think that's a fair deal…  </p>  <p>  \t                    In fact, we think it's more than fair…  </p>  <p>  \t                    We think you'd have to be crazy to pass us up on it.  </p>  <p>  \t                    And if you agree with us, we hope we'll see you inside the training area.  </p>  <p>  \t                    -Mike Williams and Juan Martitegui  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>P.S...</strong>  </p><p>We've advised startups across the globe… so we know a thing or two about how to get your SaaS business adding users at a lightning-fast rate.</p><p>So if you're interested in growing your SaaS business, we highly recommend you jump on this opportunity now, rather than later.    </p><p>  \t                    Remember, with the 100% money-back guarantee, there's literally NO risk to you.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Either your startup kicks into high gear and you vault over your obstacles, or you don't pay a cent (but you keep the knowledge you've gained along the way).  </p>  <p>  \t                    Sign up now and we'll see you inside.  </p>",
