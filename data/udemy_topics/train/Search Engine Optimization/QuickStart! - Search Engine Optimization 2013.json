    "description": "<p>  \t This VTC QuickStart! course on Search Engine Optimization is designed to focus on two areas: On-Page and Off-Page Optimization. Author Mark Struthers begins by discussing what SEO is before moving on to evaluating an existing website to gauge what can be done to improve its search engine page rank. Similar sites are also examined to generate ideas for keywords and meta tags that might optimize our site. Internet tools such as Google Toolbar, Google Keyword Tool, Google Analytics, and Google AdWords are discussed prior to looking at sitemaps and other On-Page tags. The course concludes with a look at the emergence of social media as another SEO tool. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>",
