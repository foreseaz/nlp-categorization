    "description": "<p>If you want to earn money with apps, your apps need to be found. For that to happen, you need to be really good at App Store Optimization, there is no way around that.</p><p>App Store Optimization (ASO) is basically the process of changing and optimizing a mobile app's metadata (like the title, description, icon, etc.) in order to rank higher in search results, which leads to an increase in organic downloads. Learning ASO can quickly change the amount of passive revenue an app generates for you and can be the difference between <em>freeing up some of your time and allow you to focus on things that are important to you</em> vs struggling to get downloads after you worked hard to get your app ready. It really doesn't matter how great your app is, if people cannot find it they will not download it. You need to make it easy for your potential users to find your app. And the great news is that it really isn't an overly complicated process, it is <em><strong>completely free</strong></em> and actually <em><strong>quite simple</strong></em> once you get used to it and start applying it constantly.</p><p>There are roughly 1.5 million apps on each the iOS App Store and Google Play so it is easy for your app to get lost among them. There are so many developers that spend time, energy, and money developing an app, but when they upload it the returns are nowhere near what they were expecting. This is because they focus their time and energy in building the app, but not in optimizing it to be found. What if I told you that there is a way to <em>avoid your app getting lost among the huge pool of apps in the app stores</em>? What if I told you that you <em>don't actually need to spend a lot of time and effort on ASO</em> once you know how to do it? Would you be interested in learning about it?</p><p><strong>Well, if you are then look no further – This course is the introduction to ASO you are looking for!</strong></p><p>This course is straight to the point and will provide you everything you need, no beating around the bush or repeating the same thing with different words. There is a tonne of things to learn about ASO, and they always keep changing as people try new things and the rules in the app stores change. It is a process that you will need to keep learning for as long as you are uploading apps, if you see a course that tells you they will teach you everything there is about ASO don't believe it because <em>it is not possible</em>. So, this course will not teach you everything there is about ASO, but it is a <em><strong>great quick start guide for everyone with no prior ASO experience</strong></em>. With an average of <em>4.96 stars provided by over 25 ratings </em>you can be confident that the content you are getting is first class. In 1.5 quality packed hours you will fully understand ASO and the mindset that the most successful optimization experts have. It is a great way to start your journey towards more downloads and ultimately <em>more money</em>. </p><p>If you are someone with <em>no prior ASO experience</em> then this is definitely the course for you. If you, however, have reasonable knowledge of ASO then this introductory course is probably not what you are looking for.</p><p>How can I be so sure? Well, I have an app business on the side that <em>generates roughly $6,000 of monthly income</em> and I teach another, longer course where I go through the steps to create a profitable app business. There is no way to achieve that without ASO, it is absolutely crucial. But don't just listen to me, listen to what some of the others students in the course have said:</p><p>“This is a great little course! I had no idea about ASO, I only make apps as a hobby. But after applying what I learnt here I got a great increase in downloads and made more money. I'm thinking now of taking my hobby a bit more serious now that I see the potential. I recommend this course if you want to get started with ASO.\"</p><p>- <em>Tadros Hadad</em>, 5/5 Stars</p><p>“Very enlightening. I took another aso course before but I didn't really like the way it was taught and I just felt the instructor repeated himself a lot. Diego, the instructor in this course, has made a great quick start guide that is nothing like that other course I took. I finished this course in a couple of hours and 10 minutes later I was already optimizing my apps. I loved this course, definitely get it if you want a great place to get started\"</p><p>- <em>Sarah Feng</em>, 5/5 Stars</p><p>\"Very interesting course. I previously wasn't doing much ASO but have been doing so recently after this course and have seen a 25% increase in downloads. Thanks Diego!\"</p><p>- <em>Max William</em>, 5/5 Stars</p><p>Some of the things you will learn in this course are:</p> <ol><li>Research your competition using App Annie, a free online resource</li> <li>Design your icons to engage potential users</li> <li>Your preview screenshots and video, they are more important than you think!</li> <li>Optimize your titles for searches and have your apps rank higher</li> <li>What keywords should you choose and why, especially in the iOS App Store</li> <li>Convince potential users to take action with your description</li> <li>Optimize your description to rank higher in Google Play</li> <li>Get more positive reviews, they are crucial!</li> <li>Other factors that affect your app's ranking in searches</li> <li>Where to go after you finish the course</li> <li><em><em>Bonus</em>: A great coupon discount to my other very successful course on earning a passive monthly income with an app business on the side.</em></li></ol> <p>And this is just a sample of some of the things you will get from this introductory course, by the end you will have <em>everything you need to get started</em> and a very good idea of where to go to keep improving your optimization abilities.</p><p>No matter who you are, if you know how to program or not, if you build your own apps or have someone else build them for you, if you are a student or a professional, what you learn here will increase your apps' success.</p><p>I am very passionate about teaching and <strong><em>I will personally respond to any questions you may have as you go through the course</em></strong>.
