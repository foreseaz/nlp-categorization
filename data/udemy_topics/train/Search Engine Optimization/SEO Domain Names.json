    "description": "<p>  \t    To maximize your search engine-referred traffic, it is important to locate and secure SEO friendly domain names which accurately describe your products and services.  </p>  <p>  \t    Ideally, you should strike a balance between finding a catchy, unique, brand-friendly domain name and having a domain that contains keywords your business is trying to target. The benefit of a keyword-rich domain is two-fold. First, the domain name itself is a ranking factor that the engines consider when calculating ranking order.  </p>  <p>  \t  Second, having relevant keywords in a domain name is beneficial because the domain name is the text that other Internet users will use as anchor text when linking. Since keywords in anchor text are an important ranking factor, having these keywords in a domain name can have a positive impact on ranking.  </p>  <p>  \t    This course teaches you how to expertly locate and deploy SEO friendly domain names <strong>so join us today</strong>!  </p>",
