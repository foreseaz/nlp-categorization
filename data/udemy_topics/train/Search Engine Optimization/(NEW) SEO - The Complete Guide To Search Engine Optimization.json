They keep saying that they will quit their jobs and start their dream job online. The problem is that most people only go as far as learning the very basics about internet marketing and when they finally decide to get started, they fail to see any results that will encourage them to continue moving forward with it. </p><p><strong>Over 95% of individuals who try to succeed with internet marketing are going to quit within 30 to 90 days and that is a proven fact!</strong></p><p>The reason why this happens is quite simple. The first mistake that people make is to think that making money online is going to be a walk in the park. There is no way to earn a lot of money online in a legal way that will pay you thousands of dollars for a few days of work. You need to learn how the internet works and how successful internet marketers earn their income.</p><p><strong>The secret to success is search engine optimization!</strong></p><p>Most people who have attempted to get involved in the business of internet marketing have heard of SEO, but very few people have given it the attention that it deserves. You could have the best products or the most affordable services, but if you don't know how optimize your content for search engines, you are never going to be able to make full time income from the internet. </p><p>It doesn't really matter if you want to use the internet to promote an existing business, or to start earning money from affiliate marketing and pay per click. It could also be to raise awareness for an important cause on a website. All of those things require traffic to be able to generate income. That traffic needs to be targeted to your particular niche of business and then you will have a potential customer in your hands.</p><p>This is the one thing that most people are failing to see. They create social media pages, open up a website and post a few links to their Facebook contacts a couple of times a week and they feel like this should be enough for them to see results. Things don't work that way and you will have to learn to perform proper SEO in order to see those results. </p><p><strong>My Udemy SEO course us going to allow you to learn everything there is to know in order to succeed online!</strong></p><p>Remember that I said that the main ingredient for online success is search engine optimization. This is 100% accurate because without it, you would have no way to gain visitors.</p><p>The beauty of SEO is that you can use it for all kinds of purposes and it can become a huge assest and it will be extremely useful at all times in the modern world. </p><p>These are some of the skills you will gain from this course:</p><ul><li><em>Perform efficient keyword research</em></li> <li><em>Rank a Website high in the organic search</em></li> <li><em>Learn to build links</em></li> <li><em>WordPress SEO</em></li> <li><em>Creating quality content</em></li> <li><em>How to use analytics</em></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Take this amazing and extremely valuable course for just $197!</strong></p><p><em>Here are some review from students currently taking the course:</em></p><p><strong>Irfan Setiawan</strong> - <em>U</em><em>ou taught me many things about SEO.</em></p><p><strong>Noah Christian</strong> -<em> </em><em>English Accent - Check!
