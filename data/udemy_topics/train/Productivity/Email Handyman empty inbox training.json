    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>Why Email workshops?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Email is known as the &quot;killer application&quot; of the last 15 years. Yet more and more organisations and managers are struggling with the impact of email on day-to-day work. When it comes to productivity, Email might as well be known as the &quot;serial killer application&quot;. It has become our single most important business tool yet we pay little attention how to properly use, and not use, email. We believe this is a shame, as everyone spends increasing time on email and teaching yourself some basic principles can save you valuable hours every week.  </p>  <p>  \t      Email Handyman specializes in short yet powerful workshops to make your use of email more effective. Consider the following achievable benefits:  </p>  <p>  \t      - An <strong>empty inbox</strong> every single day<br>  \t       - Have more <strong>control</strong> over your tasks and commitments<br>  \t       - Being able to <strong>trust</strong> that you are not overlooking things<br>  \t       - Have <strong>peace of mind</strong> so you can make better decisions and spend more time on important tasks<br>  \t       - Be <strong>quicker</strong> (and thus spend less time) on email  </p>",
