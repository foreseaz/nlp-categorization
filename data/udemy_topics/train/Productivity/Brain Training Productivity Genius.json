Geniuses are people who encourage certain processes in their mind. Ultimately, they <em>create time and space for richer mental connections to form.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                                    Look at Einstein's brain, and you'll see that his brain wasn't any bigger than yours or mine, but it had more neural connections than average. Some areas of his brain packed more punch because of how he used his mind, his thoughts, and his imagination.  </p>  <p>  \t                                    He wasn't born that way either. <strong>Genius thinking increases your intelligence to problem solve, create, focus, and perceive. </strong><em>These are the keys to transforming life (and the world!) from the inside out.</em> That's where your brain training comes in.  </p>  <p>  \t                        With this concise course to productive brain training you:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><em>Gain mental clarity in work and      play</em></li>  \t<li><em>Reduce stress and remove      self-doubt</em></li>  \t<li><em>See a number of possibilities      where most people only see one</em></li>  \t<li><em>Connect with your deep      intuitive knowledge</em></li>  \t<li><em>Exercise mental mastery in      real-life scenarios</em></li>  \t<li><em>Advance your mind in the      directions you choose</em> (from physics, patents, parenting, writing your book, teaching a course,  academic excellence, skill building, life hacking, world peace,  autodidactic titillation, character development, to developing apps or  building your business... You decide.)</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t                                    To rise above overwhelming \"uh-oh's\", and start getting <strong>on demand epiphanies</strong>, you only need 11 minutes a day for the technique plus 11 minutes for review for a minimum of 11 days.  </p>  <p>  \t<em>You could easily spend $1,000's of dollars</em> searching for solutions... or you can <strong></strong>get right to the heart of the matter in this<strong><em> laser-focused course.</em></strong><br>  \t<br>  \t                                     Genius problem-solving and creativity is not restricted from you. Genius thinking is yours if you're daring enough to:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Embrace your potential</li>  \t<li>Seize your passion</li>  \t<li>Trust your self</li>  \t<li>Think bigger</li>  \t<li>And overcome obstacles in a      bold way. </li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>In just a few hours</strong>, you will be thinking in extraordinary, new ways with simple, but wildly effective brain training.  </p>  <p>  \t                                    I understand if you think maybe it works for some people... but I personally guarantee this course will eliminate your self-doubt.
