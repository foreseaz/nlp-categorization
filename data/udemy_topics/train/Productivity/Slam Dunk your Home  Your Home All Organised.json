However, simply giving you a recipe for getting organised and not addressing &#039;why&#039; you may be struggling to create order in your home, will not help you in the long-run.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t As a professional organiser, I focus a great deal on why a person is disorganised before I even look at their space. As such this course will combine some introspection with lots of practical tips and ideas to organise your home.  </p>",
