    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Up to-date I have hired and fired over 500 outsourced employees.  Through this experience I have really learned what to expect, and what a person doesn't want when looking for employees.  I have spent thousands doing this and failing but all for a good reason.  I wanted to master it, and I did just that.  I have hired 30-+ employees without a bad one in  the bunch, and I'm here to show you some of my secrets.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  What would you do if I told you with the right formula you can replace yourself over and over until you had a snowball of money coming your way.  Our goal in this is to give you all of the tools to create a snowball effect of money and then just feed that snowball till it becomes avalanche.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In this course you will learn everything you need to become a successful entrepreneur outsourcing your teams and making money with no work.  </p>",
