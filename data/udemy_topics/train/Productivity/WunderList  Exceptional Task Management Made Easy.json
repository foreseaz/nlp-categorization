This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn&#039;t aware of.&quot; </em></li>  \t<em style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">&quot;The Best Teacher ever, who make you understand the in &amp; out Music Theory by all mean without giving what you don&#039;t want to know.&quot;</li>  \t<li style=\"\">&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;</li>  \t</em></em></em>  </ul>",
