    "description": "Most people plan for what&#039;s going to happen to their physical things when they die, but few people think about what happens to all of their digital content. This not only includes the files that reside on their computer, but also what exists in the cloud and on social media sites. All of their photos, comments, likes, music, etc. You may or may not want family and friends to have continued access to it, but because of privacy policies, unless you have made arrangements before your passing, any access that you might want them to have may be denied. This course will identify several aspects that you need to consider and plan for in order to prepare your &quot;digital afterlife.&quot;",
