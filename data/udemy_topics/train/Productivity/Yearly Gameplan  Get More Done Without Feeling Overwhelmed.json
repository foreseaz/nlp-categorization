    "description": "<p><strong>Course fully updated on JuneÂ 2016.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learn how to make daily progress towards your goals in 5 steps!<br></p>\n\n<p>But first, a few questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do you often find yourself setting new years resolutions or goals that never happen?</li><li>Are you frustrated in having to start over every single time?</li><li>Do you feel like you lack the motivation or time to work on what you love?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Don't worry, I totally understand how you feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my goals two years ago was making and releasing an online course. The problem was I had no idea where to start and i was trying to balance that with parenthood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">It was frustrating and I felt like i had no direction.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">When I learned a simple method to help me create clear goals that I can do to consistently.</strong> I practically woke up everyday motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the need to feel like you need to do everything. In reality, if you do simple steps day by day, you'll achieve what you set out to do. It may feel like you're not doing much at first, but it's the small steps that lead to the big victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">My philosophy is simple: simplicity and consistency breeds success.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've had the pleasure of implementing these same steps with my dance crew which has been going strong for 11 years and has won multiple championships, my clients in where they lost 20-40 pounds of weight, my business in earning thousands of dollars, and my personal life where I learned how to balance working at home and building a family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I go into the details of my course, let's take a look at your options</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Seminar/Workshop </strong>- These are great because you really get to dive in and immerse yourself with likeminded people and learn from the best minds out there. The problem is, what if you don't have the time or the money to commit to this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Hire a coach</strong> - A lot of coaches can cost from $300-$2,500 an hour. If you can afford this, I recommend you go for it. If not, let's take a look at your next option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn for free on YouTube</strong> - There's a lot of free information out there to help you get started in helping you set goals and action steps. But do you really want to spend hours and hours looking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"Off the bat, I could probably write a long essay about how Emeroy Bernardo's teachings have positively influenced my life. That's what Roy does as a coach, he gives advice that can help changeone's life. Whether he is a coach for health, fitness, dance, etc. Roy can always find an inspiring quote or motto to help motivate you. He does not only coach verbally. He \"walks the talk.\" Roy is a physical example that \"actions speak louder than words.\" He stays healthy, dances his heart out, lives life to the fullest, and remains respectful to those around him. I call him \"Coach Guru\" because he is the perfect balance of being a motivational coach while including how to stay relaxed.\" </em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">-Jazlynn Pastor</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In my course, Yearly Gameplan, I take you through 5 steps in how to create clarity for your personal goals so you can create a weekly, monthly, or yearly game plan. </strong>A course designed for people like you who are frustrated in starting over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Let's take a quick look at these steps:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Creating A Powerful Vision. </strong>Without clarity of what you want in your life, you're not going to accomplish much.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Wheel of Life.</strong> There's more to life than to work.
