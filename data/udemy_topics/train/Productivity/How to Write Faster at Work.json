In this course, you&#039;ll get more than a dozen strategies that I&#039;ve used to author two full-length books, blog five days a week, create a weekly e-newsletter, and teach 50 webinars and workshops a year, most with bonus handouts. People assume we have a huge staff of writers  -- but it&#039;s just one other person and me. We consistently churn out great content that people love, and you can too! Just follow the system shared in this course.  </p>",
