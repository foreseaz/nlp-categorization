I also cover some of the most common errors people make when establishing their goals and I provide a bonus lecture on time management. Last, at the end of the course I give you the opportunity to answer a question to win a free course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topics in the course include, but are not limited to;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The difference between a vision, goal or resolution. </strong></li><li><strong>When setting specific goals can be a bad thing. </strong></li><li><strong>Why I use </strong><em><strong>Actionable</strong></em><strong> instead of <em>Achievable</em>.</strong></li><li><strong>The importance of Action/Feedback loops. </strong></li><li><strong>How to juggle multiple goals at the same time.</strong> </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is now my <strong>6th course</strong> on Udemy, so when you enroll you also get access to my announcements that include free tips, hacks and techniques on productivity, innovation, motivation and problem-solving.
