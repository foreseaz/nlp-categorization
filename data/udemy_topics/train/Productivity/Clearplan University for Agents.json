    "description": "<p>Clearplan University for Agents will help you to learn the Clearplan application so you can become a better recovery agent. Stop carrying paper everywhere. Lose the pen to write updates. Stop calling the office to see if the account is still open. Simply search in CP to see if the account is open. Stop running accounts that are already discounted or recovered, you're just wasting time and costing yourself money. Stop stepping on each otherâ€™s toes. Streamline communication within your team. Clearplan helps you do all of this while molding around the way your company runs.</p><p>We have no doubt that when implemented correctly you will see nothing but more units and higher recovery rates than ever before.  Service to our clients is top priority and it's what gets us \"more work\" or \"higher volume,\" before Clearplan we were having to remember all these addresses.  The issue is that one of these addresses may very well have a unit in the driveway and with everything we are committing to memory ,it's easy to forget.  Nothing looks worse in the clients eyes, but thats all about to change.</p><p><span></span>One on of the key issues in our industry is there has never been an industry vetted tool for repossession logistics, until Clearplan.  Clearplan was built with 30 years of industry knowledge with founders that actually still run a truck at night.  This personal dedication to always being the best and ahead of the curve, along with the support of almost 6,000 users is why Clearplan is the only choice for repossession logistics. Finally a system that your admins and office staff can use to speak with our agents in the field getting new addresses and important account info into the field, in real time with no refreshing. Clearplan was built by repo guys, for repo guys.</p>",
