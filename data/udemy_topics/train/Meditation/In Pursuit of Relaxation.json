    "description": "<p>  \t        This course is about the signs and effects of stress and how to encourage the body to relax more frequently. We&#039;ll primarily look at Harvard cardiologist Herbert Benson&#039;s concept of the Relaxation Response, which is our body&#039;s own parasympathetic nervous system in action.  </p>  <p>  \t        You&#039;ll learn how reducing stress can support your body to have better health and well-being now and to avoid the consequences of chronic stress down the road.  </p>  <p>  \t        This course is particularly good for:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Those who find themselves regularly overloaded with information</li>  \t<li>Those who have trouble taking regular breaks</li>  \t<li>Those who are goal-oriented and find deep rest difficult to achieve</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t        The course will take approximately a half hour to complete, and can be watched in one sitting, or in separate pieces if you prefer.  </p>  <p>  \t        The course is structured into three sections, first focusing on why our body responds the way that it does to stress, then on the relaxation response, and finally on recommendations for including relaxation techniques into your own life.  </p>",
