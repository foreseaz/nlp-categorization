    "description": "<p>Just as we brush our teeth everyday to clean the residual gunk out, daily meditation has the same effect on the mind; it clears away the chatter. Yogiraj Alan Finger has been teaching yoga and meditation for over 50 years and is honored to offer his sacred meditation tools to create transformation and inspiration into everyday living. In this 60 minute course learn pre-meditative asana (poses) to prepare the body, pranayama (breathing techniques) to help draw the senses inward and visualizations to help focus the mind. These techniques will be followed by 18-minutes of stillness which will allow the practitioner to tune into the true Self. The practice will conclude with a series of mantras (chants) to help to reground the energy and bring the experience of Oneness into each moment of your living.</p>\r\n",
