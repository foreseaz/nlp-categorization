    "description": "<p>This course demystifies meditation and makes it easy for anyone and everyone! </p><p>It is perfect for people who have tried meditation but were intimidated or thought it was too difficult.  This class will jump-start your practice with ten easy-to-follow guided meditations so that you can find the one that works best for you.</p><p>The course is designed so that you watch the first three introductory videos explaining what meditation is and how it works and then possibly try the first 5 minute \"Pretending to meditate\" meditation just so you experience what it is like to sit still for 5 minutes.  Then it is best to try one meditation per day for the next 9 days sequentially.  Each meditation uses a different technique and each one is one minute longer than the previous meditation to help you gently build up endurance.</p><p> I have been teaching meditation all over America for many years and I lead highly acclaimed sold-out workshops at the Esalen Institute and many yoga studios.<br></p><p>I've been practicing yoga and meditation for 25 years and have graduate degrees in Psychology, Philosophy, and Religious Studies. </p><p> I'm a Licensed Psychotherapist and Licensed Counselor and advocate meditation for all of my patients. </p>",
