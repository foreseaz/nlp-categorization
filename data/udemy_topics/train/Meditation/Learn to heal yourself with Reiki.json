    "description": "<p>This course is about self-healing with Reiki. Reiki is a natural form of healing. It is also an adjunct to Western Medicine. That is, you can use Reiki to ease pain and suffering, as well as to promote a sense of wellbeing. I will be referring to terms such as auras and chakras. Useful but optional tools include candles, crystals and gemstones. I will refer to them later in the course. This course will probably take about a week or two to complete. Topics include an overview of Reiki, sensing energy, auras, chakras, basic hand positions, distance/absent healing and using tools such as crystals, gemstones and candles. Note: the emphasis here is on self-healing. A disadvantage of teaching online courses is the lack of face to face interaction. Perhaps placing the emphasis on self-healing is a way to work around the obstacle. I believe one is only effective as a healer as he or she is healthy. If you wish to find out ways to help yourself feel better naturally, please consider taking this course.</p>",
