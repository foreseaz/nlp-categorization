    "description": "<p>  \t <em style=\"\">Quick Meditation </em>provides a basic overview of meditation along with a daily practice that anyone can do.  </p>  <p>  \t The core concepts of meditation are exceedingly simple and  starting a daily practice is easy; yet, the change that can take place  in the practitioner is amazing. This course is for anyone who feels that  they have no time for meditation, but sure could use the benefits of a  regular practice.  </p>  <p>  \t The course consists of two primary sections that are comprised  of short video lectures. The first section is a brief introduction to  the concepts, and the second outlines the practice.  The course only  takes about 30 minutes.  </p>",
