As such it is not meant for the student to actually start studying the technic of Qi Gong in its details (but this will be the subject of other courses I put on UDEMY though). </p><p> \t <strong>The course includes</strong> 5 downloadable PDF documents and <strong>9</strong> videos </p> <ul><strong></strong><li><strong>5 </strong>\"explanation\" </li><li><strong>4</strong> \"actual demonstrations\" with some voice comments in the back ground</li></ul>  <ul><li><strong>in the PDF</strong> documents, I tend to be more academic<strong></strong></li><li><strong>in the videos</strong>,\n I share more of my personal experience since I have been studying and \npracticing several styles of Qi Gong for over 20 years now.</li></ul> <p> \t My wish is that you'll find it incentive enough to go and explore Qi Gong planet for yourself. </p><p> \t <strong></strong>It's a wonderful journey and by all means,<strong> very worth to deeply improve our personal life as well as our living together on planet Earth.</strong> </p><p><strong></strong></p>",
