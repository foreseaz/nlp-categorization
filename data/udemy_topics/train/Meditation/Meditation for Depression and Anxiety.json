They find that meditating regularly, even for short periods of time, can help to improve one’s mental and physical well-being. Mindfulness helps to reduce stress, feelings of fear and tiredness. Mindfulness helps to lower blood pressure and pulse. The brain waves change and make the brain calmer and at the same time more productive.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Course Contents</strong> <br>  \t   + Introduction about mindfulness  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  + Worksheets to define one’s own goals, plans and tracking  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  + Video-based exercises for beginners and more advanced users  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  + Recommended reading and further resources<br>  \t<br>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Meditation Topics</strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Best posture for meditation  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Breathing meditations  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Dealing with depression  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Managing anxiety  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Managing anxiety before important situations  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Meditation for the Active Lives</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Meditation comes from the East.
