    "description": "<p>Finding Answers Within teaches two powerful tools, Meditation and Automatic Writing. </p><p><strong>Meditation</strong><br>Meditation is often over complicated and taught with rigid guidelines that make it difficult to use. This course will make it simple and easy for you to meditate. </p><p>In doing so you will be able to greatly relieve stress and anxiety, help to heal pain and suffering, and live with a wonderful sense of calm and well-being. </p><p><strong>Automatic Writing<br></strong>Automatic Writing is a lesser known but equally powerful technique. You will discover how to examine your inner most thoughts. In doing so you will find solutions to everyday challenges, as well as answers to bigger questions like, \"What is the meaning of my life\"? <br></p>Between these two techniques you will experience life with a new sense of calmness, less negative emotions, much more positive energy, and a greater sense of purpose and significance.",
