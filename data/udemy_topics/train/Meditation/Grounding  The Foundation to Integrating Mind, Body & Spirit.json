    "description": "<p>  \t          In this 30 minute course you will be introduced to the spiritual ideology and practice of Grounding.  </p>  <p>  \t         We will discuss how Grounding ideology teaches us to balance and harmonize our mind, body and spirit so we may fully manifest our spiritual essence into our present physical state and we will also cover practical ways to incorporate Grounding practices into our daily lives so we may reap the benefits of being more present in our lives.  </p>  <p>  \t  Along with lifetime access to the lectures &amp; quizzes, you will also be able to download a PDF copy of the presentation that was used during the course and a MP3 of the Grounding Meditation.  </p>  <p>  \t         My intention for you is that through this course you may better understand the importance of becoming more present and grounded in your life so that you may gain more clarity about the purpose of your life.  </p>",
