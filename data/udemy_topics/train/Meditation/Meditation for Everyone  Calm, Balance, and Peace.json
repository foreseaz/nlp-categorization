    "description": "<p>Meditation for Everyone shares the healing benefits of meditation. The lectures, guided meditations, and application worksheets are accessible to newcomers and experienced practitioners. The philosophy and life lessons shared are universal in nature. We cultivate feelings of love, compassion, and understanding. Willingness and open-mindedness are essential for the course. Our collective intention is awareness of breath in the present moment to find our natural state of calm, balance, and peace. The course can be completed at the pace of each individual student. The guided meditations can be played many times, as students will likely hear, feel, and experience something different each time they practice. The content of the videos can relieve students of stress, anxiety, and fear. Benefits of the course: a quiet mind, relaxed body, and conscious contact with the spirit, soul, or innermost self.  <br></p>",
