Both the iPhone and iPad have so many features and options that it becomes a bit overwhelming to learn what they do and how to use them correctly. This new course will help you understand what each Setting Option and Default app on the iPhone does and is capable of. The course is mapped out in short videos to help you learn and get the most of our your device.  </p>  <p>  \tYou donâ€™t necessarily need to know what each and every setting does in your iPhone, but this course will teach you. We see this course as being a Go-To resource for any iPhone question you have.  </p>  <p>  \tWe have created tutorial videos for each default app the iPhone comes with from the factory and the entire settings app. We have also included a few videos to help you get to know your device a bit better.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course will be broken up into 2 parts. One course on iOS 7 Settings and one course on the default apps that come pre-installed on your iPhone.  </p>",
