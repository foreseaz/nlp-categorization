    "description": "<p>  \t<span>If you have a Mac, you need this course.  There are so many hidden features that are included with your Mac that we don&#039;t use. The reason is because Apple never talks about them. The sad part is, that they are actually very powerful features.  For this course, I have compiled over 40+ videos that will show you these features step by step.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t      For example:  </p>  <p>  \t        Multitasking is a myth and in today&#039;s world, we all do it. We have so many tabs open and most often than not, we end getting distracted by that awesome article rather than focussing on that task in hand. Did you know that if you get too distracted, you can activate a single app mode in order for you to focus?  </p>  <p>  \t        These are the kind of things I have included in this course. I hope that after taking this course, you learn things about your mac that you were not aware of.  </p>",
