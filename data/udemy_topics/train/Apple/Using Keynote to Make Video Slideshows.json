    "description": "<p>Apple<strong> Keynote</strong> is a presentation program that is usually bundled with Apple hardware products. It's not as popular as Powerpoint, Microsoft's presentation program, but is every bit as effective for producing clear and lively presentation slideshows. With the right use of video segments, images, text, audio files, animations and timed transitions, a Keynote presentation can become a great video recording as well, which can be exported as a movie and published on sites like Udemy and Youtube, streamed from your own web site, or burned to a DVD. </p><p>This course by veteran Keynote user, Philip St. Romain, will show you how to make presentations that can be turned into entertaining and/or educational video slideshows that you'll be proud to share with others.</p>",
