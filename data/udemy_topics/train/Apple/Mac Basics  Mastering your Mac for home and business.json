    "description": "<p>This course is for those who are new to Apple computers. Whether you're transitioning from Windows, or you've just purchased a Mac for the first time, this course is built solely for you, the new Mac user. The only item required for this course is an Apple computer with at least Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8 ) installed on it.</p><p>(Click the Apple icon in the upper left-hand corner of your screen and tap \"About this Mac\" to see in the \"Overview\" tab , what version your operating system is.)</p><p>In short, this course will be like sitting down with a friend who gently guides and teaches you everything you need to know about your Mac. I loved taking care of people and their Macs while at Apple HQ, so you'll get nothing less here at Udemy.</p><p>Come join the thousands of students who've already taken the plunge to learn about one of the best computers ever made! </p><p><strong>Side note:</strong> This course has over 4.5 hours of content (you don't have to do it one sitting) and doesn't provide popcorn. So, if you plan to binge this course, grab your favorite snack and beverage, and get ready for some excitement. Also, I will continue to add more videos, so expect those 4.5 hours to increase. </p>",
