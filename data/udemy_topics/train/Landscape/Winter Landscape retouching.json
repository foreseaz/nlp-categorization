    "description": "<p>  \t  In this course I will show you how to retouch your winter photos into exciting and dramatic landscapes! Shooting and retouching in snow can be challenging, but with these easy to follow examples, youâ€™ll see that it is quite simple and the results are fantastic!  </p>  <p>  \t  We will retouch several different photos together to get a result of photos with a lot more color and a lot more drama. You will see the technique I use to give a lot more life to these photos taken in the snow.  </p>  <p>  \tWe will work on several different projects on a step by step basis, we will go over photos that have been taken in the country side but we will also go over photos that have been taken in the city. We will also cover photos that are entirely covered in snow, where there is little light and material to work on which can be quite challenging but in the end lots of fun. I will show you the techniques I use specifically for snow and winter landscapes.  </p>",
