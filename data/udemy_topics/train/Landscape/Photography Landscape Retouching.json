This is a very in-depth course specifically on landscapes and contains simple to advanced techniques. This course contains 10 projects and many of my RAW files to train with. You will learn how to be able to retouch landscapes, local adjustments of colors, luminosity masks, digital blending, how to control colors in Lightroom and how to recover an amazing hidden sunset using Luminosity mask to blend 3 exposures.  </p>  <p>  \tWe will work on several different projects, some that are easier and others that are a bit more complicated. At the end of this course you will know how to retouch all types of landscapes with ease.  </p>",
