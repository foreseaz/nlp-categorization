Right now, I have about three chapters of useful material complete. It&#039;s valuable stuff, though. There&#039;s 3+ hours of material. I&#039;d charge my students $60 per hour for that. This is an incredible deal!  </p>  <p class=\"PIN_1372985620103_hazClick\" style=\"\">  </p>  <p class=\"PIN_1372985620103_hazClick\" style=\"\">  \t  Definitely start your flight training concurrently with this course. I&#039;ve added a few useful handouts and put FAA sample questions throughout the material.  </p>",
