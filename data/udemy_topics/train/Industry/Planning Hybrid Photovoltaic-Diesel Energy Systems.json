This course teaches the steps to follow in planning hybrid energy systems combining solar and diesel generators.</p>\n\n<p>The course start with an introduction where the understanding of energy is fixed and hybrid energy systems defined; the course then continue with addressing the issue of load before describing the working principle and the sizing process of each of the component of hybrid diesel- photovoltaic energy systems. The course ends in presenting design and optimization tool and discussing the benefits of hybrid systems.</p>",
