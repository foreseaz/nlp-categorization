Many have shared with me that they have lost a significant percentage of search traffic over the past year or two, and are continuously looking for new ways to drive relevant traffic to their site. They have also shared with me that because they don't get traffic they often don't get the sales they need.  </p>  <p>  \t      As a business owner, you need 'traffic' to really win. Visitors to a site of your choice (whether it is one that you own or one you promote as an affiliate) is one of the most crucial parts needed to win.  </p>  <p>  \t      Without traffic, you don't cross the finish line. You don't collect the winner's check. You don't get the result you're working hard to achieve. You fall back in the pack while those with full tanks pass you by and take <strong>what could have been yours</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>If you want to significantly increase your revenue, you need to significantly increase your web traffic. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This is true no matter what business model you're using.  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>It doesn't matter if you're selling your own product at your own site.</li>  \t<li>It doesn't matter if you're promoting someone else's product as an affiliate.</li>  \t<li>It doesn't matter if you're trying to get people to click on AdSense ads.</li>  \t<li>It doesn't matter if you're blogging, flipping sites, coaching or anything else.</li>  \t<li>It doesn't matter if you're promoting business offers or non-business offers, low-cost offers or high-ticket offers, the point is:</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>You won't make a dime unless you </strong>get<strong> eyeballs in front of your offers.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      You will not – cannot – make money without traffic.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>But not just any traffic will do.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      You need responsive traffic. People who are interested in your particular offer, in fact eager to buy your offer because it's exactly what they want.  </p>  <p>  \t      The question is:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>How do you get this traffic?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Nobody has to convince you that you need traffic, right?  You got this figured out by now. You know that it's a numbers game … the more people who come to your site, the more sales you make.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>It's simple math.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      The reason other sites make great number of sales is because they get a great amount of traffic to their sites. All things being equal, the one who gets the most traffic gets the most orders.  </p>  <p>  \t      In essence…  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Traffic that is converting = money in the bank.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Preaching to the choir, right? <strong>You already know this.</strong> What you probably don't know is how to fuel up. What you probably don't know is how to get the maximum amount of traffic to your site with the minimum amount of effort and the least amount of money invested.  </p>  <p>  \t      I've got GREAT news for you…  </p>  <p>  \t      There is a way to get in front of millions of people per week starting at a couple hundred dollars. This is using an offline traffic method that you can completely dominate because your competition is being distracted by the next new shiny ball.  </p>  <p>  \t      That's right, these are the proven strategies and now <strong>I'm going to share them with you</strong>.
