    "description": "<p style=\"\">The videos  for this â€œIntroduction to  Psychology&quot; course are the ideal study tool for AP courses, CLEP:Introductory Psychology test preparation, and any college-level Introductory Psychology course.  They cover some of the key issues in the study of psychology,  and describe major theoretical frameworks for understanding what it is inside  you that makes you do the things you do.   Culled from the videos I use in my own courses, they&#039;re intended to supplement  materials you might have available from your own college (or high school)  psychology courses.  Additional videos  are available at the Social Psychology, Learning, and Personality courses here  on Udemy.</p>    <p style=\"\">Sign up for  this Introduction to  Psychology course and learn Psychology basics.</p>&lt;/p&gt;",
