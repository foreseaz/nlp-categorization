This course is designed for students who are learning principles of microeconomics and who want to have an understanding of how to analyze demand and supply with greater precision. <br><br>This course covers everything that you need to know about Elasticity to understand the other principles of microeconomics.I have included quiz and reason based questions as well to test your knowledge while learning.</p>\n\n<p>Prerequisite required - <br>Basic knowledge of Demand and Supply <br><br><strong>Note for all the entrepreneurs and businessmen who are interested in this course : </strong><br>This course does have a little bit of academic touch. For example : How to calculate price elasticity of demand might not seem useful to you but I suggest you to complete the full course and do not skip any lecture as all the topics are linked. Even when I am solving numericals /calculating elasticity , I do speak of some examples that could be helpful for you. <br>P.S - Don't try to save 10-15 minutes by skipping lectures if you want to gain the most out of this 1 hour course :) </p>",
