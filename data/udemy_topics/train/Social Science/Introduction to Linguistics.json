    "description": "<p>In this course, we look at the five major pillars of analytic linguistics. These five pillars tell us about the general properties of language and help us talk about the similarities and differences in languages. </p><p>The primary focus of the course will be teaching you the tools in our language toolbox using English. However, we will also look at different languages, such as Japanese, Marshalese, Khmer, Tagalog, and a few others.</p><p>The course primarily consists of videos, but I've included a couple practice exams that you can use to demonstrate your mastery of the course. </p><p>Even if you're not interested in demonstrating mastery, the content provided is incredibly interesting for those who wish to learn languages in the future. The tools you learn here will help you understand that not all languages have the same sets of rules and features, and that you can use that knowledge to help you learn other languages even faster! We discuss <strong>how you make sounds, how you put sounds together, word orders, conjugation, and more!</strong></p>",
