Those who had little &quot;skin in the game&quot; when it came to the stock market found out soon enough that companies will lay you off if they think the economy is going to get worse.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t If you want to build wealth, you must have an understanding of the world around you, and the best way to do that is to learn about different asset classes and how they interact with each other.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t This course will give you the ability to have a context for your investment decisions, so you can get better risk-adjusted returns.  </p>",
