    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Masculinity, as shaped by both men and women, has a profound impact upon  the world in which we live and functions as a core problem for social  sustainability. Yet few people stop to question the forms of masculinity  that have been passed to them, let alone construct a more conscious  alternative.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Via video, audio and text, Future Masculinity will help both men and women understand  how masculinity functions in contemporary society, and how it can be  re-imagined for a sustainable future.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Many of society&#039;s problems are related to the social construction of masculinity: How is masculinity defined? How is masculinity asserted within society?  These questions are answered in this course via a number of key themes: history, sexuality, relationships, fatherhood, archetypes, and spirituality.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t By questioning the social construction of masculinity within our  everyday lives, we can make massive changes to society encouraging a  more sustainable way of living that can be enjoyed by men, women,  children, and the world in which we live.  </p>",
