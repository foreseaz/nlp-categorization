    "description": "<p>Hello There, My name is Gavin Davies and I take a very wide interest in Economics and Business Studies. When I started learning Economics lots of very complicated terms were thrown into my face and I was expected to understand them further. I needed a resource that would teach me all of the basic concepts before I dived deeper into each one. This is why I have created this course, to try and help people who are in that position.</p><p>The course is only 30 minutes long and includes all that is needed to start learning economics quickly and easily.</p>",
