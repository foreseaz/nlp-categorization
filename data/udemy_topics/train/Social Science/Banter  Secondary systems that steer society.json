    "description": "<p style=\"\">Unlike Foundation Systems, which evolved around humanity over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, second order systems are created by humanity, and have existed from a few decades to several  years. They are primary drivers of human direction. These systems are eclectic. Some of the second order systems are not singles systems, but interconnected complexes of system that function as a single system. Looking at these systems will give us an understanding of and glimpse into connectivity and the creation of networks. We will also get a chance to look at the systems in the context of small world networks, which have been used to examine social patterns with in modern social networks. These interconnected networks provide structure not only to countries, but to our global society as well. These interconnected networks will explain how it is not strong connections that determine their movement but often it is weak ties that can often become crucial bridges between formations in these systems that can create new directions. The directions of these networks not only help shape the global and national economic structure, but the political structure of individual nations, and the overall philosophy which defines human society.</p>",
