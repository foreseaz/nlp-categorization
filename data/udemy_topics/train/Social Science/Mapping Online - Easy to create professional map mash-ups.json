I lead you through several lessons to take advantage of the Google maps interface to mash-up data you want to map. The course videos will allow you to go at your own pace and produce your first mash-up. Along the way, I equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to get ahead of the competition to make great map mash-ups, quick and easy. This course is for students who have basic to intermediate computer skills and no programming experience. Those interested in GIS should take this course.  </p>",
