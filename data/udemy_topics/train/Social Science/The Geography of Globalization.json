    "description": "<p>  \tThis course will explore the complexities related to globalization. It will examine the history of modern globalization, the critical ideologies, theories, and policies that helped to connect the world economies, and the impacts of globalization on culture, development, and the environment.  </p>  <p>  \tNo textbook is required for this course.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course is structured in a way that breaks down the concept of Globalization into fifteen (15) lectures (including the Introduction and Conclusion). Most lectures will be in video form and will have an organized PowerPoint to help frame each concept.  </p>  <p>  \tI believe this class will really provide perspective about our world, today. The human landscape has and continues to be shaped by the processes of Globalization, both in good ways and bad ways. After this course, you will understand the globalized world much better. I am confident that the lessons learned in this course can be applied at work, will support a deeper understanding of world issues, or just make you a more informed individual.  </p>",
