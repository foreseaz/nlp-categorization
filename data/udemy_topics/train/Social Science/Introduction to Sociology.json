Noted sociologists provide insights for understanding social groups and institutions, social change, and the sociological forces of daily life.  </p><p>Areas of exploration include:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Sociological Investigation</li><li style=\"\">Culture</li><li style=\"\">Social Interaction</li><li style=\"\">Groups and Organizations</li><li style=\"\">Deviance</li><li style=\"\">Sexuality</li><li style=\"\">Social and Global Stratification</li><li style=\"\">Race and Ethnicity</li><li style=\"\">Aging</li><li style=\"\">Economy and Work</li><li style=\"\">Politics and Government</li><li style=\"\">Family</li><li style=\"\">Education</li><li style=\"\">Religion</li><li style=\"\">Population and Urbanization</li><li style=\"\">Social Movements</li></ul>  <p>  \t                    Students visit Delancy Street, an innovative alternative to the correctional system that focuses on rehabilitating instead of simply housing criminal offenders. They meet the people of the Winnemem Wintu tribe of the Pacific Northwest and learn how government land and water policies have affected them. They gain perspective about how thoroughly issues of gender saturate daily life in our society through the players on a women&#039;s professional football team.  </p>  <p>  \t              The course is organized in 22 sections and covers all of the topics commonly taught in college introductory courses in Sociology.
