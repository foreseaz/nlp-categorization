    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course will teach you all about SQL Server&#039;s maintenance plans and what they can (and can&#039;t) do. The course starts out briefly covering SQL Server Agent and Database Mail, two  components of SQL Server that work in concert with Maintenance Plans. Next, you&#039;ll learn about every option available in maintenance plans and how to configure each option. You&#039;ll then see video demonstrations that will walk you through every step in the process of creating a maintenance plan using two different methods. And finally, you&#039;ll learn the limitations of maintenance plans and where to go next when your systems grow to the point of requiring a more complex maintenance solution. The course is taught using SQL Server 2012, but the content is applicable to SQL 2008 R2, SQL 2008, and SQL 2005. The entire course is over 1.5 hours.  </p>",
