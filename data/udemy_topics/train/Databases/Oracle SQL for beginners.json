    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Summary</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This introductory course teaches you how to work with data in your Oracle Database using Oracle&#039;s proprietary SQL language. It starts with the basic overview of what SQL is all about and then covers basic queries and common things you might be expected to do on a job. We then proceed to learn  complex queries  and data management such as inserting/updating/deleting data.  </p>  <p>  \t  All the SQL examples and the power point slides are available for download and there are a few exercises/queries at the end of each chapter for you to test your understanding. I&#039;ll try and add more each week. At the end of the course, we also discuss some of the frequently asked questions in Oracle SQL to assess our understanding of the course and various topics and to understand some of the frequently asked interview questions.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course should take about 2 weeks to complete, with 2-3 hours dedicated each day to go through the examples and work them out yourself.  </p>",
