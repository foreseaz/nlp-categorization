For people who don’t want to spend hours each week doing boring, monotonous paperwork that can be automated and be made easy, fun and professional looking.</p><p>I included the Filemaker file in the course for download so you can easily look at my file if you get lost somewhere or if there is something you want to look at more closely in detail.</p><p><span>At the end of this course you will be able to start your own FIlemaker projects and build them exactly the way you want them so they work for your company and not the other way around.  </span></p>",
