This is based on Oracle's SQL implementation for Oracle Databases. The lessons are based on Oracle 12c Database and SQL Developer Tools running in Windows 10.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About SQL:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SQL is used to interact with Database Systems. As per ANSI (American National Standards Institute), SQL is the standard language for Relational Database Management Systems.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SQL has been the prominent language to interact with various Database Systems for many decades. While many languages that existed two decades ago are extinct now, SQL has always maintained its supremacy in the RDBMS world. Over the time, it has only advanced with new features and standards. And it seems to stay that way for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About Oracle Database:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Oracle Database is one of the prominent Database Systems in the RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) segment. Some of the other prominent Database Systems are</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Microsoft SQL Server</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Sybase ASE.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>They also use SQL to interact with their Database Systems. While there are subtle differences between each of their SQL implementations, a SQL as a whole, is generally very standard. So a person with SQL knowledge in one platform such as Oracle, may find it easier to learn and code for other Database Systems such as Microsoft SQL or MySQL. </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>The point is, once you learn SQL, then your reach into the job market is very wide.</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><br></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About the Curriculum:</strong></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The curriculum has been carefully designed to introduce the Oracle RDBMS environment first.</li><li>Then it moves on to various types of SQL Statements such as DDL, DML and TCL.</li><li>And next, it goes to the depths of various SQL Statements, Conditions, Sorting, Functions, Grouping etc..</li><li>It also gives Database Administration tips, as needed.</li><li>It is also covers most of the topics from the Oracle SQL Certification Exam 1Z0-071 </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><br></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Oracle Certification:</strong></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Oracle awards certain certifications that are recognized globally</li><li>One such certification is Oracle Database 12c SQL Certified Associate</li><li>The exam for that certification is (currently as of May 2016), 1Z0-071.</li><li>The topics in this course covers most of the topics for that exam.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><br></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Oracle Certification - Declarations</strong></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li> While this course covers most of the topics for that exam, this course is not a sole material for that exam.
