You’ll learn how to use <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">analytic functions</strong>, how to take advantage of <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">table partitioning</strong>, how to write <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">user-defined functions</strong>, procedures with cursors and even how to write <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">beautiful code</strong>. All of that with the focus on <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">the</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">most </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">popular open-source</strong> database: MySQL.<br></p>\n\n<p>In this course we’ll write the code &amp; queries together. I prepared 2 test databases, 70+ lectures, 4+ hours of video and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">lots of examples</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> and practices</strong> so that you can learn advanced SQL techniques by writing the code. You’ll not learn just by watching me and eating pop-corn. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You need to write the queries</strong> and I’ll help you! I believe that’s the only way for you to really adopt this new knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this course you will not just <em>know</em> these advanced techniques, but also know <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><u>how to use them in practice</u>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To help you out, I also created a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Slack group</strong> where you can join and chat with me or my colleagues if you get stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways, you have <strong>nothing to lose.</strong> Try this course and if you can honestly say that you learnt nothing, just email Udemy and <strong>they will give you a 100% refund within 30 days.</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Last course update: May 2016</li><li>Video quality: Very high (1080p HD, 1920x1080)</li></ul>\n\n<p>Enjoy &amp; have fun with SQL! :-)</p>",
