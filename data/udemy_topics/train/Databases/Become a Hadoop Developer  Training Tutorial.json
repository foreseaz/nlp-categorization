At the end of the course there are exam like quiz questions which would test your readiness to face and clear the exam. Because the exam pattern keeps changing, I would highly recommend to go through Cloudera practice papers to be in perfect preparation for the exam.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Ques&gt; D</strong><strong style=\"\">o you give exam dumps?</strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                          &gt; Nope.
