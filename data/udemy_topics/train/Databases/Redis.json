    "description": "<p>  \t    Redis is a powerful in-memory database. You could liken it to memcached yet with better data type handling. You may find yourself using Redis as a medium to process vast amounts of data.  </p>  <p>  \t    Other examples may be using Redis for real-time chat logging, scoreboards, or simply a powerful caching engine. You will need to be familiar with a terminal to take this course. I recommend GitSCM for Windows, or Terminator for Linux,  </p>  <p>  \t    This series is simple, we go through the Data Type and Commands, and you follow by example. We&#039;ll also integrate a PHP and Python client to show how easy it is to use as an abstracted adapter in two popular languages.  </p>  <p>  \t    It&#039;s highly encouraged you use SSH or Linux to use the Redis CLI. The Windows binary works but it can be a bit unstable.  </p>  <p>  \t    This course will guide you through the commands (Not every single one), but it will get you started so that it makes sense. This course will take around 2 - 3 weeks to fully understand the material and practice it.  </p>",
