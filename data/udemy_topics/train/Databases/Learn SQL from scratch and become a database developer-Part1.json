This is the first part of a 2 parts course which covers the following topics:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Database Basics</strong></li><li><strong>Retrieving Data</strong></li><li><strong>Filtering Data</strong></li><li><strong>Scalar Functions</strong></li><li><strong>Aggregate Functions</strong></li><li><strong>Joining Tables</strong></li><li><strong>Grouping Data</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><strong></strong></strong><br></p><p>For the most part, the SQL learned in the course is applicable to all major databases. In the few cases in which there are differences between the databases, these differences will be pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 sample databases provided with this course. SQLMain is used throughout the demonstrations. The second one is a Microsoft developed sample database that you can have fun with after you finish the course. Besides the video tutorials and sample databases, this course includes a 186 pages PDF book about SQL that I have written. Some of the concepts covered in the book will be demonstrated in this course leaving the remaining ones to be presented in part 2 of the course.</p>\n\n<p>I myself started learning on my own with no mentor and no place where to get the exact information that I needed. This is one of the reasons this course is structured in such a way that you can start writing SQL code in hours with ease. </p>\n\n<p>I recommend taking one lecture once every 2 or 3 days. This way you will have time to get used with the terminology and also have time to practice what you learned on your own. This course is not going to make you a SQL guru overnight. It takes practice and patience to get there. </p>\n\n<p>Let's get started and learn SQL language together. The easy way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good to know:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>In order to have a better learning experience please watch the videos in HD.</strong></li><li><strong>30 days money back guarantee.
