    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tThis course teaches the principles of Relational Databases and the SQL language. It is intended for &quot;Analysts&quot;. Knowledge of Relational Databases and SQL is one of the most valued technical skills an analyst can have. It will make you a more valued member of any team.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course is suitable for a novice. I start by explaining how Relational Databases relate to your experience in the everyday world. When you have completed the course and exercises you will have created a database containing several related tables, updated the data they contain and written many queries which extract and summarise that data.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI teach using a mixture of lectures, demonstrations and exercises. You will learn by seeing, hearing and doing. With each step you build your knowledge using what you have learned already. An on-line course sets you free to work at your own pace and to review and revisit earlier material, even after you have completed the course.  </p>",
