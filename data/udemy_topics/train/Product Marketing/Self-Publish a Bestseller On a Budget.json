    "description": "<p style=\"\">In this course, I will show you step-by-step how I created and marketed bestselling books on a shoestring budget. Each lesson will include screenshot tutorials in addition to tips and tricks not found anywhere else. You will also get recommendations of the best sites to use to outsource any work, specific people I have used in the past for the job and so much more. Most of the course is via video, but occasionally I will add written tutorials or include links for further information or study. This course is intended for any author who wants their self-published book to rise beyond the expectation of only friends and family purchasing their books to establishing a readership. <br style=\"\"></p>",
