    "description": "<p>Product Managers and Product Management has been gaining currency in the last decade or so. The Product Manager is called the CEO of the Product he manages and therefore the success or failure of the Product is largely a function of how the Product Manager functions. </p><p>However, there has been very little available in terms of a formal course on Product Management. It is this lacuna that this course seeks to address. This course has been structured as a self study module for Product Management. </p><p>This course is perfect for entrepreneurs, product manager aspirants or anyone who likes to build products. You will learn the basics of product management, wireframing and an introduction to web based analytics. Also included are template files for making a Product Requirement Document and Wireframes</p>",
