    "description": "<p>  \t      This course addresses the multiple issues social media and new  technology generates in the supply chain and logistics markets  (“SC&amp;L”). The industry terminology used throughout this course, is  mainstream within SC&amp;L industry. The course focuses on traditional  communications in the SC&amp;L which until now have been unidirectional,  in that it informs only in one direction or another, e.g., customer  relationship management (“CRM”) - aimed at just for consumers. Social  media amalgamated with new technology is now enabling omnidirectional  communications, which is contributing to increased complexity in the  SC&amp;L. If you are working in  SC&amp;L in roles such as; procurement, operations, distribution, sales  and marketing, distribution, freight management and manufacturing  functions - this is a course for you  </p>",
