But you can set up the processes and tools to strengthen communication.</p><p>Visibility is an aspect of communication that can easily be addressed in remote teams if you know:</p><ul><li>How it affects <strong>motivation</strong>,</li><li>The best <strong>processes</strong> for your team and</li><li>What <strong>tools</strong> can help you.</li></ul><p>In this course we address those three things through videos and pdfs. Your first task will be to answer 6 questions about your team, to help you identify the problem you're trying to solve. Your last task will be to write down some specific steps to help you apply the course material. </p><p>If you are working in a virtual team and don't want distance to be a barrier to great, productive teamwork, join us.  </p>",
