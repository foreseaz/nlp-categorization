This online course is a steal at this price, given it is charged like 5 times (around $500 or so) offline in Canada.&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    -------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"> Hussain Ahmed </strong> - &quot;This is one of course in Udemy and the instructor has broken down this complex subject so well that it will be easy for even a novice to understand Image processing concepts and start working right away and learn Matlab.&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t-------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Rajendra</strong> - &quot;I was always interested in image processing/computer vision stuff and didn&#039;t find any place to get started. Luckily this course gave me the initial thrust that i badly needed to get started. He does a good job of reviewing theory and implement using matlab. &quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t-------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  MATLAB&#039;s Image Processing (IP) toolbox is <strong style=\"\">insanely popular </strong>and widely used in almost all academic Institutions and Enterprises. That&#039;s because, it is so well written and organized, that it makes this toolbox very user-friendly for even the toughest of the IP operations.</p><p style=\"\">If you want to learn MATLAB for your Work or College, this is the right course for you. This course teaches you this complete Image Processing toolbox from scratch. All the theoretical concepts have been explained in presentations with examples. Then, their implementation is covered with Matlab Programming. All these presentation files and working Matlab scripts are provided as supplementary materials along with the lectures.  You don&#039;t need any previous Matlab Programming experience to take this course, as it starts everything from scratch.</p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  The course content covers all the (Beginner and Intermediate Level) topics in IP toolbox like Image Filtering, Noise Removal, Morphological Operations, Histogram operations, Image Thresholding, Edge Detection and basics of Image Segmentation. Several quizzes have been set up to keep a track of your performance and understanding. <strong style=\"\">Besides all the theoretical content, some real world applications have been covered as well in the form of Projects Like &quot;</strong><strong style=\"\">Detect the faces of all your friends in an image&quot;</strong></p><p style=\"\">This is your complete guide to starting your journey with MATLAB. If you are not 100% satisfied with the course then I personally <strong style=\"\">guarantee you the full-money back! No Questions Asked! </strong>Though, I am sure you will be more than satisfied, like other students here. So, <strong style=\"\">Enroll now</strong> and start learning!<strong style=\"\"></strong></p>",
