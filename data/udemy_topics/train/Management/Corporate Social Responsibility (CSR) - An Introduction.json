    "description": "<p>  \t  There is a lot of misunderstanding what Corporate Social Responsibility really is about- Philanthropy, green PR or indeed a piece of new Conscious Capitalism? This course was designed for you! You, if you want to get to know what CSR is about, first-hand: its development, how it is implemented today and where it is heading in the future. In less than an hour, you will learn the &quot;logics&quot; of CSR and find out how it is really connected to the idea of Sustainability.  </p>  <p>  \t  You will be guided through a Prezi-Presentation with pictures, text, infographics and my voice in the background.  </p>  <p>  \t  If you are tired of skipping through books, reading blogs and watching YouTube Videos to understand CSR, then enroll into this course and get your full understanding of what Corporate Social Responsibility truly is and its vital role in the business world. Get inspired and see what you, being the customer or the CSR professional, could do to help CSR evolve.  </p>  <p>  \t  Your peers have reported to have had an &quot;aha-&quot;moment after going through this course, I most certainly hope the same will happen for you! Welcome to the course.  </p>",
