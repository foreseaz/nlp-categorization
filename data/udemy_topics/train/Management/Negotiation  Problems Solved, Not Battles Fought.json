The focus is on preparation and taking a problem solving approach (integration and creativity in the final solution). The material is perfect as a first course, or as a refresher before a big negotiation. We use video, notes, and a dynamic website for feedback. Prof. Terri Griffith is a full time faculty member at Santa Clara University in the Silicon Valley and has been leading dynamic workshops for managers and entrepreneurs&nbsp;since the early 1990s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
