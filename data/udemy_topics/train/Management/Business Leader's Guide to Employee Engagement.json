    "description": "<p>Welcome to the Finance Professional’s Guide to Employee Engagement course where you will learn about how to drastically improve results across your entire organization by simply engaging employees.  </p>\n\n<p>Employee engagement used to be a topic reserved for HR professionals.  But, thankfully, now engagement is often seen as a responsibility of business leaders across the entire organization.  We live in a world where employees at all levels use their own independent judgement to make decisions that affect financial results everyday.  Building an engaged workforce means that employees will be motivated and empowered to make the right decisions that support the company’s success, even when no one is looking.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will know what employee engagement is, why it is so important, how to get it in your organization, and how to measure it.  We will talk about very real data from many studies, reports, and real life examples that show a direct line from employee engagement to business results, both financial and otherwise.  </p>\n\n<p>The ideal student for this course is a finance executive, or anyone who aspires to become a finance executive, who wants to see their company achieve extraordinary results.  I look forward to seeing you on the inside!</p>",
