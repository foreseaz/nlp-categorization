    "description": "<p>PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) is a structured project management method based on experience drawn from thousands of projects - and from the contributions of countless project sponsors, Project Managers, project teams, academics, trainers and consultants</p>\n\n<p>PRINCE2 is a non-proprietary method and has emerged worldwide as one of the most widely accepted methods for managing projects. This is largely due to the fact that PRINCE2 is truly generic - it can be applied to any project regardless of project scale, type, organization, geography or culture.</p>\n\n<p>PRINCE2 achieves this by isolating the management aspects of project work from the specialist contributions, such as design, construction etc. The specialist aspects of any type of project are easily integrated with the PRINCE2 method and, used alongside PRINCE2, provide a secure overall framework for the project work.</p>\n\n<p>Because PRINCE2 is generic and based on proven principles, organizations adopting the method as a standard can substantially improve their organizational capability and maturity across multiple areas of business activity - business change, construction, IT, mergers and acquisitions, research, product development and so on.</p>",
