    "description": "<p>  \tMy book, Generational Insights, has helped managers from broad arrays of businesses better understand and engage the generations that make up today's workforce. This course features teachings from the book, along with practical application examples.</p>  <p>  \tFrom face time to Facebook, each of the generations in the workforce today sees the world through a unique lens. What may seem like minor nuance at first glance is actually a fundamental difference in how they view the world. The result is a disconnected workforce with few areas of common ground. </p><p>In this course, you will learn from over a decade of experience researching the generational divide in the workplace to identify solutions for the problems that arise when managers and employees are not speaking the same language or worse, are using the same words in completely different context.</p><p>You will be better enabled to communicate  with multiple generations in the workforce and to learn how to turn the unique qualities of each generation into strengths for better business outcomes.</p>",
