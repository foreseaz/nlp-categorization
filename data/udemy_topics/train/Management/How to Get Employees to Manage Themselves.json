    "description": "<p> We'll start our educational journey by having a discussion of the current state of work as a functional/cultural platform. We'll examine the challenge you face as a manager inside this system and how it's affecting the productivity, engagement, morale, motivation and the focus of your workforce. Next, we'll establish the high-performance platform with take-aways on how to begin building a culture of competence, not complacency. Then you will learn techniques on how to go from utilizing a 20th century management style when managing performance, to deploying the behaviors of a 21st century Results Coach. See how to turn your conversations into objective, productive conversations. At the end of each section, you will take a workplace survey to get an idea of how your workplace stacks up against the high-performance platform. This course is for people managers, small business leaders, entrepreneurs and MBA students. <br style=\"\"></p>",
