Although change is how we evolve and grow we often suffer through the phases of a transition that we experience.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Using slides and reflective activities participants will be encouraged to question their own patterns, resistances and emotions while going through a change process. The better equipped we are to understand our own emotions and barriers through a change process the better we will be able to thrive through any change.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Whether we need to navigate through change on a personal level or help a team member, family member, friend etc. through a change process this course will allow you to gain some simple yet effective tools and concepts to successfully thrive through a transition.  </p>",
