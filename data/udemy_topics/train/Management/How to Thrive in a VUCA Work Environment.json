    "description": "<p>The acronym <strong><em>VUCA</em></strong> - <strong>Volatile</strong>, <strong>Uncertain</strong>, <strong>Complex</strong>, and <strong>Ambiguous</strong> - was coined in the 1990s. </p><p>It describes many people's experience of their workplace extremely well.</p><p><em><strong>In this kind of environment, it can be hard to feel like you are coping - let alone thriving.</strong></em></p><p>That's certainly how I felt!</p><p>It's also something that training participants and seminar audiences have been asking me about for years. So I decided to collate the ten best tools and principles I know into a short, sharp course.</p><p>One of the most valuable approaches to thriving in a VUCA world is the <strong><em>Pareto Principle</em></strong>; the <em><strong>80:20 rule</strong></em>...</p><p>The 80:20 rule says that you get 80 per cent of the value from the best 20 per cent of the ideas... </p><p>... when you apply it well.</p><p><strong>So, here is the best 20 per cent.</strong></p><p>Apply it well, and you'll make a huge difference to your success at work.</p><p>Good Luck!<br><strong><em>Mike</em></strong> </p><p>Dr Mike Clayton</p><p><br></p>",
