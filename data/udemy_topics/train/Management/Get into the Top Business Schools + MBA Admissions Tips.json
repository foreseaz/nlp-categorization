You don't need the best grades or test scores to get into the top business schools. I will teach you the secrets on how to get in. I received an MBA from Columbia University and I have helped all of my associates and interns over the years get into the top business schools, including many at Harvard Business School, Wharton, University of Chicago, Stanford, INSEAD, Columbia, NYU, Duke, UCLA and many more! You don't need to have above average test scores or a high GPA. In this course I will teach you only what you need to get in. I will be updating the course often. Thanks</p>",
