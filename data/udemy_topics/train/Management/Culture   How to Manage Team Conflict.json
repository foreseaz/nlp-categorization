How to manage team conflict with Learoy Tonight will provide you with the skills and knowledge to understand what drives culture and what you can do to create and foster the one that's right for you.</p><p style=\"\">If you thought you were living in a world where conflict never exists, well I'm about to burst your bubble, because it does. If you already knew that but thought, 'Hey, my team members are adults – they'll figure it out themselves', then guess what? They won't.</p><p style=\"\">The reality is, when you avoid conflict, it doesn't go away. It just bubbles under the surface, festers and creates divides. Between two individuals, it can likely become a situation whereby each person recruits on either side. This causes rifts across the whole team. In most cases, if you don't deal with it early, you'll be managing many of the symptoms before you ever get to the real cause.</p><p style=\"\">Each lecture in this course has been carefully selected for you to explore how to implement relevant and meaningful strategies to support you as a leader and culture driver now and in the future.</p><p style=\"\">This course will provide you with many tips and tricks you can utilize inside and out of your workplace, it will encourage and motivate you to really understand and support the environment you're trying to create.</p><p style=\"\">Learoy Tonight is a fresh business with interesting and modern ideas towards education.
