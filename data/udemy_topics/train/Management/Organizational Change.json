Hence, organizational change is simply \"must\" for any company. In this course we will go through basic definitions and concepts and will explain to you basic options that we have herein.</p><p><br></p><p>Hand in hand with change goes organizational learning and decision making. Organizations must learn from their experience and according to that make decisions. That is why the second and third module of this course is covering these two topics. Especially interesting is the last part when we take a look at the factors (biases) that are negatively affecting the learning and decision making of managers.</p>",
