Many thanks. </em><em>“ </em><em>- Irina</em>  </p>  <p>  \t    About Tina Ziegler, the creator and teacher of Art Gallery Management and Exhibition Design.  </p>  <p>  \t    &quot; My name is Tina Ziegler, I have been working in the arts as a curator and gallery manager for 9 years. I created Stimulus Workshops in 2010 and started this Art Gallery Management and Exhibition Design course. Since then I have taught over 200 individuals in London, UK. This course was created to teach the reality of what goes on inside a gallery and the things you need to know before you start working in an art gallery, managing artists, organising exhibitions or handling art works. I realised after running a gallery in London that many educated individuals were applying to work in the gallery, however they lacked the necessary hands on skills that were required to handle the day to day of working and running a Contemporary Art Gallery. Many individuals understood curating, or how the art market worked, but didn&#039;t know how to package a painting, hang a piece of art or manage an artist. So this course teaches you just that; The day to day tools you will need to know to work in an art gallery, curate an exhibition, sell art or even open your own gallery space.&quot;  </p>",
