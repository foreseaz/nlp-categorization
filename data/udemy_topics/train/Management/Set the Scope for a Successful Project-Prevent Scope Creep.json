    "description": "<p>  \t   I have seen the start of a lot of projects! Everyone wants to get a project off to a good start, but Analysis and Requirements projects are notoriously difficult to define.  This course teaches a technique I have used to define the boundaries of all sorts of things. I&#039;ve used it as an individual, with a team and with larger groups. I have found it useful. I think you will too.  </p>  <p>  \t   You will have heard Project Managers complain about “Scope Creep”, Scope creep is when the “To-Do list” keeps growing, especially when it grows faster than we are completing the tasks. Projects work better when: we know what we need to achieve, the scope is fixed, we are not being given extra things to do and the Project Manager and team are not constantly having argue against “things being added”. A clear project scope is one way of combating scope creep.  </p>  <p>  \t   An analysis project may not start with clear boundaries. If “A clear scope makes for a sound project”, how do we define that scope without performing the analysis? This course shows you how to do just that!  </p>",
