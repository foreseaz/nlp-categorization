Modern Wheat is a Brand Spankin&#039; New food that our bodies can&#039;t process very well (some having more trouble than others).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t This is Part Two of the &quot;Get Out of the Gluten Glut&quot; series of courses. It covers how to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle, how to get tested for Celiac/Gluten Sensitivity, how to face and avoid common challenges &amp; pitfalls and special considerations for the very sensitive. Lecture notes include recipes and food guides.

(Each lecture is accompanied by a fill-in-the-blank worksheet that can be completed during or after the lecture.)  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">What tests are available for Celiac/Gluten Sensitivity &amp; which are best?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How do I do an elimination diet?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What foods contain gluten?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How do I deal with Wheat Withdrawal?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How do I survive in the gluten-full world?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How strict do I need to be with my gluten-free diet?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How does wheat affect blood sugar?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What special considerations do I need to make if I&#039;m very sensitive?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What athletes and celebrities are on a gluten-free diet?</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe new &quot;trend&quot; of gluten-free eating is not a trend at all! It&#039;s an important precaution against developing a chronic health condition or dangerous disease.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tDamage done by gluten can happen slowly over time so it might be confused with &ldquo;normal aging&rdquo;. But, the damage can be stopped... and can often be reversed!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe material is not overly scientific- just enough to get the gist. And I tried to make it fun with animations and strong visuals.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe two well-known conditions caused by wheat, Gluten Intolerance and Celiac Disease, have a frustratingly enormous variety of potential symptoms!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">What Are the Students Saying?
