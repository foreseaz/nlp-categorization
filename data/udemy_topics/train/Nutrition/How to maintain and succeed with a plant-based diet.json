These are also tips I've learned from other health coaches and veg heads alike. It should take about an hour or two to go through everything completely. All material is downloadable, also there is external videos and materials that I believe will be beneficial during this process. </p><p>Some points that I will touch on are: Meal planning and preparing, Storage, Picking foods wisely, Meal replacements, Equipment, and Spice.This material is simple for anyone to follow that you can teach it to someone else. This course is also for any that is a raw vegan or vegan.</p><p><br></p>",
