Modern Wheat is a Brand Spankin&#039; New food that our bodies can&#039;t process very well (some have more trouble than others).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         This is Part Three of the &quot;Get Out of the Gluten Glut&quot; series of courses. It is an extension of <a href=\"http://www.udemy.com/glutenglut\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Part One</a> because it expands on the immune response that many bodies have to gluten. It covers leaky gut &amp; autoimmune disease in not-boring detail to provide a great understanding about how it might be affecting you.

But, the damage can be stopped... and can often be reversed!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         The material is not overly scientific- just enough to get the gist. And I tried to make it fun with animations and strong visuals.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         The two well-known conditions caused by wheat, Gluten Intolerance and Celiac Disease, have a frustratingly enormous variety of potential symptoms!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;~~&gt;&lt;</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">What Are the Students Saying?
