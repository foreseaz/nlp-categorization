This course makes sure that won't happen to you.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">'zoom in':</strong> Getting the details is very important in economics - you really have to understand the nitty-gritty of graphs and intersecting curves and lines. There is a lot of meaning in those details</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">'zoom out':</strong> The real value of economics, particularly microeconomics, is in taking seemingly over-simplified models, and then applying insights from those over-simplified models to the world at large. This course makes sure you can go from the specific to the general.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What's Covered:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Game Theory: </strong>Discounting and price wars, Prisoner's dilemma and nuclear arms races, Winner-takes-all games and the commercialization of sport.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Competition:</strong> Perfect competition, monopoly and monopolistic competition</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Firm Costs:</strong> The deep meaning underlying total and marginal costs, and the least-cost principle</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Utility and Consumer Equilibrium:</strong> Indifference curves, and relating price and value. Income effects, and deriving Demand curves from indifference curves</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Applications of Elasticity:</strong> Modeling taxes, the troublesome economics of agriculture, minimum wages. </li><li><strong>Elasticity, Demand and Supply:</strong> Defining and using elasticity. Linear Demand Curves and a neat trick. Demand and Supply demystified.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Talk to us!</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mail us about anything - <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">anything!</strong> - and we will always reply :-)</p>",
