I got into SWHC at $27.13 after it came off its high then moved up in higher than average volume. As you know Friday looked pretty good. Then Monday happened...luckily as soon as I got in, I put a stop at 25.64. I had literally NO stress as SWHC moved 18% off of my buy price. I took my $118 loss and moved on. It was a truly enlightening experience. Your class and delivery made a lot of sense to me. It was after going through the classes that I was able to conceptualize and enact a Risk Management plan. I have a strict 5% stop loss rule. Also, my acceptable R is no more than 1% of my capital.
