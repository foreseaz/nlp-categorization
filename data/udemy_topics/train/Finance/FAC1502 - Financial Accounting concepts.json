If you haven't studied before, if you've forgotten what you learnt at school, or even if you're happy with your understanding and just need to learn how to pass the exams with your knowledge, you will find this course very valuable.</p><p>As a lecturer, I focus on WHY you're studying each topic, not just HOW to do it. Also, I can help you gather marks in your questions, even if you're not 100% comfortable with the whole answer.</p><p>Remember, we're NOT part of UNISA, but our experience with lecturing UNISA students over the years can help you pass first time!</p>",
