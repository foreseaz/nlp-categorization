    "description": "<p> In this short course we go through the main steps leading to the elaboration of the budget for an EU project proposal. We first analyse the typical cost items considered eligible by the European Commission, and then we show how to use these concepts to build up the proposal&#039;s budget. We also analyse the cost models for three different programmes, namely Horizon 2020, Erasmus+ and LIFE+. As a prerequisite for getting the maximum out of this course, the learner is supposed to have a general knowledge of how to set up a proposal and of the meaning of such terms as Consortium, Partner and Workpackage. </p>",
