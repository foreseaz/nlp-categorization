Do I think this course is worth $99 - yes. Definitely. Can everyone afford $199. No obviously not. I want to sell more courses and you want to buy courses you can afford.</em></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">So, if Udemy and the Udemy Marketplace are saying that $19 is an affordable and accessible price level, who can beat the market? </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">This is not a competitive promotion</em></strong><em style=\"\">. This is a test to see if this is the right price to convince you, my potential student, that you can afford to pay me $19 for the hard work I have put in to make this course.</em></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Please tell me if you think this makes sense or I am being really stupid?
