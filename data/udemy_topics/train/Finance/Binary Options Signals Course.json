Once you understand more what a signal is I review the various binary signals services including the pros and cons.</p><p><strong>What do I need for this course?</strong></p><p>You don't require anything however I highly recommend having a beginner understanding of <em>binary options</em>, forex or CFD trading. I have published other course which I recommend to complete before moving onto this course.</p><p>If you are already trading binary options and after more signals then you can start this course straight away, I'm confident you will find invaluable information here.</p><p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong></p><p>The course starts with an introductory lesson which I suggest you watch first especially if you have no knowledge of what is a binary options signal. If you are familiar or have used a signal service then I jump right in to the various service reviews.</p><p><strong>Why take this course?</strong></p><p>As I mentioned before, you should take this course to start you understanding of what is a binary options signal and why traders use them.</p>",
