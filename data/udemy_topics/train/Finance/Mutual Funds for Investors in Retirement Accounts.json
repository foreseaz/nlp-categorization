US retirement system is one of the areas with a lot of opaqueness and unnecessary complexity, and also the area that has a massive impact on your quality of life.  The goal of this class is to get you to understand how your retirement money is invested and how much it is costing you.  Our hope is that by following the recommendations in this class, you will adjust your retirement portfolio, so that it is invested more prudently, and will allow you to retire with significantly more money than you otherwise would.  Students who have applied our principles to their retirement accounts, have been able to save hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>",
