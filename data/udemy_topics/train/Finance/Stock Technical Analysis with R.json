It is also essential for academic careers in quantitative finance.  And it is one of the two most common analysis techniques for DIY investors.</p><p>But as learning process can become difficult as complexity grows, this course helps by leading you through step by step real world practical examples for greater effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>This practical course contains over 45 lectures and more than 7 hours of content. It’s designed for all stock technical analysis knowledge levels and a basic understanding of R statistical software is useful but not required.</p><p>At first, you’ll learn how to download stock data and perform technical analysis operations by inputting instructions from R script files in the RGui console. Next, you’ll calculate lagging stock technical indicators such as simple moving averages (SMA), exponential moving averages (EMA), Bollinger bands® (BB), parabolic stop and reverse (SAR). After that, you’ll compute leading stock technical indicators such as average directional movement index (ADX), commodity channel index (CCI), moving averages convergence/divergence (MACD), rate of change (ROC), relative strength index (RSI), stochastic momentum index (SMI) and Williams %R.</p><p>Then, you’ll define single technical indicator based stock trading openings through price, double, bands, centerline and signal crossovers. Next, you’ll determine multiple technical indicators based trading opportunities through price crossovers which need to be confirmed by second technical indicator band crossover. Later, you’ll give shape to stock trading strategies which are long (buying) or short (selling) using single or multiple technical indicators trading occasions.</p><p>Finally, you’ll evaluate stock trading strategies performance with buy and hold as initial benchmark and comparing their annualized return for performance, annualized standard deviation for volatility or risk and annualized Sharpe ratio for risk adjusted return.</p>",
