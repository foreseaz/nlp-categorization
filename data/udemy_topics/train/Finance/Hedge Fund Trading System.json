    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this free Forex trading system, you will discover how I trade for a living. It is not only me who is using this (or similar) trading systems. There are at least a few dozen of trend-following hedge funds that use the same approach to make money on the financial markets. I am sharing my knowledge with all new/experienced traders eager to learn a consistently winning trading strategy that has been working for me for the past 5 years. I would love to make this system accessible to as many traders as possible and that is why I wanted to make it free. I have tried to keep it as concise as possible, so not wasting your time with unnecessary details. In the end- time is money!</p><p style=\"\">The goal of this course apart from showing you a trading system that has been working for me for a long time is to try to protect you from the dangers of the financial markets. I have been day-trading (unsuccessfully) for some time before discovering that longer-term trading is actually the only way to profit from the markets. I know a lot of you are extremely eager to make money quick, but this is not the point of this course. I would like to show you a system that works in the long-term. More and more people are trying to make quick money in the financial markets nowadays, but less and less are making money in the short term. As some of you already know- trading is a zero-sum game. In other words, for every winner there is a loser. That&#039;s what I will try to help you with- how to be on the winning side in the long-term.</p><p style=\"\">I am sorry if my english is not perfect, but it is not my native language. I still believe that for trading there are no barriers and traders should follow their dreams. I will do my best to help you reach your goals (financial), but there is one thing I cannot do for you- I cannot teach you how to be disciplined! That is something that you need to discover yourself in order to be a successful trader...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      OK. Back to the system- it is a simple trend-following discretionary trading system. I have included 10 videos and a trading manual. Please make sure that you read the trading manual before watching the videos. In this way, you would be prepared what to expect and would better grasp the trading system.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      The biggest prize for me would be if I can help new/experienced traders become even more successful!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Last but not least- I would like to thank especially to 3 TRADERS that helped me become a successful trader and follow my dreams- Colibri Trader, Paul (a.k.a. The Flipper) and Brett!</strong></p><p style=\"\">For the sake of the course: </p><p style=\"\">I am using the website Tradingview to show the charts. I do not want to be associated with any brokers, so that is why I am using a free trading website open to anyone. I am not here to make money by referring traders to brokers, although I would like to warn you to be careful when choosing one. There are a lot of bad seed out there. Lastly, I have done the trading manual easily downloadable here, so you can just get it with one click of a mouse. </p><p style=\"\">When you are taking this course, it is not necessary to have prior experience in trading since I go over the basics in the beginning. But for a complete FOREX newbie, it might still be a bit tough to get all of the pieces of information in one go. I anyways try to be as simple to follow as possible. In the end, my trading system is straightforward and effective if one is using it correctly. </p><p style=\"\">Keywords: FREE, FOREX, Forex, FX, TRADING, Trading, Strategy, Forex Strategy, Trading System, Forex System, day trading forex, trading forex, stock market, index, DAX, EUR/USD, trend-following, forex brokers, brokers</p>",
