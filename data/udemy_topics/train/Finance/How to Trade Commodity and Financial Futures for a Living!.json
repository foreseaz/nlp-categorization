The majority of Americans do not know how costly these <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">plans </strong>really are.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As your <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">situation</strong> stands now, over the next 20 years you will likely <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">lose </strong>over $100,000 in administrative, asset management, and marketing fees to your 401(k) mutual fund providers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When the stock market <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">tanked</strong> in 2003 Stacey was stuck in company stock through her 401(k).

All it takes is a few thousand — or as little as 10 percent of your portfolio — and a couple of hours a month of your time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Leverage: The Secret Weapon of the Mega-Wealthy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What is the underlying <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">secret</strong> to the huge success of this Udemy course?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You learn <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">techniques</strong> for leveraging and controlling risk developed by successful traders.
