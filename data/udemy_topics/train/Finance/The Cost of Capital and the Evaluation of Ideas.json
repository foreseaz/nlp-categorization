    "description": "<p>This course is about the cost of capital. Every time and entrepreneur has a <strong>new business idea</strong> or a firm decides to invest in a new plant, equipment or enter in a new market, the first concerns are:  1. Will the investment create value? 2. How to finance it? The cost of capital has to purpose to answer to both of this questions, so it is a central point in capital budgeting. </p><p><strong>Every entrepreneur or manager must know in which way it is calculated.</strong> </p><p>The course is structured in three video lectures with US English captions and two articles. The overall time for the video lectures is about 35 minutes but I strongly suggest students not to watch all the lectures in a row. </p><p>Keep calm and study corporate finance. ;-)</p><p><br></p>",
