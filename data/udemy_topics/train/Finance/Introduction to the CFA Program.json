Rob Thakur, CFA, one of Fitch Learning&#039;s most experienced CFA trainers, will take you through everything you need to know about the Program, and give you his expert tips on how to approach Level I.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The CFA charter</a>&nbsp;</strong>is an elite designation. It is considered the gold standard within the investment profession, and its typical candidates include fund managers, analysts, investment bankers, portfolio managers and traders. The designation is career-enhancing, well respected, credible, globally recognised and globally relevant.&nbsp;<br><br>The curriculum is based on the Candidate Body of Knowledge, which is divided into four broad areas:</p> <ul>    <li>Ethics and Professional Standards</li>    <li>Investment Tools</li>    <li>Asset Classes</li>    <li>Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning</li> </ul> <p>The Level I exam is held twice a year, in June and December, at a number of test centres around the globe. At Level I, the exam consists of two 3-hour multiple choice papers, each containing 120 questions, which are both taken on the same day. The exams are administered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/draft/72014/www.cfainstitute.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">CFA Institute</a>, the leading global&nbsp;association of investment professionals, who recommend candidates spend a minimum of 300 hours preparing for each Level.<br><br>The exam consists of 240 multiple choice questions, which have three possible answers (A, B or C), and stand alone from each other. All questions are equally weighted, and there are no penalties for guessing an answer or getting one wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>CFA Institute designs the curriculum books to deliver what it calls the &#039;Candidate Body of Knowledge&#039; (CBOK). The curriculum at Level I is organised into 18 study sessions, and 67 assigned readings. Each reading has specific learning outcome statements (LOS) assigned to it. When studying, you should keep referring to the LOS in your curriculum books, so that you are confident you&#039;re covering everything you need to know.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <p><strong>To take the CFA Level I exam:<br></strong></p> <p><strong>1.
