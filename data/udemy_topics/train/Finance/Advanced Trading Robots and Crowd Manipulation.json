It has over 13,000 students and 300 reviews. If you have not taken that course, do check it out first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Huh? What is a Trading Robot?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A Trading Robot a set of programming codes that analyses and trade the market on its own. Trading Robots allow you to trade the markets without human intervention!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What does this course offer?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course teaches the insider knowledge to designing, testing and coding long term profitable robots. We do NOT promise that you will strike it rich overnight. We do not make ridiculous claims (like those you see in newspapers and online ads) that you will make $3722 every night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course WILL, however, offer you the years of experience we have in building Robots. You will understand the pitfalls and keys to success to design great robots. You will avoid the hundreds of mistakes we made in my journey.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course does not only teach programming. Programming is just the tool we use to execute our ideas. The main essence of the course is the design theories behind the Trading Robots. These theories and knowledge come from years of industry practice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day you will acquire the ability to generate a trading idea, code the idea (within 1hour), test the idea, see the strength and flaws in the idea, improve and finally execute the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Chapters - Full List (These are Sections NOT Lectures!)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">&lt;Course 1: Black Algo Trading – Build Your Trading Robot&gt;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Here's What You Are In For!</li><li>Programming Basics 1: Variables and Conditional</li><li>Robot 1: Adeline - Our First Robot!</li><li>Uncommon Common Sense.
