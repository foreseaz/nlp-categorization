You will be able to talk with confidence about your new bookkeeping and accounting knowledge and will earn respect for it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t You will know your ‘gross profit’ from your ‘net profit’, your ‘cost of goods’ from your ‘operating capital’, your ‘depreciation’ from your ‘amortization’ but BEST OF ALL you will CLEARLY understand the logic behind these things in a way that no other course has EVER explained.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Why is a ‘credit’ a credit. Why do so many people get credits and debits mixed up. The single guaranteed way never to get them wrong again (just knowing that is worth the price of admission – never get stuck in an exam again!).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAnd you get our special mini-course on starting your own bookkeeping service.  </p>",
