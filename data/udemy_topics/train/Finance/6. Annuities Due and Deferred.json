    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This short course discusses how the present and future value of annuities are affected when the payments are made in advance of the interest periods (i.e. at the beginning of each period), instead of at the end of the periods.  We will also discuss deferred annuities which are the result of postponing the first annuity payment by more than one interest period.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    With this course, you will receive a comprehensive set of course notes and examples which will be covered with the video lectures.  The course might take you 3-4 days to complete although this will vary among students.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you are interested in mathematics of finance and would like to study these topics in more depth, then this is an excellent introduction to the formulas used with annuities and how to solve finance problems.  </p>",
