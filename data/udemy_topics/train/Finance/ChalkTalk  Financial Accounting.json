Chalk Talk: Accounting is here to get you up to speed on the basics of accounting, but not with boring lectures.  Instead, Chalk Talk: Accounting uses visuals/drawings with audio to help you see how accounting truly works. The course can take as little as three hours in one sitting or you watch the videos one a day for 2-3 minutes and it will take you three months.\r\n</p>",
