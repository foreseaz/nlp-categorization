    "description": "<p>In the world we live in, most of us have too much student debt, too little income, maxed out credit cards and a 401k that derives most its growth from our contributions rather than from actual investment returns. For us, there is one simple question... Are there investment opportunities out there that will help me catch up? We aren't accredited investors (annual income of $250k+ or net worth of $1M+). We don't have the cash to invest in hedge funds, venture capital, private equity or even flip a property. We have flashes of disposable income that often go toward home improvements, our children or our own peace of mind. We are \"Everyday Investors\".<br></p>\n\n<p>Crowd-funding, Peer-to-Peer Lending, Venture Sponsorship Entities, e-REITs, Social Investment Networks... These are all concepts that we should have at least a basic understanding of. None of the above mentioned opportunities will make us billionaires (though I should never say never), however, with the right mix of wisdom, strategy and discipline, they can significantly work in our financial favor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course uses a pure \"Talking Head\" lecture format to take students through an intermediate look at many of the emerging alternative investment options available to anyone with a laptop and internet access. </p>",
