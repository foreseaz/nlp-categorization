Throughout my years of teaching, my students complain that most professors just don't teach with the student in mind. They have the accounting expertise but can't properly convey the material in easily understood terms. That's where I come in. I will teach you the essentials of accounting. No fluff. I use fun analogies to help break down tricky accounting concepts into bite sized, manageable material. </p>\n\n<p>This course covers the importance of accounting principles and allows professionals to become more <strong>proficient at reading, understanding and interpreting financial statements.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Beginning with accounting basics, we will explore the importance of communication and purpose of financial statements. From there, you will learn how to <strong>Create an Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement</strong> in excel.  Then I will introduce you to financial ratios and how they are used to interpret those tricky numbers on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. Wrapping up, we will explore a real world company using Yahoo Finance so you can learn exactly how each statement connects together. </p>\n\n<p>This is a wonderful course for anyone wanting to learn the basics of accounting and how to read financial statements. </p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What Materials are Included in this Course?</strong><br></p>\n\n<ul><li>Multiple Quizzes to Test your Knowledge</li><li>Engaging Video Lectures</li><li>Useful Excel Practice Examples</li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Questions this Course Answers?</strong><br></p>\n\n<ul><li>How to Read Financial Statements?</li><li>What is Accounting?</li><li>How to Invest Smarter?</li><li>How to Use Financial Ratios to Assess Companyâ€™s Financial Health?</li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>My Promise to You</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>In all honestly, I love to teach.
