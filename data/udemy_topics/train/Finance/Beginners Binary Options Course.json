The course is designed for the beginner who wants to learn what binary options are and how to trade them.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    All you need to have for this course is an interest in binary options and we will do the rest.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    This entry level course is a series of 14 videos which roughly go for about 10 minutes each.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    We structured the course so each lesson builds upon the previous one so we advise to start from lesson one and continue through each respective lecture.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    We recommend taking our course because its free (unlike many courses which charge thousands of dollars) and you will gain more knowledge on what binary options plus how to trade them.  </p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
