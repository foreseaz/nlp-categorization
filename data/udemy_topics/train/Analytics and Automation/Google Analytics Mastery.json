The secret is to know what&#039;s working, and not be distracted one bit by all the blinking new channels, tools, and sites that beg for your attention.</p>    <p style=\"\">Most people in business can get some traffic to their website, typically spend some time on Facebook or Twitter or any of the many social media sites available to them, and may do some basic search engine optimization. But when it comes to being “successful online&quot;, most don&#039;t have the time or direction to know where and what to focus on. So we try to do it all – “jack of all trades, master of none&quot;</p>    <p style=\"\">Look. Everyone has access to Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, blah blah blah. The fact is your customers are really there too. They&#039;re searching on Google, they&#039;re hanging out on Facebook. So why then do most businesses just spin their wheels and flounder around in search of success?</p>    <p style=\"\">Think of it this way – anyone can own a set of golf clubs. Typically there&#039;s an assortment of 10 or more clubs in the bag – and you can whack the little dimpled thing with any one of those clubs.</p>    <p style=\"\">But to play golf well…to be a master of the game and make the ball go exactly where you want it to go…then you need to know what clubs to use and when. You need to know when the #7 club will put you within inches of your goal where #8 or 9 will leave you in the rough, lost in the sea of all the other golfers.</p>    <p style=\"\">… you need the inside secrets you will not discover casually on your own.</p>    <p style=\"\">It&#039;s the same with analysis.</p>    <p style=\"\">The advanced, mega powerful secrets do not appear to you magically, just because now you&#039;re in the position of having to sell something.
