This course systematically prepares anyone interested in diversity and multiculturalism with important skills to make their environments more inclusive, safe, productive, and connected.</p>\n\n<p>Concepts covered include the cultural, historical, and philosophical foundations of education in a multicultural society. We begin by outlining  the principles of multicultural education, before looking at the connections between issues such as race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also cover less addressed issues of diversity such as language, geography, religion, and the youth culture. Optional discussions, activities, and a range of additional readings deepen the learning so that anyone taking the class can put the ideas into practice right away.</p>",
