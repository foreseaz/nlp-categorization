    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Understanding job requirements, defining work and employer expectations allows for better performance, increased satisfaction of accomplishments and retaining talent in the business. While performance expectations are established in company handbooks, being able to draw out employee expectations is a newly required skill for managers, demanding communicating articulately clearly defined set of presuppositions, setting specific measurable goals, agreeing on progress evaluation dates, being resourceful about alternatives, and avoiding third hand information and innuendos. Following open door policy, praising publicly and criticizing privately, considering contingencies, using feedback surveys and behavioural profiles to raise employee self-awareness, encouraging open, constructive dialogues are dynamic tools for clarifying employee expectations.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \t</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">The course include the following video topics:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  1.
