    "description": "<p>HR leaders know they need an analytics savvy department, and HR pros (even those who went into HR because they liked people not stats) know they need at least the fundamental analytics skills.</p><p>Most HR functions have found progress in analytics slow going; and when they read about Google's HR team doing something amazing with Big Data it doesn't seem relevant to their world.</p><p>This course gets right to the little known, I'd even say \"secret\", fundamentals of how to be analytics savvy. It focuses on what the average HR person can do within the constraints of time, technology, budget and their existing skill set.  Part of this is to frame analytics as part of  evidence-based management.</p><p>It's a one hour course broken up into digestible two-four minute modules so it is easy to fit into your schedule<br></p>",
