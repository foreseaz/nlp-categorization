You&#039;ll need to learn how to hire the best people, develop them into leaders, and keep them working for your organization.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  Human Resources isn&#039;t just a department in your business -- it is the heart and soul of your business!  You can&#039;t succeed if you don&#039;t understand exactly how to pick the best team.  Here&#039;s what we&#039;ll go over:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Optimized <strong style=\"\">Talent Acquisition</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Performance Management</strong> unleashed</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Engagement and Retention</strong> unleashed</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Continuous Learning</strong> unleashed</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Global Leadership </strong>unleashed</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Big Data and Analytics</strong> unleashed</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t                    If you are happy with old-school theories of people management, then this course is not for you.  If you are content with an average workforce, then this course is not for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                  But if you&#039;re trying to make your employees the best they can be possibly be, your team the best it can possibly be, and your company the best in the game, then this course <strong style=\"\">is</strong> for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What&#039;s included in the course?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                In addition to the videos going over the 6 main topics above, you&#039;ll see Powerpoint Slides in a split-screen Mashup to follow along with all of my points.  I highly recommend watching the course in the &quot;full screen&quot; view -- you&#039;ll be able to see the slides in much more detail.  I&#039;ve also included the full Powerpoint Slide Deck in the form of a PDF you can download and look at for more information (some of the slides are quite dense!).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                As a bonus, I&#039;ve also included links to my favorite resources for each section -- find these in the supplemental materials section of the lectures.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Now....Let&#039;s get started!  </p>",
