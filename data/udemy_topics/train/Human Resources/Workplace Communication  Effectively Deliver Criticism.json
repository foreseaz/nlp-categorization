    "description": "<p>  \t  Imagine being able to give employees, colleagues and clients constructive criticism in the workplace, and they follow your advice, and actually appreciate your insights. Wouldn&#039;t it be nice to know that you can deliver criticism to colleagues in the workplace and they will take your criticism to heart and feel better about you in the process?  </p>  <p>  \t  In this How to Deliver Criticism in the Workplace course, you will learn the following:  </p>  <p>  \t  *How to avoid the common blunders other people make when delivering criticism in the workplace  </p>  <p>  \t  *How to build trust first with colleagues  </p>  <p>  \t  *How to make your criticism seem objective and credible  </p>  <p>  \t  *How to package your criticism so that it will be acted upon  </p>  <p>  \t  This course is delivered primarily through spoken lecture. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.  </p>  <p>  \t  The skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself.
