    "description": "<p>We have all heard the concept, “Dress for Success” but, \nunfortunately, this overused saying has caused more harm than good, \nsteering many women to dress less successful and more predictable. \nInstead, Bridgette Raes believes that successful dressing comes from the\n simple belief that:\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>In order to be successful, you have to FEEL successful in what you wear.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<li>Have you turned ever down offers, plans, or engagements because you felt your image didn’t best reflect you? </li><li>Have you ever felt misjudged by others because of your image or personal style?</li><li>Have you ever worked too hard to overcompensate for the fact that <br>your image and style at work didn’t reflect how intelligent, capable and<br> powerful you are?</li><li>Have you ever passed up plans or events simply because you didn’t have the right thing to wear?</li>\n\n<p>Working within the parameters of appropriateness in \nthe workplace, Bridgette Raes uses this course to show you how you can \ninfuse your personality into your wardrobe, feel successful in what you \nwear and take your style and, most importantly, your career to the next \nlevel.\n</p>\n\n<p> <br>\n</p>",
