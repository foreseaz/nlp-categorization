    "description": "<p>I’ll show you \nhow to make your photos leap out of your computer screen with eye \npopping colours, sharpness and clarity in these 25 HD Photoshop tutorials. Rather than \nfacing one huge video tutorial, I’ve broken everything down into 25 mini\n video tutorials, so if you’d like to repeatedly watch the video just \nabout ‘sharpening’ for example, you can get to it easily and quickly.</p><p>Most photographers use either Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Camera Raw/Photoshop to process their RAW files.</p><p>In these videos I regularly switch between both of these platforms to show you the differences in the interfaces even though all of the tools we use are identical.</p><p>Both Adobe \nLightroom and ACR (in Photoshop) have the same tools and functionality \nso it doesn’t matter which of these apps you prefer when it comes to RAW\n file processing. The steps we take will be the same.<br></p><p><strong>Here’s What You’ll Learn</strong></p><ul><li>Opening Files in Adobe Camera RAW</li><li>Opening Files in Lightroom</li><li>Setting up Your Lightroom Workspace</li><li>Setting your RAW Defaults</li><li>Setting your Colour Space</li><li>Camera Calibration Settings</li><li>Sharpening</li><li>Chromatic Aberration</li><li>Lens Correction</li><li>White Balance</li><li>Setting Your Black and White Points</li><li>Using the Tone Curve for Contrast Adjustment</li><li>Using the Straighten Tool</li><li>Spot Removal</li><li>Noise Reduction</li><li>Graduated Filters</li><li>Radial Filters</li><li>Hue – Saturation – Luminance</li><li>Adjustment Brushes</li><li>Saving as a TIFF in Photoshop</li><li>Saving as a TIFF in Lightroom</li><li>Saving for Web in Photoshop</li><li>Saving for Web in Lightroom</li></ul><p><strong>RAW Files Included</strong></p><p>I’ve included two RAW files that were hand picked for their glorious \nimperfections. These files require some correction and enhancement that \nperfectly demonstrates my typical RAW processing workflow.</p><p>You can follow along with your own computer and process the images in\n tandem with the tutorials. Through repetition you’ll become adept at \nthis RAW processing workflow.</p><p><strong>System Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Either a Windows PC or a Mac Computer</li><li>Up to date copy of Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Photoshop with the latest version of ACR</li><li>Adobe Bridge (not essential but highly recommended)</li></ul>",
