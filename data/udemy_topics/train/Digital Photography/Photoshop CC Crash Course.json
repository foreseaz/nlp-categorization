This course starts by going over those concepts and then shows how to combine them for powerful results. </p><p>Rather than showing you every single feature, this course focuses on the features people actually use without boring you to tears on the other tools. </p><p>The instructor Jeremy Shuback has taught over 150,000 people Photoshop and works as a professional designer. He uses Photoshop every day to create everything from billboards to photorealistic matte paintings for feature films. </p><p>More importantly, he understands that you don&#039;t want to spend 14 hours straight trying to learn Photoshop.</p>",
