    "description": "<p style=\"\">With this photography video workshop, master photographer Tony Sweet teaches the art of high dynamic range (HDR) photography, one of the hottest new techniques in digital photography. HDR photography captures a wider dynamic range than traditional photography is able to achieve. The technique uses a series of exposures at varying levels, and combines them with HDR software (Photomatix). The results range from hyperrealism to surrealism. Shot on location at Eastern State Penitentiary, “HDR Photography Made Easy” simplifies the steps of fine-tuning exposures in capture, merging with HDR software, and tone mapping the final image. Ten compositions with a range of tonal challenges are set up, captured, and processed. The program covers traditional, Pseudo HDR, and double-image processing as well as Tony’s favorite finishing techniques in Photoshop. “HDR Photography Made Easy” will have you creating your own amazing HDR images in no time.<br style=\"\"></p>",
