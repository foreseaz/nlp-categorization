A series of projects cover the spectrum of modern editing techniques - enhancing, retouching, restoring damaged photos, recoloring vintage photos, beauty techniques, artistic effects, emulate the look of famous photographers, get the designer look you see coming out of photography studios - the list goes on. </p><p>This course is aimed at people who know the basics (although the very basic need to know stuff is covered in a tutorial early on in the course.) The Little Box of Tricks takes a project based approach. Over 8.5 hours, 50 videos and over 25 projects take you through a kaleidoscope of technique. Resources are included when needed, and as well as telling you which buttons to press, I'll tell you <em>why</em> to do things a certain way, along with a few gotchas to watch out for.</p><p>You've chosen a good platform with Affinity Photo. Now let me give you some of my 25+ years experience as a designer. Learn pro techniques, Learn pro practices. Get the pro look.</p>",
