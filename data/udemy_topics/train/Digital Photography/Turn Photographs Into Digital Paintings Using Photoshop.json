Step by step, I break down all the things you need to know and understand in Photoshop to move your images out of a photographic appearance into a more painterly one.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Although, I do break everything into simple steps a basic understanding of the program is suggested.

In one lecture I even show you how to find royalty free stock sites where you can download stunning photographs to paint from.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                      Included in the course are 60+ lectures, and almost 6 hours of in-depth video training. There are 3 practice sessions, where you can watch me paint as I go over everything I&#039;m doing, step by step.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In the supplemental material sections, I have included the images I use throughout the course for you to download and practice along side me, but you will learn the skills needed to create a painting out of ANY image.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Enroll today, I&#039;d love to help you learn this fun way to create art!  </p>",
