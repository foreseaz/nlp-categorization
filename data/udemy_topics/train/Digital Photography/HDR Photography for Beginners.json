    "description": "<p>HDR stands for High Dynamic Range and refers to scenes that include both bright and dark elements. It may be the sun, reflecting on water with some dark shadows in the tree lines, or a person standing in front the glare of an open window. When taking photographs of scenes like these, unlike the human eye, cameras need typically a little extra help to get that done. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn To Shoot And Process HDR Photographs Like The Pros!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>HDR photography is traditionally done by taking multiple photos of with the exact same composition but with different exposure settings and then merging them all together as one photo.
