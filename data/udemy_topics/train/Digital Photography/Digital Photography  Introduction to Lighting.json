    "description": "<p>  \t  If you&#039;re anything like I was when I started photographing professionally nearly 10-years ago, you&#039;re intimidated to try out external lighting for your photography. I almost let fear win, but then I learned: &quot;It&#039;s just light.&quot;  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course I will help you transform your understanding and thinking about lighting for your photography through video lectures, images reviews, course downloads, and assignments throughout designed to integrate your learning.  </p>  <p>  \t  Students will walk through the course by covering the basic types and qualities of lighting, including sample photos of each along the way.  </p>  <p>  \t  Designed to be complete over the weekend you can complete the course as fast or slow as you like - while working on your lighting knowledge and skills independently in between sections.  </p>  <p>  \t  Take this course if you want to free yourself of the fear of lighting, or if you&#039;re looking to incorporate something new and exciting in your photography! Liberate yourself and take advantage of all that photography has to offer through learning about lighting&#039;s options, uses, and functions.  </p>",
