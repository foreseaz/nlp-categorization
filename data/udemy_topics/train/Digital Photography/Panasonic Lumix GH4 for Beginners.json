Even if you&#039;ve never used a DSLR before, this course will work to build your understanding of both the camera and general photography from the ground up.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis is a relatively short course â€“ about four and a half hours is all it takes to become a master with this camera. Lectures are 100% easy-to-follow videos, with plenty of clear diagrams that will construct your understanding of the camera dynamically.  </p>",
