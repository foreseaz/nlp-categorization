    "description": "<p>  \t    This course is one course of a complete package of courses that is specialized in answering (Cambridge IGCSE Physics past papers)  </p>  <p>  \t    The course is continuously growing, started with 50 questions, and adding more questions as much as we can,  </p>  <p>  \t    The package also includes other courses:  </p>  <p>  \t    IGCSE Mechanics past papers questions  </p>  <p>  \t    IGCSE Thermal Physics past papers questions  </p>  <p>  \t    IGCSE Atomic Physics past papers questions  </p>  <p>  \t    IGCSE Waves past papers questions  </p>  <p>  \t    I can never imagine a Cambridge IGCSE Physics student who did not:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p>  \t\t    1-Answer these past papers questions,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    2-Understand how to read the mark scheme of these questions,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    3-Know how to write a full understandable scientific answer for these questions,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    4-Know the marks distribution among the full answer according to the mark scheme,  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t    There are many differences between watching science for fun or general knowledge, and studying science for an exam,  </p>  <p>  \t    If you are aiming for an A* or A, reading the books and watching videos to explain the syllabus, are not enough,  </p>  <p>  \t    You must understand those people who will correct your paper,  </p>  <p>  \t    Sometimes you understand things, but you are unable to express and explain what is in your mind,  </p>  <p>  \t    That is why understanding your syllabus perfectly and strongly is not enough,  </p>  <p>  \t    This is only 40% of the road to the A*,  </p>  <p>  \t    You must communicate with the minds of the examiners through answering past papers, understanding mark schemes which include the answer they would love to hear from you,  </p>  <p>  \t    This is 60% of the road,  </p>  <p>  \t    You must choose the courses that are related to your syllabus, not just (physics syllabus),  </p>  <p>  \t    Most of videos on the internet may include what you need in your syllabus, but they also include a lot of thing that you do not need,  </p>  <p>  \t    From 9 to 12 courses, realized this fact,  </p>  <p>  \t    That is why their courses are specialized in answering past papers for each specific syllabus and not general past papers,  </p>  <p>  \t    Each question will be answered in the following steps:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p>  \t\t    1-The teacher reads the question with loud and clear voice,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    2-3 seconds chance to pause the video so you read it again carefully and try  can answer the question yourself in your notebook â€“ if you want-  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    3-If you did not pause the video, the countdown ends and the teacher starts to explain the question, giving a quick express revision on the points related to this question in an average of 1 minute,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    4-The teacher gives you the final answer,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    5-The mark scheme is displayed on the screen, and the teacher starts to explain the mark scheme and gives any other possible answers,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    6-The teacher compares the mark scheme with his answer and shows you what are the marks of the question given for and how his answer gets the full mark of the question,  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t    7-All these steps for each question take an average duration of 2 minute for each question.  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t    Again whether you take them with us or in any other place I can never imagine a Cambridge IGCSE Physics student who goes to the final exam without understanding these questions,  </p>  <p>  \t    I hope you enjoy and benefit.  </p>",
