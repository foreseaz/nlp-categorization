S. Eliot.&nbsp; We will focus mainly on classic works such as The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men, but we may also take up some less prominent poems as well.&nbsp; Toward this end we shall also consider some aspects of Eliot&#039;s biography, his literary criticism, and the cultural backdrop of his times.&nbsp; Our final objective will be to clarify not only Eliot&#039;s poems but the revolution in twentieth century poetry largely attributed to Eliot and his cohort Ezra Pound.</span></p>  <p style=\"\">See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://video.nbc17.com/v/52072548/the-faculty-project.htm?q=Victor+Strandberg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Prof. Strandberg on NBC17</a></p>",
