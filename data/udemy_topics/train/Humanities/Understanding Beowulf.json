    "description": "<p>\r\n\t The classic literary tale “Beowulf” comes to life in this course from Providence eLearning. William Lasseter provides narration and commentary throughout the text in 25 video lectures. The poem emerges from Anglo-Saxon oral tradition, composed by an Anonymous scop, or bard, in the 7th century and written down sometime around the 10th century. The 10th century scribes (for there were two) from whose hands we have received the manuscript fell into not a few errors of ignorance, arising apparently from their imperfectly understanding what they were writing.\r\n</p>",
