Throughout the past two thousand years, these two lands, though separated by the Irish Sea, have nonetheless shared many triumphs and woes. The course will provide a basis for students to understand the complex relationship between these two Celtic nations. Changing Lands and Faiths begins with the life of the most well-known figure in Irish history, Saint Patrick, and follows the path of his faith from Ireland into Scotland.  Old peoples such as the Picts and new peoples such as the Saxons and the Scandinavian raiders known as Vikings will leave their mark upon the lands of the Celts and will be discussed in turn.  </p>",
