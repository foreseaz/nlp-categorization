    "description": "<p>Professors from the University of New England were surveyed to find the most common problems in undergraduate writing. The inability to paraphrase ideas and the failure to express ones ideas were found to be common problems (Garret, n.d.). It is possible that these common problems are not being directly addressed. When I transitioned from high school to college, I also struggled with paraphrasing. I didn&#039;t really understand what paraphrasing was or how to paraphrase in an effective manner. Because of my struggles, my grades suffered and I believed that I was a terrible writer. My English Composition 101 professor encouraged me that I was an excellent writer, but I needed a better understanding of paraphrasing. She gave me the confidence boost that I needed. I tried to figure out an effective way to paraphrase. I graduated Summa cum Laude! I recently graduated with distinction with a Master of Science Degree in General Psychology. Now, I would like to share what I learned to help you paraphrase effectively. This course directly gives strategies to paraphrase ideas and also to express ideas in one&#039;s own voice and style.</p><p>After completing this course you will be able to:</p> <ul style=\"\"><li>Chart, sketch, or write a personal definition of paraphrasing</li> <li>Learn how to paraphrase</li> <li>Evaluate if a paraphrase needs revision</li> <li>Paraphrase ideas that relate to an academic assignment</li> <li>Gain control and confidence with paraphrasing sources on academic assignments</li></ul> <p>Why is paraphrasing important? </p> <ul style=\"\"><li>In academic writing, you need to be able to paraphrase reliable sources. </li> <li>Paraphrasing shows your professor that you understood what you read.</li> <li>If you do not paraphrase ideas, you may be plagiarizing. Plagiarizing is stealing an author&#039;s ideas and using them as your own. </li> <li>Penalties for plagiarizing can vary from having to redo an assignment to being dismissed from the college or university.</li></ul> <p>References</p><p>Garret, J.
