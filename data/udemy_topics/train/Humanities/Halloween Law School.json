    "description": "<p style=\"\">What might happen if someone sold a house to you and you didn't know that it was haunted? Or what if your neighbor decided to write your epitaph on a tombstone that he used for a Halloween yard decoration? Or what if someone took the vampire character too far in actually drinking blood from a victim? What if you got so frightened in a haunted house party that you broke your leg when you tried to escape? All of these fascinating questions span subject areas of law which will earn you graduation from Halloween Law School if you make it through the course.</p><p style=\"\">If you dare to attend Halloween Law School, you will get a sense of what it takes to go to the first year of law school (in the U.S.). Hogwarts might teach you to be a wizard, but the Halloween Law School course will prepare you for the scariest night of the year. You will learn some legaleze along the way, and learn a bit about a lawyer's brain without ever having to take it out! This course will conjure up real law cases in every subject of the first year of law school for you and leave you frightfully ready to deal with any case from the crypt.</p>",
