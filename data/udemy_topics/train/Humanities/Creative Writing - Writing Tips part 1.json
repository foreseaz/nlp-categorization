Terminology is simple, ideal for those for whom English is a second language.</p><p>Depending upon the student&#039;s timeframe, the course, without pausing, lasts just under an hour and a half. If completing one tip with its exercises per day, the course could last a month, or at one exercise per day, this course contains three months&#039; worth of content.</p><p>No specific materials are required other than pen / pencil and paper or blank document. All slides and mentioned handouts are provided as downloadable documents.</p><p>If you have no prior creative writing knowledge, this course will provide a strong foundation on which to build a body of work. If you already have some knowledge, it will refresh those skills and improve your confidence going forward.</p><p>An accompanying &#039;part 2&#039; course provides 30 tips and 90+ exercises concentrating on the craft of writing and will enhance the skills learned from &#039;part 1&#039;.</p>",
