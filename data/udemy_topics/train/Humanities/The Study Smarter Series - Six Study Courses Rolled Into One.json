    "description": "<p>I designed this course to turn you into a trained, efficient, professional student. You will learn skills that will matter throughout your entire life, both at work and in your private life. But most importantly, if you master these skills, you will make it through your freshman year.</p>\n<p>The course is actually six short courses bundled together into one longer course. If you are only interested in taking one of the topics you will find it listed as a separate course. The course titles are:</p><p>Managing Your Time</p><p>Taking Better Notes</p><p>Reading Textbooks Efficiently</p><p>Building Your Vocabulary</p><p>Taking Tests Effectively, and<br></p><p>Sharpening Your Memory</p>\n<p>Each course consists of five Power Point lectures and a student packet. Ideally you will print the student packet for each topic. During the lectures, I will refer to the student packets, which contain exercises and examples. You need to put the principles in the lectures into practice in the student packets.</p>",
