    "description": "<p>This course covers the military and political contexts of the Battle of Gettysburg. In five video lectures, roughly an hour in total, the course will situate students in the American Civil War during the early summer of 1863. They will learn a military landscape leading up to and including the Gettysburg Campaign, and the delve into the three-day battle in greater detail. A final lecture will cover the aftermath of the battle and how the legacy of the fight continues to shape our understanding of the Civil War today. Each lecture is accompanied by a helpful and downloadable list of key terms. While there is no reading required for this course, I have provided a brief list of suggested readings, for those who want to dig deeper into detail. </p><p>High school and college students, history buffs, people planning a visit to the battlefield, and anyone with even a passing interest in Civil War history should find this course rewarding. I encourage all students to take an active and engaged role - and reach out to me personally via this platform and social media. This is the future of education, friends - let's talk :) <br></p><p><br> </p>",
