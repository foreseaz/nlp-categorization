    "description": "<p>This course covers the Reconstruction Era - 1862 to 1877. It consists of 17 lectures averaging 15 minutes each that engage the historical narrative as well as political, social, and economic themes. I have supplemented each lecture with a list of key terms and an assortment of primary sources...you can read for yourself what the historical actors were saying as you follow along. I designed this course especially for history students (high school/AP and college undergrads) but anyone with an interest in this most contentious and complicated period of US history will find this course useful and engaging. My students tend to enjoy my colloquial teaching style and - in addition - I invite anyone who wants to take the conversation further to reach out to me personally here or any other social media platform. </p>",
