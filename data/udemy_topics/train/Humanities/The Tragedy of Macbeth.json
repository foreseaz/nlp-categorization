    "description": "<p></p><p>Written sometime around 1604, &quot;<strong>Macbeth</strong>&quot; is set in Scotland&nbsp;<span>and tells the tale of one man&#039;s disastrous ambition. Commonly&nbsp;</span><span>referred to as &quot;the cursed play&quot; or &quot;the Scottish&quot; play, it is&nbsp;</span><span>notorious in the drama world not just for being Shakespeare&#039;s&nbsp;</span><span>shortest tragedy but also for having various sinister superstitions&nbsp;</span><span>attached to it. Such superstitions may have sprung from the&nbsp;</span><span>subject matter of the play which includes betrayal, regicide,&nbsp;</span><span>infanticide, murder and death. Despite such dark themes,</span><span>&quot;Macbeth&quot; has gained a reputation for its startling depiction of&nbsp;</span><span>the darkness of a soul committing itself to hell and remains one&nbsp;</span><span>of Shakespeare&#039;s greatest and most oft-performed plays.</span></p><p>In this course you will learn to understand great Shakespearean literature like never before through video analysis that compliments the included full text and audio narration.</p><p></p>\r\n",
