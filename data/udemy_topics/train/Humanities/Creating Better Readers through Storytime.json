In this course, you will learn how to teach reading skills through a children&#039;s storybook.  You probably already read to your child at home.  Now you can learn how to incorporate simple yet effective lessons in phonological awareness, word recognition, vocabulary, and comprehension.  </p><p style=\"\">Working on reading skills for just a few minutes a day can have a major impact on your child&#039;s reading abilities.  This course is designed to help you create reading activities and lessons at each stage of the reading process; before, during, and after.  Each stage of reading offers opportunities for you to engage children in the story, teach critical thinking skills, increase their knowledge of words, and how to respond to what they have just read.  </p><p style=\"\">This course is structured so that you learn the basic elements of reading instruction, the best practices for reading, and why it is so important to read to children.  </p>",
