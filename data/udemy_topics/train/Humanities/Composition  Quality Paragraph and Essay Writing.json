This is perfect for students already enrolled in a composition course who might need extra help, or for students and employees who might need a refresher after time away from writing practice.  The course follows the writing process taught in most high school and graduate composition courses: prewriting and brainstorming, organizing and outlining, drafting, revising and editing, and formatting.</p>",
