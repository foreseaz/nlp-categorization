    "description": "<p>  \tOver the years, I&#039;ve taught many different kinds of classics courses to all kinds of different audiences. This class on Udemy is a distillation of the topics that students have responded to most positively and have most often asked about. We start with a look at the physical world of the Greeks, and then take up the Iliad of Homer. After that we look in detail how Herodotus presents the beginning of the great conflict between Greece and Persian, and finish up with an overview of the various Greek philosophers.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you&#039;re taking a class in Greek culture somewhere and need a little help, or if you are a motivated autodidact, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find these lectures a good step forward in your understanding and appreciation of the world of the Greeks.  </p>  <p>  \tThanks for having a look!  </p>  <p>  \t-bl  </p>",
