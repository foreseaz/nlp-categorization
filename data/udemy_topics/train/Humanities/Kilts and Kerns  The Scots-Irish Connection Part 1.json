    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    Both Scotland and Ireland possess common roots of language, culture, and tradition.  Throughout the past two thousand years, these two lands, though separated by the Irish Sea, have nonetheless shared many triumphs and woes.  As the centuries passed, mercenaries, settlers, and entire clans moved back and forth between Scotland and Ireland, weaving together the tales of these two peoples.  The course will provide a basis for students to understand the complex relationship between these two Celtic nations.  The lessons in Part 1 will cover the interactions of the Irish Scots with groups such as the Picts and Romans, the Kingdom of Dalriadaâ€™s rise and fall, Iron Age Celtic society, and the impacts of various invaders into the Celtic lands of the British Isles.  </p>",
