    "description": "<p>Donald Trump is not the first candidate of his kind. While nobody had quite his celebrity or combover, Trump  is part\nof a populist strain in American politics that is centuries old. This\nstrain of American politics goes back to the Lyndon Johnsons, Wendell\nWilkies, and Huey Longs of the 20<sup>th</sup>\ncentury. It stretches back to the William Jennings Bryans or even the\nAndrew Jacksons of the 19<sup>th</sup>\ncentury. In fact, most historians and political aficionados –\nwhatever they think of the Donald – think candidates like him are\nas old as the United States itself. \n</p><p><strong>In this course you will learn about other Donald Trumps in American history, such as</strong></p><ul><li>Andrew Jackson, who fought over 100 duels and was hated by elite society</li><li>William Jennings Bryan, the fiery populist who threatened to overturn America's financial system</li><li>Huey Long, the eccentric governor who promised socialism and gave his best speeches drunk</li></ul><p>This course is divided into eight video lectures. It explains the reasons for Trump's campaign success, then finds other politicians in American history who fit that mold. By looking at their political fates we will be able to better guess the future of the Donald Trump campaign. </p>",
