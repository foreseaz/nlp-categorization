    "description": "<p>Explore classic British Literature like never before in this course covering the timeless Arthurian tale &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.” An anonymous poet wrote the alliterative verse poem in Middle English in the 14th century. &nbsp;This course includes more than 40 videos analyzing the work throughout, and also includes audio narration and review questions.&nbsp; Rich in language and symbolism, the poem tells the tale of a young knight of King Arthur’s Camelot, Gawain, who accepts the challenge to trade blows with a seemingly invincible opponent.&nbsp; Gawain’s adherence to the code of chivalry allows him to overcome the pitfalls of temptation, and eventually allow him to survive the terror of death. The classical literature explained in this course does not simply give students an insight into a classic text, it will open up a new perspective with which to view other works in the future.<br></p>\r\n",
