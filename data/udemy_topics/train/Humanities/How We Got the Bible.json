This course does not address the contents of the Bible but rather examines the earliest records we have of Biblical literature and how the Bible has passed through a number of different cultures, copies and translations.  The course takes an academic approach to the subject of the Bible and strives to give the student an appreciation of the monumental road that it has traveled in order to be available to the faith community and general public today.  The course will look at ancient &quot;targhums&quot;, archaic translations and contemporary translations to provide to the student an indepth understanding of why the Bible is so highly regarded by so many people.  </p>",
