    "description": "<p>  \tThis course is about the Western Front during World War I. The course consists of 8 lectures of reasonable size so it should only take an hour or two of your time to complete it. The course is structured in chronological order starting in Pre-War Europe leading all the way to the end of the war and the year 1919. Students should take this course if they have an interest in World War I and are wishing to learn about the battles and soldiers experiences on the Western Front. It will give them an appreciation for the world we live in now and for the courage these young men and women faced during this horrendous time. I will keep this course in an easy to understand format to not lose anyone along the way. The only materials a student will need is a program that can play WMV files (which come on Windows computers).  </p>",
