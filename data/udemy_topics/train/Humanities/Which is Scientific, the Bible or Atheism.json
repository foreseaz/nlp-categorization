    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This is a trial course to introduce students to what they can expect if  they sign up for other Educate for Life classes.  This particular course  goes through four reasons belief in God is scientific and the lack of  belief in God is un-scientific.  The course includes follow along notes  and a voluntary ten question quiz at the end of the lesson.  The total  course is around 1 hour and consists of video lectures along with  detailed slide presentations.  This course is meant to dispel the idea  that belief in God is unscientific.  And to demonstrate that atheism is  not rational or scientific.  MORE CLASSES WILL BE AVAILABLE BY SEPTEMBER 2014.  </p>",
