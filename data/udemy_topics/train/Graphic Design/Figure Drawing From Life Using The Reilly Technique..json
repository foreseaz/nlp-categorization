    "description": "<p>This Frank Reilly method drawing  course in fifteen lectures covers the details of the \"Reilly\" drawing  technique and demonstrations using it. This technique allows for complete  figure drawings from life in less than 45 minutes. Starting with the lines of action  and large abstract shapes, the course proceeds through small shapes, negative  space, value, perspective, foreshortening, edge, line, details (face,  hands and feet), and drapery on the figure. The final two lectures summarize  the entire technique and give two examples using it to draw complete figures in  under five minutes by Reilly Method Drawing. There are also five complete demonstrations using this technique done in 4- 7 minutes of figures drawn from life in a variety of positions. The driving principal behind this course is that the \"whole is more important than the parts\" which is the reason that I start with a gesture drawing and build on its structure until completion with anatomy and details. Also, I cover how to apply drapery to the figure using the same principles.  </p>",
