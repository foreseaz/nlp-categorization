This is a practical method shared by a font designer with 35 years experience in typography and font design. Included is a sample font to get you started, discussions of concepts, and many practical demonstrations of the process of creating a font.  </p>  <p>  \t     If you have been wanting to design your own font, this course will give you a basic production procedure you can build into a workflow that fits your working style.  </p>  <p>  \t     The course materials will serve as a visual reference to complement the content of David&#039;s popular book, <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Practical Font Design Third Edition Plus</em></strong>. A downloadable PDF copy of the book is included with the course, plus a sample font you can use to start your new fonts. He will show you how to use the sample font.  </p>  <p>  \t   You can complete the course in a week or two, but the production of your first font will take several months up to nearly a year to complete.  </p>  <p>  \t   The course materials will remain a reference as you progress in your craft of font design.  </p>",
