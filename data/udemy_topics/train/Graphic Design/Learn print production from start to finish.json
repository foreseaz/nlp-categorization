If yes, this course is exactly what you&#039;re looking for. </p><p style=\"\">In this course you will understand how printing works and how all the variables in printing work together to create a great or bad print outcome. The outline for this course is going to start with an overview of the different printing and finishing processes with 3D animations, followed by thorough theory on the most important print topics, such as maximum ink coverage, page bleed, rasterization, what color models are and so on.</p><p style=\"\">After this, you are going to learn about color management and PDF for print production in-depth, followed by practical chapters that discover how you can put all those pieces together, including setting up print documents with InDesign, Illustrator, as well as optimizing your images with Photoshop and last but not least how to check those with preflights within Acrobat.</p>",
