    "description": "<p>In a nutshell Photoshop is the tool for improving how images look by removing unwanted details from them, improving their colours, exposure, contrast, sharpness and overall look. But it doesn’t stop there, as you can also combine images creating seamless compositions and even add animations, videos or 3D objects into your designs.<br></p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at anyone who wants to get into the creative industry and gain a rock solid foundation of Photoshop. Thanks to more than ten years of experience teaching Photoshop, Martin Perhiniak, Certified Adobe Expert and Instructor managed to formulate a course structure that is very comprehensive but still streamlined to make it easy to follow and digest. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Martin was voted to be one of the Top 10 Adobe instructors in the world by student feedback. Along the way besides the technical knowledge you need, Martin will also teach you a lot about design principles, compositional techniques and plenty of best practices that he picked up and developed while working as a designer and retoucher on projects such as Pixar’s Cars and Toy Story, BBC’s Dr Who or Mattel’s Team Hot Wheels.</p>",
