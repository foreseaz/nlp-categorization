    "description": "<p>This is a short but technical and detailed tutorial on how to convert an image graphic into an image map and successfully install it in a traditional website and a Wordpress site.</p><p>An image map is simply a graphic that has several, separately selected regions that link to external web pages.  It can be abstract (a set geometric shapes) or a real image, such as a picture of five family members.</p><p>Image maps make websites more interesting and engaging.  Rather than having a boring \"Click Here\" blue underlined hyperlink in your website, you can direct your visitors to the page you want by having them click an engaging image map; i.e. \"Click each person for his/her bio.\"</p><p>Creating image maps and getting them to work can be tricky and frustrating, but after you watch this tutorial, which teaches the concepts of <em>how image maps work</em> and not just how to make them, you should have no problem!</p>",
