    "description": "<p> <strong><em>\"I love this instructor!!</em></strong><em> Kristen Palana is phenomenal! She is truly an expert in her field, and teaches you exactly what you need to know. She breaks down complex issues into simple and understandable terms. On top of that, she is warm, friendly and personable. If you ever need anything, or have any questions she is always there for her students. I have taken several classes with her, and she is truly outstanding in each and every one!\" </em>-Dr. Nicola Kluge</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This quick and dirty course will help you make original, custom illustrations using Adobe Illustrator (or any similar program) in just a matter of minutes</strong> that look professional and can be used online, in videos and animations, or for print purposes such as on a poster, letterhead, even a T-shirt or other products. </p>\n\n<p>Please note that free 30 day trial versions of Illustrator are available for download from Adobe's website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Save money making your own illustrations (and stop paying others to do them for you) and develop skills that can help you start making money illustrating for others.</strong> You can also use these simple techniques to make unique illustrations as free gifts for friends and family.\n\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>You also don't need to know how to draw.</strong> There are actually a HUGE number of graphic designers who CAN NOT draw... but they make up for it by using techniques like the ones in this course and naturally, learning more about layout design, composition, color, typography, and other fundamentals of visual literacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can decide how much time you will spend on each illustration which will then affect your end results. As you do more and more, you can be cranking these out in a matter of minutes and could actually <strong>make a little illustration business creating these for others on websites like Fiverr, Elance, and other freelancing websites</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> I'm a tenured Associate Professor of Digital Media and the Program Director of Film &amp; Digital Media at <strong>The American University of Rome </strong>and a practicing award-winning multimedia artist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> I have over 15 years of experience teaching students all over the world using my tried and true custom approach (turning complex information into something simple, memorable, easy-to-understand in as short amount of time as possible) to ensure that <strong>you get the most important, relevant, and useful information that can be applied immediately to your art, work, and everyday life. </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p> New bonus lectures and resources will continue to be added and timely design advice will be provided in the discussion forum. I love to help and always respond to inquiries and discussions ASAP. <strong> </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Please Note: All students who enroll in this course also will receive periodic free and discounted access to my other top-rated current and upcoming courses.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p> You have a 30-day, 100% money-back guarantee with no questions asked so you have nothing to lose. I make myself available so you will have access to me if you have questions or need specific feedback along the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong></strong> Empower yourself now by enrolling in this Illustrator course and join our growing learning community!<strong> Click the \"Take This Course\" button in the upper right corner and let's get started building your illustration, software, and design skills today.</strong></p>",
