I have been working in animation for almost 8 years now, and have experience in both 2D and 3D animation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t I will take you through the very basic constructions and initial stages of drawing the cartoon figure, and break it down so that you can try these techniques to any character you want to draw yourself.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t I will then show you how to implement these basic techniques to draw characters based off reference and start designing your own creations.  </p>",
