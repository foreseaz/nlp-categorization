While we will focus on a specific project that has a gamer-feel, you can use what you&#039;ve learned and apply it to many other projects.  </p>  <p>  \tAfter having designed the GUI, you will then learn how to export the individual assets for use with After Effects. Then you will learn how to rebuild the design in After Effects, and then finally animate it; and that&#039;s when the fun really begins.  </p>  <p>  \tAfter watching this course, the possibilities are endless in terms of what you can create.  </p>  <p>  \tIn Photoshop, you will learn about layers, layer styles, layer clipping masks, layer blend modes, how to use textures to create metallic interfaces, and much much more.  </p>  <p>  \tIn After Effects, you will learn how to use the basic interface. You will be able to create your own animations by utilizing key frames, which allow you to control many aspects of a given object. With this skill, you will be able to create your own animations for any project imaginable.  </p>  <p>  \tSo let&#039;s get started!  </p>",
