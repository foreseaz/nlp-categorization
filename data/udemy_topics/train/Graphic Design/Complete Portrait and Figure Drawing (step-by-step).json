With the modified version of the &quot;Reilly&quot; technique used here, the subscriber/student will learn to draw a full figure or portrait in under 45 minutes from life or photographs on toned paper with less than six values using carbon pencils and white pastel chalk. To aid in learning this technique, two complete drawings (figure and portrait) are demonstrated with running description of the drawing process throughout.  </p>",
