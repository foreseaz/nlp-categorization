Gary will guide you through a &#039;live project scenario&#039; creating artwork for a fictional organisation, replicating many of the challenges faced on real world projects, sharing with you little known &#039;insider&#039; tips in a style and language that consistently achieves winning results.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t            You&#039;ll start with little more than a blank canvas and a series of supplied hand sketches, along with concepts for a new branding and marketing project. Working together from detailed expert video lectures you will build from start to finish artwork that will encompass logos, flyers, Facebook headers and stationery packed full of rich and arresting vector artwork. Learn how to make the most of a bewildering array of tools and features, to achieve the results you want, save valuable time and avoid costly mistakes.  </p>",
