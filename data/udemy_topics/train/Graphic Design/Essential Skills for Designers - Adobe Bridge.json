    "description": "<p>Adobe Bridge is the file management application within the Creative Cloud that connects all the other Adobe tools and serves as a hub for all of your creative projects. At its core it is similar to Finder on Mac or Explorer on PC but with the main difference that it was developed to work seamlessly with Adobe file formats and integrate closely with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Â In this course you are going to start from the very basics like how to find certain files, filter and preview images to more complex techniques like Batch Rename and Batch processing and so much more. You will also learn about all the features that integrates Bridge with Photoshop and all the other Adobe applications.</p>",
