    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tChances are, Marvel Studios won’t be knocking on your door next week to hire you to design logos in their next phase of movies, but that doesn’t mean you can’t master the same techniques they use to create strong, professional title-art for your own projects. If you’ve got an upcoming app that needs an eye-popping logo or even if you’re just designing a banner for your school’s next epic table-tennis tournament, then this course will teach you everything you need to know to start from nothing and end with a polished vector-based logo. Your finished piece could be used in countless digital media formats or exported at a higher resolution for print.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tSo “true believers”, who’s ready to tackle their first Marvel-style logo?!  </p>",
