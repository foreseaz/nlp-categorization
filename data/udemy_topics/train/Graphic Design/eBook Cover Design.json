    "description": "<p>  \t  eBook cover design, most often, tends to involve expensive and hard to learn software. Covers are one of the most important parts of the sales process. High definition covers directly drives sales.  </p>  <p>  \t  When it comes to your eBook cover, nothing is more important than a high resolution and visually engaging design.<strong></strong> If your cover looks like it was created by an amateur, book  sales will suffer not to mention your market credibility as an author.  </p>  <p>  \t  Most people, especially those who love reading eBooks, will base a large part of their purchasing decision on how appealing the cover is. Let&#039;s face it; most are visual creatures. When you browse through eBooks on Amazon, Google Books, Smashword or other eBook sales platforms, how many times have you purchased eBooks with poorly designed covers?  </p>  <p>  \t  We almost always gravitate towards high quality design so if you do this, your customers and readers do as well.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course, we teach students the basics of creating stunning eBook covers using only the Microsoft Powerpoint program so join us today!  </p>",
