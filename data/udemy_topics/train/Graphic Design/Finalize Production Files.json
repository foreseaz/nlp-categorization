You will learn the best ways to build your files, the fastest methods to craft your diecuts, and the easiest techniques to achieve perfect results.</p><p><strong>This is taken from real life work experience!</strong></p><p>I will show you how projects are done from zero to final production. We will get the visual assets from the client, and use them to build our products.</p><p><strong>So, what are we going to do?</strong></p><p>We will create a shelf stopper, a shelf wobbler, a shelf strip and a 50 x 50 cm free-standing unit that consists of a header, a base, two sides and three shelves.</p><p>We will prepare the print and cut files, as well as flat PDF preview files that we can send to our client for feedback or approval.</p><p>We will also learn how to prepare our files for offset printing, and how to add special effects like embossing, spot UV, foil stamping, etcâ€¦</p><p>Finally, we will package everything into a folder that will be sent for print and production.</p><p>This is a 47-minute video course from 2-Minute Design, so each video will be less than 3 minutes in length. This means that it is super easy to follow, just like any 2-Minute Design content.</p>",
