You&#039;ll also see how this technique can be used when preparing materials to be printed. <br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Resource files and links are included in the course, too.</p><p>This fun technique will help you see how type can be used creatively as a graphic element,  beyond just communicating the written word, and it will help you hone your Adobe InDesign skills.</p><p>Students who want to complete the exercises must have beginner InDesign skills. Fundamental techniques may be shown, but not explained.</p><p>Â©2015 Joseph Caserto. All rights reserved.
