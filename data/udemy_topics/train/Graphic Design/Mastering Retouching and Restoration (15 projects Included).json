It starts from teaching the basics of retouching then goes on to more complex types of work. I particularly enjoyed the teeth and lips retouching. Perhaps because I always wondered how it was done! Excellent course for the beginner or those who want to brush up their skills.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Great Course</strong> </p><p style=\"\">Thank you for this excellent course.
