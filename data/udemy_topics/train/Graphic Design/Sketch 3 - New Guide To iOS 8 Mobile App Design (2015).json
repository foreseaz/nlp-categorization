Sketch 3 has an high quality fast growing community of talented designers and as of now it is considered the best choice from top designers worldwide. While Photoshop and Illustrator are amazing tools, they was created for other purposes, and then used for UI and UX design. This makes them more complicated to learn and sometimes less effective (e.g. when exporting assets or when managing projects with lots of screens and assets). Whether you are completely new to app design or just want to switch from Adobe, Sketch 3 is probably the best app to learn at the moment. Check out bohemiancoding website for more info  </p>",
