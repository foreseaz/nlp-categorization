This course teaches you how you can use those tools to create, retouch, and design!  </p>  <p>  \tThis course doesn&#039;t follow a traditional structure. Instead, it&#039;s broken down into the categories that students are most interested in, and each video stands on its own. There&#039;s no need to watch them in order! Simply choose the video that contains what you want to learn, and enjoy!  </p>  <p>  \tWhile you&#039;ll likely be able to follow along using older versions of Photoshop, it&#039;s recommended that you&#039;re running the latest version of Photoshop CC, part of the Creative Cloud.  </p>",
