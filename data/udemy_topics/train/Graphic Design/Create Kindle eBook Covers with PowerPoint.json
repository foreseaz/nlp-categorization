    "description": "<p>  \t Create Kindle eBook Covers with PowerPoint takes the mystery away from designing and producing a virtual cover for a Kindle eBook. It is important to have a cover image, or \"catalogue cover\" as this is what prospective purchasers will see. To make your book stand out you need a graphical image that can be read when squished into a thumbnail size on the Kindle store, and this course will show you how using software you may already have.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t The course is split into sections covering setting up PowerPoint, adding and editing images, searching for royalty-free and stock images and putting it all together. There is a bonus walkthrough video at the end for consolidating all the material covered in the course.  </p>\n\n<p>  \tThe course comprises video lectures, PowerPoint template files and PDF documents and should take between 3 and 5 hours to complete.  </p>\n\n<p>  \tPowerPoint has been included with every version of Microsoft Office for years. I have chosen it because it will be familiar to most people and is very easy to learn. If you use Microsoft Windows you probably already have it installed on your computer. If not, you can pick up a copy very cheaply for Windows computers. </p><p>N.B.This course is unsuitable for the Mac OS as the interface is different.</p>",
