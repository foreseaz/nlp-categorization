With each added lecture, the price of the course will go up accordingly. </strong></p><p><strong>I encourage you to sign up now as you'll have lifetime access to current and future tutorials.</strong></p><p>First we navigate the podcast store to provide examples on what works and what doesn't in podcast show art design.</p><p>Once we have a good idea of what to create, we start a new file in Photoshop and mimic the design principles of the top shows. While mimicking we will learn the use of design elements like:</p><ul><li>Masking</li><li>Gradients</li><li>Color Pallets</li><li>Negative Space</li><li>The Less is More Principle</li><li>How to Design with the Platform in Mind</li><li>How to take drawings and turn them into digital art</li></ul><p>Finally, we'll create a personalized standout show art.</p><p>You can use it for your portfolio or your podcast.</p><p>This course is fast, fun and funny. I cut out the fat. If it's not going to make you laugh or learn, it's not here. That's why the course is so short.</p><p><strong>Join in, let's get started.</strong></p>",
