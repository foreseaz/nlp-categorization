    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this interesting, enlightening, and sometimes entertaining close-up look at the concepts, the author carefully and clearly defines and explains affordances. Five different types of affordances are distinguished and the author shows how practitioners should use them together in UX design.The types of affordance and principles of their use are illustrated with engaging examples.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      The course is entirely in the form of videos, as voice-over on PowerPoint slides. Lectures are interspersed with thought questions and exercises. The approximate running time of all the videos is about four hours, including the time to work out the questions and exercises.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Why take this course? Few topics in HCI or UX have been as misunderstood and misused as the notion of &ldquo;affordance&rdquo;. Yet few concepts are as central to effective UX design. The author of this course is a leading expert in the subject and this presentation is based on a seminal paper and a defining book chapter.  </p>",
