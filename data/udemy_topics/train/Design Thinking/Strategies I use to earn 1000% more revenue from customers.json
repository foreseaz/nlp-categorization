That would mean a 1200% increase in revenue from just that same customers. And if they remain a customer the following year that would be 2400% and even more if they remain a customer longer.</p><p>How good would it be if you could make 10x or 20x from each customers? That would put your business and your monthly income on a whole new level, right? Take whatever amount you are making today and multiply it by 10. Do you want that kind of an income? Of course you do.</p><p>This is why in this course I added a number of common methods to adjust your revenue model and the way you monetize to get people to become repeat customers. Of course, not all your customers will become repeat clients, but many of them will, and you will make much more money form them.</p><p>Go ahead, sign up for the course, and let's get you on a path to make much more money from each customer.</p>",
