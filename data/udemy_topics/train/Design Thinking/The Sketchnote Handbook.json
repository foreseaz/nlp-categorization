    "description": "<p style=\"\">This captivating video tells the story of sketchnotes--why and how you can use them to capture your thinking visually, remember key information more clearly, and share what you&#039;ve captured with others. Designer <strong style=\"\">Mike Rohde</strong>, who coined the term sketchnoting to describe his visual note-taking process, shows you how to incorporate sketchnoting techniques into your own note-taking process. Regardless of your drawing ability (or inability!) you&#039;ll learn how to draw as you listen to better process the information you&#039;re hearing and to actually have fun taking notes. Rohde addresses most people&#039;s fear of drawing by showing, step-by-step, how to quickly draw people, faces, type, and simple objects for effective and fast sketchnoting. By the end of this video, you&#039;ll be itching to attend a meeting just so you can draw about it.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Running Time: 1h 10m<br style=\"\"></p>  ",
