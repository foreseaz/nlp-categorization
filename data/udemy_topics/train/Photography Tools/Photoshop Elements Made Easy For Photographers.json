    "description": "<p>This course is for folks who are looking to take their photographs from drab to fab. I use plain english and not techy words to confuse the student. I explain each step with simple, time tested, easy to use concepts. I have been teaching this course almost ten years now in live venues and it has been a raging success. This course is laid out in a workflow fashion as we start with how to get all the photos on to the computer, then make them look great and finally how to make a print that anyone would be proud of. Also, If your having issues such as your prints are not matching your screen, we&#039;ll cover those as well. I include all of the practice photos that you can download and work through the lectures with me. There are many very sophisticated courses out there, but I teach this and structured the course so anyone can understand, and learn in a relaxed environment. </p>",
