I will explore and explain all of the menus and tell you what they are, when to use them, and why.  </p>  <p>  \t  I will also cover in depth:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>ISO</li>  \t<li>Aperture and Depth of Field</li>  \t<li>Shutter speed</li>  \t<li>Focus modes and points</li>  \t<li>Exposure modes</li>  \t<li>Metering modes</li>  \t<li>Flash</li>  \t<li>Lenses</li>  \t<li>And much more</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  This course is for anyone who owns the <strong style=\"\">Canon 6D</strong> body be it brand new or since it was first released.  </p>  <p>  \t  I have been shooting professionally with Canon cameras for over 7 years have several  Canon DSLR bodies that I shoot with regularly.  When I first get a new  camera I generally do some initial setup of the camera, check out some  of the new features and then start shooting with it.  Over time I will  return and explore the new features, functions, and capabilities  and often times will discover something I didn&#039;t know existed or forgot  was new with the body I am using.  </p>  <p>  \t  I recommend this course for anyone interested in getting the most out of their <strong style=\"\">Canon 6D</strong>.  </p>",
