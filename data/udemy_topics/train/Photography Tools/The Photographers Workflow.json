Designed exclusively for photographers, it provides easy and affordable access to both Photoshop CC and Lightroom 5. This video training program, presented by award-winning photographer and experienced instructor Mikkel Aaland, is for photographers who now have access to both of these powerful, industry-standard photography tools.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t     Specifically geared to photographers who have a solid grounding in Photoshop Lightroom, but who would now also like to take advantage of the powerful features in Photoshop, this course includes 2 hours of high-definition video tutorials, complete with lesson files, assessment quizzes, and a printed reference guide. In addition to describing the most common workflow tasks between Lightroom and Photoshop,  Mikkel will dive into the most common image-editing tasks in Photoshop CC such as photo retouching, creating panoramas, enhancing slideshows, and more.\r\n</p>",
