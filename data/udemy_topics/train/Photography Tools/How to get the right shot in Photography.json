    "description": "<p>  \t      You will learn how to shoot landscape and frame your photos. Learning how to take a nice picture of a tree through different angles when often proven difficult. We will study compositing as well. We will also take a look at panoramas and how to make a great black &amp; white panorama of New York. We will go over how to take a photo at night with no tripod (sometimes you are not alowed to put a tripod on the ground for your photo). We will learn how to retouch a daylight photo (no sunset or sunrise), I have been asked by several persons how to retouch a daylight photo as it can be more difficult. We will finish by retouching a dramatic black &amp; white photo with selective colors, not everybody likes selective color in black &amp; white but I think it can be very interesting. I will give you a few tips and tricks to make it easier for you to retouch your photos in different circumstances. I hope you have fun!  </p>",
