    "description": "<p>Photoshop might seem like a complex program but I am here to help you mastering the basics so that you will be able to let your images stand out above the rest. Ever see pics that POP?, well yours can as well by applying subtle changes through Layering, blending, cloning, colouring and so much more. Although this course is deigned for the beginner, modules will be added of more advanced practices that you won't find a need to take an advanced course. I will make myself available for any queries and applications that you would like to see, therefore I will produce a video relating to your query and send it to you personally. Thank you for considering \"Learning Photoshop from scratch\"!</p>",
