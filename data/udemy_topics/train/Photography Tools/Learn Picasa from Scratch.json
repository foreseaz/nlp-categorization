Photoshop is a great program, but if you're new to photo editing, Picasa is a great place to start.</p><p>You can download it for free for either your Mac or PC, installation is easy and we will guide you through that, and using it is pretty simple and straight forward.</p><p>You might be an experienced photographer and editor but you might want to consider Picasa if you have run out of Photoshop licenses for your \"other\" computers.</p><p>Create beautiful images with Picasa's special effects or just create good clean images when your images need minor adjustments.</p><p>We'll show you how to white balance your images and then step though cropping and other manipulation to get the best out of them.</p><p>We'll show you how to save them out, create slide shows and even prepare you to send them to a lab near you for printing. <br></p><p>Picasa, no wonder so many people are using it now!</p>",
