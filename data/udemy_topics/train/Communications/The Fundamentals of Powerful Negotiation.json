    "description": "<p>Negotiation is a big part of life - from buying a car or a house, taking a new job, or working out a serious conflict. Yet it&#039;s easy to believe we&#039;re usually at a disadvantage - that others are born negotiators, while we are not. Nothing could be further from the truth. Negotiation is a skill that just about everyone can learn to do well. </p><p>Presented by a master negotiator, these lessons teach you how to approach all phases of a negotiation and deal with a wide range of problems. Professor Freeman shows you how to negotiate effectively in both competitive and collaborative situations. You learn the art of handling sharp tactics, haggling, psychological traps, and other challenges, while always being &quot;hard on the problem and soft on the person&quot; - which is the key to achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. </p><p>Knowledge is power, and <strong style=\"\">The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal</strong> gives you a potent set of tools to serve your interests, resolve disagreements, and advance causes that you hold dear in respectful, principled ways. What could be more useful than that?</p>",
