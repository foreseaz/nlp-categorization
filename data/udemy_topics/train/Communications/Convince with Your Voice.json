When your audience can't see you (think webinars and phone calls) these aspects truly become game changing elements to consider for successful communication.</p>  <p>Did you know that 38% of “in-person communication comes from your tone of voice?  It goes up to 82% when your audience can’t see you (think webinars and phone calls).  You’ll actually <em>hear</em> how to use your volume, pace and inflections to get your audience to be completely engaged with a recipe to analyze and maximize your tone of voice.</p>  <p>In this program, you will learn how to analyze and maximize the tone of your voice and word selection by uncovering how the two inter-play for successful communications when you are not face to face. If you want to engage listeners even when they can't see you, this program is for you.</p>",
