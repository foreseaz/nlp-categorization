    "description": "<p>  \tListening is a crucial part of our ability to communicate and succeed. It affects how well we sell and persuade, build and maintain relationships, teach and manage, and appreciate and understand. Our business and personal lives are often determined by it.<br>  \t<br>  \t     However, listening is not a natural skill and unfortunately it is one that we are in danger of losing. The result of this is a restricted ability to communicate and engage.<br>  \t<br>  \t     I live to listen. As an international speaker and founder of The Sound Agency, I understand the impact of listening on communication, success and wellbeing. My TED talk on conscious listening is in the rare group that have achieved over 2.5 million views on TED&#039;s website alone.<br>  \t<br>  \t     So join me as I help you become a master of Conscious Listening and bring confidence and control to your communication.  </p>",
