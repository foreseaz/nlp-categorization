Each topic is clearly explained and demonstrated on the videos, and accompanied in the online Workbook with suggested exercises, practice tips, and checklists.  </p>  <p>  \t         The course is filled with practical information about conducting a sound check, voice warm-ups, and reminders that will help you avoid common public-speaking missteps.
