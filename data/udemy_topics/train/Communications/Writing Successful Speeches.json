Have you ever had to give a speech yourself and spent ages staring at a blank piece of paper, unsure where to start?  If so, here's some good news.  Writing Successful Speeches gives you a plan and tools to write speeches that will get results.</p><p>This course is really about effective communication, in this case, in the form of a speech.  Short videos, speech templates and written materials are provided to help the speech writer develop a persuasive and memorable speech for themselves or someone else.</p><p>Writing Successful Speeches takes the learner through the whole process of developing a successful speech in a series of modules: from setting goals with the speaker, identifying the wants-and-needs of the audience, structuring the speech, anticipating likely questions, a user-friendly format for the speech that helps the speaker - and much more besides.</p>",
