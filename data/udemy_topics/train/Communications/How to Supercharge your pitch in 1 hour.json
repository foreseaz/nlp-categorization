I had to do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=titsImALWe4\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">theatrical  monologues of 90 minutes</a> and 10 minute pitches on trains for the entire 3-and-a-half  hour journey (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giPcaT-pQxk\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">rotating between 11 wagons, talking to 6 people at a time</a>), as well as  summarizing my messages in 12 second clips for radio interviews, right through  to <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/user/IoReporterSkyTG24/1\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">21 minute live television transmissions on my own program</a> (with guests like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0razFkN6_uI\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Jeff  Bezos</a>).  Lastly, I had the chance to interview thousands of guests, ranging from  one-to-one interviews with well-known figures such as<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU5Ujb8fQ6o\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">  Steve Ballmer in front of 1,500 people</a>, to live interviews with<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYC6Fju7FbI\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> Al Gore</strong></a><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYC6Fju7FbI\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">  on TV including accepting live questions from the audience</a> (while defending  myself in the meantime from physical attack by a fanatic…).</p>    <p>Above  all, out of sheer necessity, I had to invent different and unconventional  methods of presenting, in order to be able to survive in situations that you  cannot overcome just by showing some simple slides. I brought <a href=\"http://youtu.be/KH-ZMv_0H-I?t=18m28s\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">ping-pong  tables on the stage to explain and play at the same time</a>, I gave out rings  to marry the Internet, I used sensors to transform the<a href=\"http://cdn.blogosfere.it/thecrew/images/marco-montemagno-locandina.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\"> audience into a single joystick</a>, I folded T-shirts  in 5 seconds, I gave out sheets of paper to make portraits and I brought tennis  balls to throw on the stage.</p>    <p>Join  me and supercharge your pitch before you know it :)&nbsp;</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
