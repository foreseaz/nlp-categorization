In this course, you or your staff will learn the vital concepts, best practices, and principles. You’ll also take away a proven, time-saving, and easy-to-follow system for preparing effective presentations with slides, and even without slides.  </p>  <p>  \t                This is <em>not</em> a technical course about slide software (although you’ll gain some great tips). It is, instead, a program designed to help you take the software you’re likely (at least a little) familiar with and harness it for its true purpose – to support you when you present.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>But more than that</strong>, it’s about making the process of creating a presentation that is well-structured, engaging, and has the power to make an impact, easier.  </p>  <p>  \t                It can be a breeze!  </p>  <p>  \t                Whether you are a:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Trainer teaching a class</li>  \t<li>Manager or leader motivating staff</li>  \t<li>Subject-matter-expert presenting at a conference break-out session</li>  \t<li>Consultant providing feedback and recommendations</li>  \t<li>Business representative persuading clients</li>  \t<li>Student delivering a report to the class</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t                …doing an outstanding job with your presentation has unlimited value!  </p>  <p>  \t                This course will provide you with the power!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Here is just some of what you’ll get:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>4.5+ hours of information packed videos</li>  \t<li>21 common mistakes to avoid</li>  \t<li>The # 1 reason for the wrong types of slides, and how to avoid it</li>  \t<li>14 key considerations that will help you finally “get it”</li>  \t<li>7 principles that will make slide design intuitive</li>  \t<li>Basic design principles that can easily improve your slides</li>  \t<li>11 essential slide styles to make things easy</li>  \t<li><strong>The Breezentations™ System!</strong> Simple, step-by-step processes for easily:<br>  \t<ul>  \t\t<li>Creating powerful content</li>  \t\t<li>Designing powerful slides</li>  \t\t<li>Practicing for a powerful delivery</li>  \t</ul>  \t</li>  \t<li>Lifetime access to the entire program</li>  \t<li>A workbook, templates, checklists and other valuable job-aids</li>  \t<li>Access to me, personally.
