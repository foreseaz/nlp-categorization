    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Learning how to network is one of the most powerful tools to advance your professional and personal life.  The more relationships you have for your business the more opportunities, support, clients and most importantly, income you will create.  There are many strategies that you can use to obtain new clients; however, attending local networking groups is the quickest way to get clients now.  If you needed clients yesterday, then I will prepare you to prepare and work that group.  When I began my niche business, I turned to local networking, studied books on networking and worked with a consultant to strategize and as a result I increased my income by $35,000 in 6 months.  No, its not millions but it was a great start for my niche computer training business for senior citizens and allowed me to pay my bills, reinvest in my business and most importantly, sleep well at night.  At the end of the year, I had a goal of teaching 1,000 clients and with a networking strategy, I met that goal.  This course is for you, if you are NEW to networking or you have been networking for some time and are not getting the results you expected.  I share my insight in this course so you can regroup and strategize to get in the game and increase your client base.  </p>",
