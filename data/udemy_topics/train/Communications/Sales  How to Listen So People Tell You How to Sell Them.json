Here's what the world's best sales people, top negotiators, and best closers know that most people don't: listening skills are your secret weapon.</p><p>That's right.<em> </em>And that means two things for you. <em>First, you don't have to develop charisma. </em>You don't have to be slick, or eloquent, or smooth. In fact, today's buyer's are more skeptical of that veneer than ever. <em>And second, if you're talking to sell, you're leaving money on the table.</em></p><p>Here's why: People don't buy for your reasons no matter how prettily you dress them up. They buy for their reasons. And they will gladly tell you what those reasons are. </p><p>But only... If you know how to ask, and you know how to watch and listen for the answers. Sadly, most people don't.</p><p><strong>This course gives you a small, very specialized, set of techniques that few people have</strong> â€“ a questioning strategy that is simple, laser targeted, and disarming; and a powerful model of human behavior that will reveal people's deepest motivations almost instantly.</p><p><strong>This course is for you if you are:</strong></p><ul><li>Looking for a better job or more ore better gigs.</li><li>Trying to close more sales, more quickly and easily, with less stress.</li><li>Trying to land investors for your start up and really want to make a connection.</li><li>Buying a house or car or other big assets and want to land a better deal.</li><li>Negotiating a deal and want to have more power at the negotiating table.</li></ul><p><strong>What sets this course apart?</strong></p><p>This is not just a course of ideas. You will know how to use the techniques. And you'll have practice. We'll not only learn new structures and new techniques, we'll apply them together in real life situations - a high stakes negotiation, a high value sale, trading up from a position of weakness, and leading a set of people who are reluctant and skeptical.  </p><p>What people are saying about Tim Dawes</p><p><strong>What people are saying about Tim Dawes</strong></p><p><em>I used Tim as a career and personal coach a number times over my years at Microsoft.
