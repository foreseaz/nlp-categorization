With my help, in under five minutes he went from having no clue about how to order his report to imposing a clear, coherent, logical structure on his ideas.</p>\n\n<p>I've since gone on to share this technique with other report writers and trust me they're always blown away by its power and simplicity.

And I'm going to be showing you how to leave out the parts of a report all, yes ALL, readers skip. The pointless parts every report writer thinks are helping readers, but are really hindering them.</p>\n\n<p>And I'll be busting some myths about that all important executive summary. It's the only part of your report you can guarantee everyone will read, so you'll want to make sure it's as powerfully persuasive as it can be. I'll show you how.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stand out from the crowd with a report that looks as good as it reads</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'll be showing you how to take your almost-finished report up a notch with simple design and layout tips from a seasoned design professional. You'll even discover one little design trick that's been scientifically - yes, scientifically - proven to boost your credibility and persuasiveness with readers.</p>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for?
