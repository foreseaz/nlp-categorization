    "description": "<p>  \t        Did you know that HALF of all workers did not negotiate their last salary?  </p>  <p>  \t        Here&#039;s why: The thought of negotiation makes them nervous, they don&#039;t know how to find their worth, they&#039;re afraid of losing the offer, and they simply don&#039;t know what to say. Unfortunately, they&#039;re leaving thousands, even millions on the table.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>How would <em>you</em> like to have an extra $5,000?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        I surveyed former students and the average raise was more than $5,000. 1 in 5 increased their salary by $10,000 or more! Money that could be used for a vacation, a new home, or to pay off student loans or credit cards.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Accurately research your maximum worth on the market</li>  \t<li>Navigate the early stages of an interview, avoiding online forms and low-ball screening questions from HR</li>  \t<li>Use a 5-minute body language trick to increase your rate of success</li>  \t<li>Implement the same negotiation techniques used by the FBI</li>  \t<li>Confidently say exactly the right phrases to secure the highest salary and get paid what you deserve</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>What truly sets apart this course are the added modules you won&#039;t find anywhere else.</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>An interactive, role-playing &#039;hot seat&#039; to practice your negotiation</li>  \t<li>Detailed case studies and interviews, including a $63,000 increase</li>  \t<li>Advice on negotiating benefits, such as bonuses, flextime, relocation, and 8 more, as well as resources for women, non-profits, and startups </li>  </ul>  <p>  \t        If you&#039;re a professional interviewing for a <strong>new job</strong> and want to be part of the group that DOES negotiate, earn more money, and learn the salary negotiation secrets no one ever taught you, sign up today.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Also see:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>How To Negotiate a Job Offer (Student Edition)</li>  \t<li>How to Negotiate a Raise or Promotion</li>  </ul>",
