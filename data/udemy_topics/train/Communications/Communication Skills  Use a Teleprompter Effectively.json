Wouldn't it be nice to know that you can deliver a speech or newscast using a Teleprompter, and that you will look and sound natural, like you aren't really reading?</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn this How to Use a Teleprompter course, you will learn the following:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t*How to avoid the common blunders that make most people look and sound horrible when they are using a Teleprompter  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t*How to rehearse with the Teleprompter using video  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t*How to look natural  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t*How to sound conversational  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course is delivered primarily through spoken lecture. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course contain numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years.

Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards. Please enroll today.  </p>",
