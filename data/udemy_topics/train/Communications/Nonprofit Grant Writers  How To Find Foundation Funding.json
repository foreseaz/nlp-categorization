    "description": "<p>Foundations are a major source of funding for nonprofit organizations.  But you have to be able to find appropriate foundations that are interested in what you have to offer before you can receive any of the billions of dollars they hand out each year.  This course prepares you to understand what foundations are and how to find ones that you can successfully apply to for money to assist your nonprofit.  Grant writing can only happen after you find an appropriate target for your proposal--this course demonstrates tried and true strategies (using written documents and videos) in a step-by-step manner so you locate foundations to apply to.</p><p>The course will take about 1 hour to go through, although to fully implement the techniques will take more time.  The information will be useful over and over again as you search for different ideas and programs to fund.</p>",
