In exploring these issues, the presenters provide a brief introduction to the topic, a basic examination of important themes of culture and communication, two frameworks for viewing culture and examples from the presenters&#039; research and life experience. We hope this project serves as a catalyst for thought and discussion regarding the challenges and opportunities associated with living in a diverse world.  </p>",
