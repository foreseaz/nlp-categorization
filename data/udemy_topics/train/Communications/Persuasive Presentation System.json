    "description": "<p>Having great ideas is not enough to influence and change the world from the way it is. Great ideas only exist in your own minds. To influence and make changes, I like to think that we need to create bridges between our brains to our audiences&#039; brains. The connecting bridge is persuasive presentation.</p><p>Over the years, I extensively read and research on the different techniques regarding persuasive presentations. Through trial and error, I experimented different techniques and came up with a set of the best techniques to use that worked beautifully for me. I came up with a step-by-step system that ANYONE can use to greatly enhance their persuasive presentation skills: The Presentation Sensational System. You can think of the Presentation Sensational System as a one-stop shortcut that brings you instant results once you have mastered it. It&#039;s easy to follow as it guides you step-by-step along the way.</p><p>When you are done with this course, you will have the skills to create, on your own, and give a persuasive presentation that stands out from the rest and leaves a long lasting impression for your audience. </p>",
