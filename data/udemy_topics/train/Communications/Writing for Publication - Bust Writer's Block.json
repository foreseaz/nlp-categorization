    "description": "<p>\r\n\t    Make Writer&#039;s Block a distant memory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Writing for Publication is designed for both new and experienced writers who want to learn how to get their Creative Muse to help them quickly and easily write and sell magazine articles. This course evolved from my own struggles learning how to write articles for magazines.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t                         The course includes audio/video presentations, hands-on writing, and downloadable handouts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t              The lectures and videos guide you through the article writing and development process from start to finish. As a result, by the time you complete this course, you will have written an article that is ready to submit to a magazine editor for publication.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t        This course is designed to be self paced. It is best to complete the lectures in sequence because each lecture builds upon the previous lecture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    The course also includes editing and proofreading guidelines that will help you polish the articles you write and impress the magazine editors you work for.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t                  You will receive a Certificate of Completion upon completion of this course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t         Let&#039;s get started.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t         I&#039;ll meet you inside!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t         Carol\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Here&#039;s what some of my former students have said about this course:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>&quot;After taking Writing for Publication,</em><br>\r\n\t <em> I went from no sales to regular sales.&quot;</em><br>\r\n\t        —Andrea C., Sacramento, CA\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>&quot;Who knew writing could be so easy? </em><br>\r\n\t <em> This is one course that teaches skills </em><br>\r\n\t <em> you&#039;ll use again and again.&quot;</em><br>\r\n\t        —Sunny W., Monterey, CA\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>&quot;Carol cuts through all the hype and</em><br>\r\n\t <em> clearly explains how to get the creative</em><br>\r\n\t <em> muse to write.&quot;</em><br>\r\n\t        —Jake M., Orange County\r\n</p>",
