    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  If you&#039;re currently using paper, board games or live actors for your crisis simulations, why not build your own interactive crisis simulation that runs on email, mobile phones, social media and video? You don&#039;t need any programming skills, just a little familiarity with Conducttr.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis short course explains how to use Conducttr to create a crisis simulation. It starts with the basics and each lesson adds another layer of complexity but it all stays very easy to achieve.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t   The knowledge presented and the example project structure is applicable to other simulations and interactive narratives so your training is transferable to other examples.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t   The whole course is about 30 mins long but after the first two videos - about 10mins - you&#039;ll know enough to create something very workable for one team. As you proceed through the lessons you&#039;ll get to see how to create something scalable to run for 1000s of people.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t   It is advisable to complete the &quot;Introduction to Conducttr&quot; course first but its not mandatory.  </p>",
