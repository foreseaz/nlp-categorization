However, there is almost nil education on  software testing to students in their curriculum at colleges and institutes.  Also, for people already in the testing job, they have had very little formal  software testing training. Hence, those who train and prepare themselves in  software testing will be better positioned to grab these jobs and grow their  careers in this field. This Software Testing Course will  formally train you in software testing.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
