We recommend working your way through an entire section once you've started it. Simply stick to your individual speed of learning and keep practicing!  </p>  <p>  \t                              This course requires an installation of Tricentis Tosca Testsuite if you would like to do the exercises as well. Please feel free to watch the videos even without the software.  </p>  <p>  \t                     If you do not yet have a Tosca installation,  please visit the<strong> Tricentis </strong>homepage and request a <strong>free trial</strong> license. You will then be provided with the installation files and licenses required.  </p>",
