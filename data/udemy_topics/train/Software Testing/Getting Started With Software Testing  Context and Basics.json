    "description": "<p></p><p><p>Think about some of  worst failures like Titanic and Challenger. Think about software glitches that  caused failures of Ariane 5, banking, air traffic, missiles etc. It is  important to understand why it happened and how such things can impact us and  cause havoc and immense loss and damage. How it can be prevented by us in  future to achieve successful endeavors. Given this, build the context for us  for further learning and innovation. As software is getting in each every walk  of our life and all human endeavors, it becomes so critical that they do not  fail and perform well. This course will help build the context for further learning  in software testing. Based on this context and software testing basics, you can get started  with another next course, &quot;Software Testing Course&quot;, from me at  Udemy. </p>    <p>This course is for  around one and half hours and has 7 video lectures on software testing  basics.  You can complete this course in one go or take one lecture per day and can  complete learning the software testing basics within a week. If you have any queries  while you are covering different lectures, then, do feel free to write them to  me through the &#039;questions&#039; section and I will periodically answer back. Get started with the  software testing basics today.</p>&lt;/p&gt;<p></p>  ",
