Our world has become much smaller with the help of modern technologies. The revolution of smartphones and tablets brought us a new era of communication and computing. Nowadays, our everyday computing is not limited into the larger screens and we cannot imagine a single day without the pocket-sized devices. It has brought a lot more challenges to the service providers. In today’s world, service providers need to worry about making their websites applications compatible for pocket-sized devices. It is must required to survive in today’s market competition. This is where mobile testing comes into play and it has become a crucial part of our software testing. Nowadays, our applications need to be compatible for different screen sizes and operating systems. Mobile automation is still a brand new technology in the market and it’s difficult to find mobile automation expertise. As a result, we often find it very difficult to find proper resources to learn mobile testing.
