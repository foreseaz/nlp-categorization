The course will explain and identify the elements involved with a starting idea, lyrical and (or) musical, and  how to expand that idea (or seed as I like to call it) into a song.  The process is a creative journey full of twists and turns.  That is what makes songwriting so interesting and magical.  The marriage of music and lyrics.  </p>",
