I would gladly give more stars if available.\"</strong> - Adam Robson</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"WOW! The instructor's method and exercises meant I was nailing five octaves of note reading in just a day! ... Excellent production quality, excellent graphics, clear explanation. ... I'd give it ten stars if I could.\"</strong> - Mark S A Smith\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"After the course, I can assure you that you will not be seeing a music sheet the same way again.\"</strong> - Kathleen Rosario</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"I really can't say enough good things about this class.\"</strong> - Jim Thomason\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Since I launched my \"Read Music FAST!\" course 2 years ago people have been asking for a sequel, and I've finally had time to make one. In Part 1 I showed you how to read individual notes really fast using my unique reference note system. In this course I show you how to read notes in context, by getting really good at reading the distance <em>between</em> notes, and how to read and memorise the key signatures, all using lots of worked examples. I also reveal my Red/Blue System for working out major scales which I've been teaching my private students for years but have never published publicly before.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Note:</strong> this course does <em>not</em> teach you who to read rhythm. That's a huge subject that will require an entire course to itself!</p>",
