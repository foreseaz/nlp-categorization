    "description": "<p>This course takes you <em>Step-by-Step</em> through the process to prepare your subconscious to freely, easily and creatively play piano in all keys.  The path to success is <em>mastering each step</em>, one at a time.  Once this happens, the subconscious does the <em>\"work\"</em> and you have the <strong>FUN</strong>.</p><p>The course covers the Pachelbel Canon bass line, open voicings, melodic creation and creating a groove, using modes.  This is a great \"starter\" to learn to improvise on the piano.</p><p>Here are the steps in Pachelbel Canon Improv:</p><p><b>Step-by-Step by Martan Mann</b></p><p><b> </b><b>Step #1</b><b>: Pachelbel Bass Line.</b></p><p>The Bass Line of the Pachelbel Canon:</p><p>I V VIm IIIm IV I IV V</p><p><b>Step #2</b><b>: Pachelbel Bass Line w/Melody.</b></p><p>This is adding the melody of the Pachelbel Canon to the Bass Line above. The melody starts on the third and moves down the major scale.</p><p><b>Step #3</b><b>: Pachelbel Bass Line with Continuous Melody.</b></p><p>Practice the Continuous Melody Exercise in Quarter Notes, Quarter-Note Triplets, Eighth Notes and Eighth-Note Triplets.</p><p><b>Step #4:</b><b> </b><b>Bass Line w/Random Continuous Melody.</b></p><p>Now we combine the above exercise into random rhythmic notes.</p><p><b> </b><b>Step #5:</b><b> </b><b>Introduction to Open Voicings.</b></p><p>Here is a beginning introduction to Open Voicings . . . also know as Four-Part Harmony.</p><p><b>Step #6:</b><b> </b><b>Open Voicing Bouncing Exercise.</b></p><p>Study how to randomly bounce through the Open Voicings (without doubling the third).</p><p><b>Step #7:</b><b> </b><b>Open Voicings with Melody.</b></p><p>Here we learn how to combine the Open Voicings with Melody.</p><p><b>Step #8:</b><b> </b><b>Open Voicings with Melody in all Voices.</b></p><ul><li>Now we progress . . . placing melodic ideas in the Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass parts. You can play in thirds, sixths and tenths.</li><li>Here is where we have the most fun. First learn how to clap or sing a groove. Then apply the groove to the Pachelbel Canon.
