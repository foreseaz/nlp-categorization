There are certain rules they follow.  Once you understand the rules you can choose to use or break them.</p>\n\n<p>We'll use real life example to demonstrate how the 6 most used chords in popular music work and work together.</p>\n\n<p>Every lecture builds on the next lecture and is easy to follow.  By the end you should be able to take a song concept, and start building chord progressions that make sense.</p>\n\n<p>I you love songwriting and you want to start writing songs outside of your comfort zone, this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to see you on the inside!</p>\n\n<p>-R</p>",
