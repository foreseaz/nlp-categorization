Intuitive Visual Recognition</p><p>2. Visual Memory in the Brain</p><p>3. Say it out Loud to store in Brain</p><p>4. Practice Smart - Exercises</p><p>************************************************</p><p><strong>Learn to think in GROUPS &amp; PATTERNS </strong>with some extra Music Hot Tips from me.  Music Students are frustrated when they want to learn to read music because they are \"Not Focused\".  It is not their fault.  They do not know \"how\" and \"where\" to focus!  In this program, I help you to think in Groups and in Patterns so that you can learn easily!  When you have fun in your learning, you find that everything is easy, not because music has changed, but it is because the 'approach' of learning has changed as you enroll into this 7 Day program.</p><p><strong>This 7 Day Program</strong> is designed for you to mast this skill of learning ALL 22 Music Notes in 7 Days.  Only learn what you need to learn for that \"one day\" so that your brain can absorb the information and retain it in your memory bank.  Then the next day, you learn 2 or 5 more music notes.  Do not try to gulp at all 22 notes on one day unless you are an advanced student.  This program is for 'beginners' who want to master 'music note reading' quickly!  </p><p>This course can also be used by<strong> Music Teachers or Parents </strong>who want to teach their children to 'Read Music Fast'. You can use these videos to guide your children in this Music Note Attack Method. Children learn very quickly in this 7 Day Program. For younger children, you may want to stretch it to 7 WEEKS instead of 7 Days.  Even 7 weeks is a very good accomplishment!  :) Have fun!</p><p><strong>Day 1:</strong>  Three Music Notes in <strong>Treble Clef:</strong>  <strong>E,  B, F</strong></p><p>            Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 3 Treble Clef Notes: E, B, F</p><p>Day 1 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 2:</strong> Two Music Notes in <strong>Treble Clef:</strong>  <strong>G, D</strong></p><p>            Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 5 Treble Clef Notes: C, E, G, B, D, F</p><p>Day 2 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 3:</strong>  Five Music Notes in <strong>Treble Clef:</strong> <strong>D,</strong> <strong>F, A, C, E</strong></p><p>            Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 4 Treble Clef Notes: D,  F, A, C, E</p><p>Day 3 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 4:</strong>  Three Music Notes in <strong>Bass Clef:  G, D, A</strong></p><p>             Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 3 Bass Clef: G, D, A</p><p>Day 4 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 5:</strong>  Two Music Notes in <strong>Bass Clef: F, B</strong></p><p>             Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 5 Bass Clef Notes: G, B, D, F, A</p><p>Day 5 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 6: </strong> Five Music Notes in<strong> Bass Clef:  A, C, E, G, B</strong></p><p>Smart Practice &amp; Exercises in 5 Bass Clef Notes: A, C, E, G, B</p><p>Day 6 Test!</p><p><strong>Day 7:</strong>   Exam Time on the 22 Music Notes!</p><p>Exam 1:  Treble Clef Whole Notes:  C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F</p><p>Exam 2:  Treble Clef Half Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F</p><p>Exam 3:  Treble Clef Quarter Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F</p><p>Exam 4:  Treble Clef Mixture of Notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F</p><p>Exam 5:  Bass Clef Whole Notes:   G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</p><p>Exam 6: Bass Clef Half Notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</p><p>Exam 7: Bass Clef Quarter Notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</p><p>Exam 8: Bass Clef Mixture of Notes: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C</p><p><strong>BONUS Section:  Fun &amp; Games!</strong></p><p>**************************************</p><p><strong>This Level 2 is part of a  \"Read Music Fast\" Series.</strong></p><p><strong>1.
