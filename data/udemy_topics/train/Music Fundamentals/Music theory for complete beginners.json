No matter what kind of instrument or musical endeavor you're interested, the most fundamental concepts are always the basics of sound in time, the rhythm. </p><p>We take an approach to study the basics of music in a way everyone can learn with no past musical experience whatsoever.</p><p>It is directed toward people with no means to find a good teacher, or who wants to learn by himself. </p><p>We include tutorials, exercises, and dictations as our main way to understand and practice the concepts. </p><p>Our approach is 100% practical, you should be making some rhythms from the very beginning, and have some solid skills by the end of the course. </p><p>Is very important to take a course like this before trying to learn any instrument, or try to compose, because, you need a solid foundation that sometimes teachers don't have the time to share. </p>",
