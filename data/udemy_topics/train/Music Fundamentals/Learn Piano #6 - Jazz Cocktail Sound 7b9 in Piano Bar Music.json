Did you know that it is not difficult at all to create those sounds?  If you are following this Reharmonization series, make sure you grasp the concept of Dominant Chords &amp; Secondary Dominant Chords in Level 5.</p>    <p>  \t<strong>Here's the Secret:  </strong>To get into cool jazzy style of playing, you need to focus on the dominant chords and secondary dominant chords.  Learn to just alter one tone, and that tone will create that cocktail sound that you want to hear in your music.  Cocktail style of music functions and moves in the Circle movement of 6-2-5-1. The <strong>TRICK </strong>is to alter a tone in some of these dominant chords.  </p>  <p>  \t      In this course, you are going to learn Music Tips to alter a tone in the dominant chords to create the cocktail sound in piano bar music.  This is just the 'beginning' of learning basic music fundamentals to create cocktail sounds.  Learn Piano Level 6 is part of a series of a 10 Level course.  So if you are a beginner, you will need Learn Piano Level 1 to Level 5 to give you that foundation to do chord substitution to secondary dominants. This is the 6th level of reharmonizing \"Away in a Manger\" to Level 6.  Keyboard diagrams and charts will not include the earlier levels.</p>  <p>  \t      As a bonus, I am going to show you a few RUNS from simple to advanced to help you reach the cocktail runs so that you can put them freely into your music.  This section is entirely a BONUS, a gift to you, as this section itself is already a course on its own.  </p><p>*****************************************************************</p>  <p><strong>About Rosa's Piano Online Course:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Over 6000 very happy students already in my Udemy classes</em></li><li><em><em><em>See the </em><em>5 Star Reviews from VERY satisfied students</em></em></em></li><li><em>You get free lifetime access</em></li><li><em>All videos are at your finger tips to watch anytime &amp; anywhere</em></li><li><em>All future extra lectures and upgrades are always free</em></li><li><em>Unconditional Udemy 30 day money-back guarantee and that's my personal promise to your success!</em></li><li><em>Join this happy family of students &amp; enroll into this course</em></li></ul>  <p>  \t      ____________________  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The following 16 Topics are covered:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  1.
