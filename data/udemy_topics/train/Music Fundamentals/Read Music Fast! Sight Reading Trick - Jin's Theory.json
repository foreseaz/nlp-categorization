They are all proved to work on my students. If you have any trouble in sight reading, this course is the correct one for you!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why take this course?</strong></p><p>If you pick up a music piece very slow because of sight reading; if you are still reading notes one by one; if you take more than 10s to read 4 bars; if you cannot handle to read both treble and bass clefs together, come to join this course!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong><strong></strong><br></p><p>This course starts with the introduction to several musical terms in 5 lessons. If you know these terms very well, you can skip this part. After that, reading techniques for treble clef and bass clef are taught separately. Hints from myself will be introduced as well. Finally, it is my silver and golden practice method.</p><p><br></p>",
