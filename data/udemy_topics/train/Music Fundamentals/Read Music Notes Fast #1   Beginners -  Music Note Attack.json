An in-depth look into Reading 22 Music Notes Quickly from Treble Clef &amp; Bass Clef. <strong> 56 Lectures with 2 Hour Content.</strong></p><p>I receive so many requests from students that I finally need to write out this <strong>unique method</strong> - step by step - exercises by exercises - so that <strong>all BEGINNERS</strong> will gain confidence to read notes quickly and overcome the fear of reading music notes.</p><p>This course can also be used by <strong>Music Teachers or Parents who want to teach their children to 'Read Music Fast'. </strong> You can use these videos to guide your children in this Music Note Attack Method.  Children learn much faster in this way as they learn to visualize these notes in their brain.  In fact, they learn much faster than adults because they follow instructions, whereas adults are not as good as following through instructions.</p><p>******************************************</p><p><strong>Reading Music:  Traditional Way vs Non-Traditional Way</strong></p><p><strong>It is FUN to learn to read music.</strong>  There are some <strong>basic music fundamentals </strong>that you need to learn in order to be able to start reading music.  You need to understand the music staff, the grand staff, the lines, the spaces, the alphabets, the letter names, treble clef, bass clef &amp; middle C.  I will use very focused videos to show you how to understand the basics so that you have a clear foundation to work on as you proceed to learn to read music notes.</p><p>Many people think that it is difficult to read music but it is <strong>NOT.</strong></p><p>I show you the <strong>Traditional Method</strong> of how students are taught to read music. The Traditional method WORKS but it is <strong>slow going. </strong> It is good for you to know the Traditional Method.  We don't want to throw away what works.  We want to improve on 'what works' to make it 'more fun' for beginners to overcome the frustrations of reading music!  This is how my <strong>\"Note Attack &amp; Say It\" Method</strong> got developed as I saw the joy of seeing students gaining confidence in these drills and exercises of moving from <strong>Level 1 </strong>(The Note Attack Method) to <strong>Level 2 </strong>(Application of the Note Attack Method) &amp; then onto <strong>Level 3</strong> (Drilling Exercises with Speed).</p><p>**************************************************</p><p><strong>In this course, you will have 1 to 2 minute videos</strong> to arouse your interest to learn to read music quickly with this non-traditional method. </p><p>No draggy long videos but each video is to to the point!</p><p><strong>Each video has a specific topic.</strong></p><p><strong>Each topic is focused</strong> so that you can refer to the videos quickly for reference.</p><p>The whole idea of the course is to help you build a <strong>GOOD foundation</strong> to musical terms so that you can quickly go and read music using my <strong>Music Note Attack Method</strong> to gain confidence right away.</p><p>*****************************************************</p><p><strong>Rosa's Music Note Attack Method:</strong></p><p>1. Intuitive Visual Recognition</p><p>2. Visual Memory in the Brain</p><p>3. Say it out Loud to store in Brain</p><p>4. Practice Smart - Exercises</p><p><strong>Music is actually the simplest written language for anyone to learn. You only need to know 7 alphabet letters: A B C D E F G.</strong> Once you learn the basics, and know how to make use of what the traditional method teaches, you can then use my Unique method to tap into the power of reading music notes quickly with confidence. This will help you overcome all the years of fear and frustrations in reading music, and the reward you receive is for a life time.</p><p>You will soon discover reading music is a<strong> lot of fun </strong>when you use my <strong>Music Note Attack </strong>Method!
