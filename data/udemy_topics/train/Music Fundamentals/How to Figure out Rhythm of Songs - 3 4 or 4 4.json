Is it in 3/4 or 4/4 Time?</strong><br><br></p><p><strong>We all love to listen to music. </strong> When we listen to a song, we tune into the rhythm more than anything else. Most people don’t catch or don’t care about the occasional bad note or chord. But if the rhythm goes off in a performance, it’s the first thing the audience will notice.<br></p><p><strong>Rhythm is an essential element in all music.</strong> You can mix together any sounds you want, but if there is no underlying rhythm to the sounds, there is no music. </p><p>Welcome to this course on \"How to Figure out the rhythm of a song?  I’m so happy you’re here.  You might be wondering, <em>is this the right course for me?</em></p><p>I designed this course for anyone who wants to play by ear and they want to figure out whether the song is written in 3/4 time or 4/4 time.  </p><p>When you play your song, whether on a piano, guitar, or ukulele, you want to make sure you play your songs in the Right rhythm.<br></p><p>Songs have different time signature. Most songs are written with these 2 time signature.  3/4 or 4/4 Time.</p><ul><li>When it is 3/4 song, you count the beat 1 2 3.</li><li>When it is 4/4 song, you count the beat 1 2 3 4</li></ul><p>It seems very obvious, isn't it?</p><p>But you will be so surprised that when it comes to music, most people do not know how to count.  This is why I created this course for you The frustration many people face is that they can't tell whether the songs they play are written in 3/4 time or 4/4 time.</p><p>Let me tell you, it takes time to learn Rhythm.
