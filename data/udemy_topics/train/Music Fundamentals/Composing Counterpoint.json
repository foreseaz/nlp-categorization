    "description": "<p id=\"yass_top_edge_dummy\">  </p>  <p id=\"yass_top_edge\">  </p>  <p>  \t    There is one thing all great classical composers and jazz/pop arrangers have in common: they have a good working knowledge of counterpoint. In this course, you will learn everything you need to write proper, academic counterpoint. In addition, you&#039;ll learn some cool contrapuntal tricks like inversion and imitation.  </p>  <p>  \t    This course is suitable for both complete beginners to composition and advanced musicians/composers who find they are lacking in counterpoint knowledge. The only prerequisite is that you should be able to read music notation. This course is particularly useful for pop/jazz musicians. In these genres, people with proper contrapuntal skills can be hard to come by, so by learning these skills you can put yourself apart from the crowd.  </p>  <p>  \t    For almost every lecture, there will be one or more exercises. These exercises can be sent to the instructor in order to have them checked personally. (!) This is a rare feature for online courses. If you are currently following composition in university, this course can be a great help since it provides a clear overview of the topic and you can get your homework checked by the instructor before you hand it in.  </p>  <p id=\"yass_bottom_edge\">  </p>",
