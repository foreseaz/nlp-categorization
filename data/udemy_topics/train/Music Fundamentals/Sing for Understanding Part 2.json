For every song, each musical concept is introduced in a sequential format. There will be new rhythmic patterns, solfa and interval formations. Learners will be able to transfer their understanding of these concepts to  playing their instruments (specifically the piano). This course will introduces exercises to develop the learner's two part hearing and thinking. As well as listening skills, this course also introduces read and writing simple notation and from the stave in solfa. This course does not use letter names.</p>\n\n<p>This course would be suitable for those who has limited musical experience and those who wants to develop their musicianship through singing. It is also suitable for those who wants to improve their sight reading and singing skills.</p>",
