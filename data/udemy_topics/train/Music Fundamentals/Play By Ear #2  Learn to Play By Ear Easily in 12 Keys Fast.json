People need to learn to read music.  </p>  <p>  \t               The <strong>MAGIC </strong>of this course is that you do not need 12 different score sheet, and you do not need to read music to play in all 12 Keys.  </p>  <p>  \t               All you need is one sheet written in the 7-tone numbers and you will be able to play a song in different keys.  </p>  <p>  \t            You will learn <strong>17 Magic Tips</strong> along the way to play in all 12 Keys.  </p>  <p>  \t          There is a total of <strong>59 Practices to 19 Songs.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Here's the Secret: The 7 tone music </strong>is a breakthrough and short cut to sight reading music.  It is time-saving for performers to produce music from paper to sound without worrying about key signature.  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>This number notation      is key      independent; therefore there is no need to rewrite the music for      different keys.</li>  \t<li>The notation is an      easy way for composers to record and communicate their ideas quickly.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>The MAGIC of this POWERFUL 7-Tone Music:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>The 7-tone music is intuitive      and effective in      communicating music.</li>  \t<li>It is a music      notation that is consistent, uniform and succinct.</li>  \t<li>You can learn the      system in one hour. That´s how simple and easy it is.</li>  \t<li>It allows you to      intuitively SEE patterns and many elements of music at a glance.</li>  \t<li>Its simplicity promotes      efficient learning particularly      in playing songs by ear.</li>  \t<li>The 7-tone music allows you      to play a given song in all 12 keys </li>  \t<li>You need to become familiar with the 12 scales.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>   In this Play By Ear Method 2 series, </strong> I provide you with many tips and analysis to show you how to take full advantage of this 7-tone music you learned in \"Play by Ear Method 1 - Pick out Melody of Songs with 7 tone.\" It  takes only an hour to learn the system. That´s how simple the system is. You don´t believe me? Tell me about it after you learn the system from me.  <strong>Once you have this method, you can spend ONE day to start playing songs by ear in 12 different keys.</strong>  This surpasses the learning curve of traditional music that requires you to read music.  </p>  <p>  \t               To guide you to use the my number system comfortably, I provide many songs for you to work on, so that you get lots of practice to become proficient with the 7-tone music. By the end of the course, you will be able to even notate your own songs in this numeric notation and play songs in different keys.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>My Play By Ear Method 2 totally simplifies the thought process </strong>when you play songs. To me this is most valuable because it frees students from reading the more complicated music staff notation, and helps the student to acquire a QUIET mind to listen to the sounds deeply, to play with ease and with creative freedom.  This is what play by ear is about.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Level: Beginners to Advanced</strong>  </p>    <p>  \t<strong>Video Song Demonstrations:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t               I use software-animated videos that show you clearly how to apply the 7-tone music to playing songs by ear. I first demonstrate how this is easily done in the key of C.  </p>  <strong>Play Songs Easily in all 12 Keys</strong>  <p>  \t               What you can do to the key of C can easily be done to any key, even in the more difficult keys such as Db key, B key or F# key. The thinking and application is CONSISTENT in all 12 keys.  </p>  <p>  \t               In my videos, using different songs, I show you how to apply the 7-tone music to play songs in all 12 different keys. I purposely also choose some of the harder keys to play in (B, Db, Ab) so that you can see how easy the system is once your thinking is clear.  </p>  <strong>Learn to Listen Deeply</strong>  <p>  \t               A lot of ear training programs want to help us to LISTEN DEEPLY to the sounds. My approach uses songs to help you listen DEEPLY to the tones you play rather than naming the intervals such as M6, m6, m2, M2, m7 or M7 etc. If playing songs by ear is what you want, this is perfect for you. If you want to learn sound intervals and distinguish them, you would have to go for ear training software for those drilling exercises.  </p>  <p>  \t               This course is all about playing songs by ear in 12 different keys so that you can play the songs in the key that is in the vocal range for people to sing.  </p>    <p>  \t<strong>Songs in Play By Ear Level 2</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>A.
