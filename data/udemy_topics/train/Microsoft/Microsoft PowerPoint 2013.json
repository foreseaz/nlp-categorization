    "description": "<p>  \t This VTC course moves from a study of the PowerPoint interface through creating presentations with an eye towards reusing already created content whenever possible. You will learn how to add smart art objects, images, drawings, charts, and a/v content to slides. You will also learn about SkyDrive and the PowerPoint WebApp. There is a focus on using those PowerPoint features that are appropriate to the audience and presentation location. Helen Bradley teaches this course from a business perspective, introducing tools that can be used to ensure that PowerPoint presentations are consistently formatted and easy to update. She covers formatting data in tables, using the photo album tool, working with multimedia objects, and preparing a slide show for presentation. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>  <p>  \tWork files for this course can be downloaded from the first lecture.  </p>",
