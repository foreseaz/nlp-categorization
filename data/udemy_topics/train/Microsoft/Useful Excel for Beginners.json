    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    Welcome to the <em style=\"\">Useful Excel for Beginners</em> course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Excel and become an effective user. The target audience for the course are those who have never used Excel before and those who are beginner level users. You would need a copy of Microsoft Excel for Windows since you will be practicing along with the course. I use Excel 2010 for Windows in the videos but any version with Excel 2007 for Windows or later would work. Excel Versions prior to 2007 have a different user interface but concepts will apply.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   As the course is targeting beginners, it has been developed to be very easy to follow. We will be working with data related to a book store in the exercises. The files are available for download and you can follow along the videos while practicing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The course covers the topics that you would need to know, to become a functional user. You can download the Table of Contents document from Chapter 1, to see all the topics the course will address. The course has 89 videos and runs for 9.5 hours.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If there are any questions about the course, please e-mail at indzara at gmail.com  </p>",
