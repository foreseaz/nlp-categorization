Excellent!</strong>\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Types of Excel Charts &amp; Excel Graphs are presented:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The content and type of Excel charts presented are those\nthat are typical to corporate reporting. Given my background in controlling,\nfinance and project management, I designed the training with this audience in\nmind and the typical methods used to report, communicate, analyze, check and\nplan quantitative information. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a student taking this course, rest assured that you are well equipped with advanced Excel visualization &amp; chart design techniques to impress any employer who requires you to create graphs &amp; reports in Excel.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Demonstration will be done using Excel 2010, but all\nmethods will be compatible with older as well as future versions of Excel\nunless otherwise stated in the video. My main focus is to\nintroduce you to new “methods” of doing things which you can do no matter which\nExcel version you have.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why this course is different to other Excel courses:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I will not only demonstrate to you, but you\nwill be able to follow each demonstration in your own Excel workbook. To make sure you have understood the\ntechniques, you will complete an exercise at the end of each section (answers are included but you have to try on your own first). <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I place great value on keeping the training\nnot only informative but also interesting. I know technical courses can be\nboring, especially when taken online. For this reason, I have mixed\nscreen-casts together with talking head and flip chart type of demonstrations to\nget it as close to a classroom training style as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have also been told by many students that I have the ability to explain complex topics in an easy to understand manner. I think you will benefit from that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">This course is split to 5 major parts:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Methods to effectively communicate and present data trends</em> – In this section I will also provide you with a crash course in best practices for table and graph design.</li><li><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Behind the scenes secrets of dynamic charts in Excel</em>, where I introduce you to key functions you need to use to never manually update your Excel charts again –The functions you learn here go beyond graphs and charts.
