    "description": "<p>GET THIS COURSE NOW WHILE IT IS CHEAP - PRICE WILL GO UP VERY SOON</p><p>One of my first students, Rick, messaged me to say \"I thought it was outstanding! It was extremely easy to follow and hit on some critical key points for a beginner.\"</p><p>You should join this active course - I am extremely responsive inside the course answering questions from students and helping them learn Excel. I look forward to working with you, as well. </p><p>The course will gently lead a total beginner through all the steps to create and format a basic spreadsheet.</p><p>It will demystify a lot of jargon, and also provide some killer tips that will save a lot of time, and wow your boss.</p><p>The course assumes no prior knowledge. Each lesson builds on the previous one. So it is designed for you to start at the beginnning and work your way through. However if you prefer, you can jump around and just do the lessons you want.</p><p>In the later lessons I have provided before and after spreadsheets. You do not need to download these, but they are available for your use if you want to.</p><p>I have also given a quiz at the end of each section so that you can test if you have absorbed all the lessons properly.</p><p>Happy Excelling!!!</p><p>Keith</p>",
