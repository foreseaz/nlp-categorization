I don’t blame them. We think that word is all about writing or editing documents which we could learn by trying (remember you never needed a course for just typing)</p>    <p>What if I tell you that there are so many hidden techniques and tricks that will actually save 30-40% your current operating time. Maybe you don’t trust me. Let’s get to the point.</p>    <ul><li>How do you avoid typing out frequently used text?</li><li>Do you know that your clipboard saves up to 24 instances (when you cut/copy)?</li><li>Do you struggle with creating a table of content, list of figures, etc?</li><li>How to you use mail merge by using data from excel?</li></ul>          <p>I didn’t have an answer to all these questions when I started out (I too said – I know it all). However, after working and training professionals on these, I created a short series of hand-picked word trick specially meant for busy Microsoft Word users</p>    <p>This course is a 30-min no-nonsense fast-paced videos with 100% VALUE and a great way to find out word features you never use</p>",
