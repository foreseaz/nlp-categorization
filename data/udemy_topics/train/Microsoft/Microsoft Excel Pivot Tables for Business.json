A pivot table enables you to turn large amounts of data into concise, interactive summary reports in minutes. Despite its power, the Excel pivot table remains a mystery to most Excel users – even to those with years of experience. In this course, <strong>we will </strong><strong>demystify the Excel pivot table</strong>, and <strong>make it accessible to the average Excel user</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t                           No more tedious <em>manual </em><em>sorting</em>, <em>subtotaling</em>, <em>filtering</em> and <em>complex formulas</em> needed to summarize your data like a pro. With pivot tables it’s a point and click, drag and drop experience.  </p>  <p>  \t       The core course for which you are paying is the first 3 sections of the course curriculum. This content will provide a solid foundation in pivot tables.  </p>  <p>  \t             Additional/Free/Bonus sections may be added based on significant user interest and instructor&#039;s time.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Notes: </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong> </strong>There are a few features that were introduced in Excel 2010. About 90% of the content applies to Excel 2007 and later.  </p>  <p>  \t                               The course covers non-OLAP data sources such as Excel ranges and tables -- not multi-dimensional data sources.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Getting Started</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                               Meet me in <strong>Lesson 1</strong> (below), and we can get started.  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                 Best regards,  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                 Bobby Munoz  </p>",
