    "description": "<p>Learn PivotTables during 1 lunch hour!  </p>\n\n<p>Pivot tables are a great way to analyze large volumes of data very quickly.  Pivot tables are extremely flexible and customizable, which makes them such a great tool to have in your toolbox. I can tell you that I use them almost every day in my day job and the feedback I get is, \"How did you that?\", \"That's so cool!\", and \"Damn, I really have to learn pivot tables one day!\"  Well for you, that day is today!</p>\n\n<p>This class is purposely staged to take you about an hour to go through.  At the end of the course, <strong>my objective for you is to make sure you have a basic understanding of how to operate a pivot table and how to practically apply it to situations. </strong> </p>\n\n<p>Also, this class is interactive.  You will have an file in excel to download, and you will be working on it, as we go through the course together.  This is the best way to learn - learn by doing!!</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy this course, and I am confident you will have a basic understanding of pivot tables as you are taking your last bite of dessert!</p>",
