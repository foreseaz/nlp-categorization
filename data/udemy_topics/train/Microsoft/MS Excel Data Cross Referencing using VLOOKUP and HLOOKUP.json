The use of Lookup&#039;s is absolutely essential for the user trying to extract information from long rows or columns of data. This means, that for large or complex sets of data, especially recurring data, one formula can organise/calculate different types of information in one go.  </p>  <p>  \t                   Too many times I see people manually searching for what they need for hours rather than simply creating a Lookup formula. Stop wasting your time doing manual searching. Learn this simple function and make your life easier.  </p>  <p>  \t In this course, I&#039;ll teach you everything from the internal structure of the formula, to linking it between columns to even creating your own search engine.  </p>  <p>  \t                   And you&#039;ll learn all this in around 30 minutes!!  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p><strong style=\"\">Instructor Achievements</strong></p><ol style=\"\"><li>Member of the <strong style=\"\">Udemy Council</strong></li><li><strong style=\"\">+19,000 students</strong> (totalling ~40,000 enrolments)</li><li>Average of <strong style=\"\">300-500 enrolments per day</strong> (Highest enrolment rate in one day was 1400 students)</li><li><strong style=\"\">+500 Positive Reviews</strong> (5 Star Average Rating across all courses)</li><li><strong style=\"\">+18 Live courses</strong> (+20 courses in production)</li><li>Incorporated my Udemy courses into RMIT University Laboratory Tutorials for <strong style=\"\">Undergraduate Aerospace Engineers</strong></li></ol>  <p>  \t                                                                 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Course Details</strong>  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li>This course has the <strong style=\"\">shortest and simplest </strong>tutorial video&#039;s you will ever see!
