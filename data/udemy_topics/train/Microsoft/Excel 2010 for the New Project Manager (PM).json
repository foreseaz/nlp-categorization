You just need to figure out how to use it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      To really understand Excel you should probably start with the basics (and there is a lot to learn!). This course is a lecture only format that gives just enough information to get you started to feel comfortable using Excel to run projects.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This course will cover the following:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Explore the Excel 2010 User Interface</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Understanding the Ribbon</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">A Look at the Backstage view</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Workbook and Worksheet Basics</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Primer to Cells, Columns and Rows</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Exploring different views using Freeze Panes and Split Panes</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to Create Formulas and use Functions</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Using Lists Filters</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How the Table Feature Works</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Basics of Charting</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Formatting Charts</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Using Styles and Text Formatting</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Tips on Printing</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to Create a Gantt Chart</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to Create a Pareto Chart</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to Create a Timeline Chart</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t      There are a lot of things you can do with Excel and <strong style=\"\">this course should give you the tools to really understand how it works.</strong> By the end of the course you should feel familiar with using Excel and may also be able to create some charts that you may see in your work.  </p>",
