    "description": "<p>  \tLooking up data in Excel 2013 is a fun thing. Yet many students find it difficult to search for data in Excel due to arcane explanations provided in help files and tutorials.  </p>  <p>  \t&quot;Looking up&quot;, simply means to search a particular value from a spreadsheet or workbook against a particular value that we know before hand. It can be likened to looking up a word in a dictionary, or a record in a database.  </p>  <p>  \tExcel makes it easy to search for values, both in rows and columns. While there are advanced functions also that enable Excel users to search for data &quot;database-style&quot;, the HLookup and VLookup functions are their simpler-yet-powerful siblings. Simpler? Yeah! Because, why should you use a cannon to shoot a fly?  </p>  <p>  \tAfter this course, whether you want to calculate grades in Gradebooks, design Directories or draw-up Invoices, you&#039;ll be able to do it on your own, and in a jiffy. The course spans about 40 mins, with live examples, practice workbooks to follow along, and chalk board style logic-behind teaching.  </p>  <p>  \tSo....hit it!  </p>",
