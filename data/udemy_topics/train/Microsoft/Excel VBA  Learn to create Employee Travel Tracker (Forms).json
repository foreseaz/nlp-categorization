The other gem in your training are the shortcuts, I found <strong>no other course with the same insights.\"</strong> by Peter Klugsberger, Australia, ex-McKinsey &amp; Co., served various senior roles (CEO, COO) in various companies</em></p>\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>What’s this course all about?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Application</strong> – Managing flight travel itinerary of 1000s of employees. Avoid wrong booking, track cancellations, and ensure proper approval, monthly MIS report – all though Excel UserForm (VBA Macros).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other business automation areas:</strong> Automate Training room booking, Hotel Room booking, Car Booking, booking IT resources and approval of business expenses such as refreshments, conveyance, stationery etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what’s the reason behind developing this course? What problem were you trying to address?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One of our clients reached out to us to help them <strong>manage travel itinerary of 1000s of employees</strong>. The travel desk in-charge and 1000s of employees from different locations interacted over emails for the purpose of flight tickets request, booking, cancellation, changes, reminders etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There were no standardised form or process for this exercise. Collating month-end report was close to impossible. There were other multiple issues like lack of internal controls, duplicate bookings, incorrect passenger details, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s what we thought…</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s <strong>make a simple to use automated system using Excel VBA. </strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One <strong>travel desk </strong>manager will input the details of travel request (passenger names, travel source &amp; destination, date) by accessing a <strong>common Excel worksheet</strong>. Generic details like employees’ Passport No., Email, Contact No. will be automatically filled in the input form. These details will be sent in a pre-defined format via email to respective employees &amp; to the approval authority.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do I need to know VBA Programming?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.
