Those who do can save more time, and make more money.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a VBA beginner's course that will get you on the road to being in that elite group of VBA programmers.</p><p>Learning to program can seem daunting at first, but I'm going to make it as easy as possible.</p><p>With that said, VBA is a huge topic, and yes, there are a lot of lectures in this course.<br></p><p>But don't try to take it in all at once.</p><p>If you feel like you can do 1 section a week, do 1 section a week.</p><p>If you have time, do 1 section a day.</p><p>But don't stress out.</p><p><br></p><p>And because VBA is a huge topic, I don't go through every single thing, every method, every property, every shortcut.<br></p><p>What I do go over will get you from, \"<em>I don't even like looking at VBA</em>\", to, <em>\"I can do this!\"</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>NOTE: There are multiple ways to get the same result in VBA.</p><p>So the way I write a procedure or two might be slightly different than your co-workers code, or yours, and that's O.K.</p><p><br></p><p>So I invite you to take a look at the circiulum, and the Preview lectures.</p><p>If you feel this is the course for you, great, let's go ahead and get started, and I will help start programming your Excel workbooks with VBA</p>",
