    "description": "<p>This course is made up of over 70 video lectures, divided into 11 sections and is more than 6 hours long. Assuming that the student takes one lecture per day, this course will take approximately 2 and half months to complete. More lectures can however be taken in a day, which enables the student to complete in a shorter period. It is advisable to practise and apply the excel functions in order to firmly grasp these functions and tools <br></p><p>The course is designed for excel users with basic skills and would like to upgrade their skills to advanced level. As the course name \"Integrated Excel for Advanced Analysis and Reporting\" suggests, the main focus is on analysis of data and reporting using Excel's advanced functions and tools. The course will benefit mostly those students involved in analysis and reporting functions. Nonetheless, as the course covers Excel's key functions used in most organisations, the course still adds value even to users in other spheres<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
