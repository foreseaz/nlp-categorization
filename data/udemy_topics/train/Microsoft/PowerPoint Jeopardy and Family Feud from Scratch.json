    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Welcome! Be prepared to WOW your audiences with unique and awesome-looking games using PowerPoint. Your students/audiences will literally ask you &quot;</span><em><strong>what program is that</strong>?</em><span>&quot; while you&#039;re playing. They won&#039;t BELIEVE that such awesome-looking and FUNCTIONAL games can be made and executed using PowerPoint.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Playing games is a great way to LEARN and RETAIN information. The retention rate is RIDICULOUSLY high and the fun/rapport generated is immeasurable.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              You&#039;ll find a few templates online, but:  </p>  <ol>  \t<li>They are hideously ugly, not professional-looking, and an EMBARRASSMENT to your skills expertise. <strong>Let&#039;s make great looking games so your audience will know that you respect them enough</strong> to <strong><u>not </u></strong>use pre-built templates that look like garbage.</li>  \t<br>  \t<li>They&#039;re made by someone else, so...what you see is what you get. And don&#039;t bother trying to make changes; you&#039;ll just get FRUSTRATED and DISCOURAGED.</li>  \t<br>  \t<li>You don&#039;t learn anything using someone else&#039;s stuff. <strong>Learn to build games from scratch for complete control over what goes in, and most importantly, what comes out.</strong></li>  </ol>  <p>  \t              You will create two <strong>very</strong> popular games that you can use for <strong>any</strong> occasion: <strong><u>Jeopardy</u> </strong>and <u><strong>Family Feud</strong></u>. Your audience will not have a learning curve on how to play...everyone can just jump right in!  </p>  <p>  \t           You will learn a lot while building your own game! You&#039;ll use many of PowerPoint&#039;s features to create a functional, highly-responsive game such as:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Advanced animation techniques</li>  \t<li>Triggers</li>  \t<li>Shape building (2013) or Shape manipulation (2010, 2007)</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t          The PowerPoint games you&#039;ll create can be used for COUNTLESS occasions such as:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Bible studies</li>  \t<li>Academic classroom environments</li>  \t<li>Holiday parties </li>  \t<li>Club tournaments</li>  \t<li>Baby showers</li>  \t<li>Game nights</li>  \t<li><strong><u>AND MORE</u></strong>!</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t          But enough reading...<strong>let&#039;s get to building</strong>!  </p>",
