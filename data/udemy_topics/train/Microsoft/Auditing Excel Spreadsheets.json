Following this will be more theory, this time covering a detailed overview of the types of Spreadsheet Fraud. With the theory finished, we will jump into Excel and look at the following tools and techniques: GOTO Special, Auditing Tools and Excelâ€™s Inquire function. GOTO Special Function has been around for a long time in Excel and quickly allows you select cells in a worksheet based on set criteria. You will have a workbook to download so that you can practice and master this technique yourself. We will also quickly look at the Auditing Tools, which have also been available in Excel for some time. Introduced in MS Excel 2013, Excel Inquire is new. It enables you quickly identify and select areas of risk or interest in a workbook, map workbook relationships and compare two versions of a workbook. Using the workbook provided you can learn to quickly master this tool. Finally, we will have a quick look at Microsoft Discovery and Risk Assessment Server which allows you search for all Excel files on your server, and rank them according to risk. Risk levels are based on Materiality and complexity criteria that you set.  </p>",
