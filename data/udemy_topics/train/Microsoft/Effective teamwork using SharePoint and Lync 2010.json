    "description": "<p>  \t During the past ten years technology has revolutionized the way we work together. Products such as Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Lync enable teams to easily collaborate and communicate with each other in real time. Even though these products are easy to get started with, you might not always know how to best use them in a business context to improve your, and your teams&rsquo; productivity.  </p>  <p>  \t In this course you will learn from a business productivity expert how to use the full power of Microsoft SharePoint and Lync 2010 to collaborate and communicate more effectively. Among other things, you will learn how to get better coordinated as a team using shared task lists, how to produce higher quality documents by using publishing processes with version control and how to incorporate real-time communication into your daily work to get faster results.
