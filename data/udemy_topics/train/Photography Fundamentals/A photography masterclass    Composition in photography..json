A camera alone cannot make a great photo. Only your compositional skills and imagination can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You already have imagination, creativity and talent</strong>, even if you don't fully realise it yet.  What you need in order to translate all of those qualities into a photograph, is compositional skill.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Concentrating on my own personal approach to photography and composition, this course will teach you how to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">turn what you see in your minds eye into a photograph that turns heads</strong> and draws the viewer in.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Composition isn’t just about the dry technical stuff. It’s about <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">your emotional engagement with your surroundings</strong> and having moments of inspiration. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s about the process of translating that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">moment of inspiration</strong> into a photograph that makes people who have never met you or have never been to that location want to look and linger and wonder at the photograph that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you</strong> created.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What I do in this course is to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">communicate an organic and natural learning process</strong>, similar to my own self taught learning process but with reference to the standard rules of composition, which helps to provide a structure for the course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I am still acutely aware of the compositional mistakes I made when starting out, so I factor that knowledge into the tuition you will receive  in this course, which will<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">  help you to accelerate your own learning.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I will teach you how to spot a composition</strong>, and then what to do to make sure that what you see in your minds eye is what we end up seeing when we view your images.<br></p>",
