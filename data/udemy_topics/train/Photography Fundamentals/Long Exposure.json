Like usual I keep it simple and show you how to get a very amazing result quickly and easily.  </p>  <p>  \t      I bring you along to 4 of my shoots and show you how I took the shot and give you the raw files to retouch along with me. Then we retouch another bonus batch of 4 photos where I teach you all about the retouching process, composition, how I got the shot and how to set up your camera to get these types of shots and effects.  </p>",
