Even though hiring a professional photographer is ideal, sometimes it just isn't in your budget or you just don't have time.  This course will teach you every step of the process starting with preparing a home for photography and then how to photograph each scene with a DSLR, a point-and-shoot, and a smartphone.  Consisting almost entirely of HD video demonstrations, this class is as close to a hands-on learning experience as you can get.  </p>",
