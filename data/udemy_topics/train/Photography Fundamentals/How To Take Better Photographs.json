    "description": "<p style=\"\"><p style=\"\">Years ago  BEFORE I was a professional photographer, I thought that I took nice pictures.  I had a great camera and big heavy expensive lens and a good eye for art, but I  was a TERRIBLE photographer. This was in film days where you had to wait to see  your pictures developed before you realized that you missed the boat  completely! As a professional photographer for the past eight years, I have  studied under some of the best lighting and posing experts in the world and I  would like to bring you some attainable, easy tips that will ensure that you  get great photographs of your family, friends and trips. In this “Photography for Beginners: How to  Take Good Photos” course I will also teach you how to create digital scrapbook  pages in Photoshop and the importance of printing your photographs to preserve  them for future generations.</p>    <p style=\"\">Take this Photography for Beginners course  and learn how to take good photos.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
