    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Now that you&#039;ve bought an amazing new DSLR, you need a video that goes  beyond the camera manual to teach you how to compose great shots. In  this video, professional photographer Nicole Young takes you into the  studio and on location to show you how to arrange components in a photo  based on the way a viewer&#039;s eye travels through an image. With Nicole as  your guide, you&#039;ll learn how to create compelling images whether you&#039;re  shooting portraits, landscapes, or action.<br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t Nicole starts with  the basics of composition, showing you how to apply the rule of thirds  to create interest in your shots and work the elements of color, shape,  angles, and contrast to bring your own unique expression to any  situation. She covers changing shutter speed to convey motion, working  with aperture to create depth of field, and more. Then she takes you  into Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom to show you how to  fine-tune your images through cropping and other adjustments.  </p>",
