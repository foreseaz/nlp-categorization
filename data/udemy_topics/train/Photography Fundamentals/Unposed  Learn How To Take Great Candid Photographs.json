    "description": "<p>Often, people are asking me about what \"style\" of photography I shoot, especially for weddings.  The real question that they are asking is whether or not I will capture many candid photos of them and their guests.  The answer is \"of course!\".  No matter the style of photography that you typically shoot, candid photos are always a popular choice.  Many times people feel that they look most authentic when they are not looking at the camera, or better yet, when they do not know that the camera is watching them.  (Not in a creepy way!)</p><p>If you want to master this popular style of photography, please sign up for my course as I am sure it will give you some insight into how candid photos can really mean a lot to people.</p><p>In this course, I will unveil six tricks that I use when planning to capture people in their natural state.  You will also learn my definition of \"candid\" photos as well as photo-journalism.  I love answering any questions that my students may have, so feel free to use the discussion board within the course setting to learn additional tips.</p><p>I look forward to teaching you about candid photography!</p>",
