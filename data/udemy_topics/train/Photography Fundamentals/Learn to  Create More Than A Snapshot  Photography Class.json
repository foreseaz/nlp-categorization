    "description": "<p>\t Learn with more than 2,000 of my other students currently learning to improve their photography skills. This course will help you to understand how to use your camera, develop higher level photographic techniques, and to make more creative images.</p>\n\n<p>\t This course is composed of videos, worksheets, assignments and critiques to help guide you through learning digital photography. The course has about 57 lessons and I'm constantly adding new lessons. As an added bonus, I will add you to a private Facebook group (or on udemy) so you can post questions.</p>\n\n<p>\t This course is like having your own photography coach. This class will keep you shooting and practicing all year long and practice is the only way you will get better at anything.</p>\n\n<p>\t Last updated 4/21/2016</p>\n\n<p>I have never given this course away for free so my student numbers are not deceptively inflated as you may see on other udemy courses.</p>",
