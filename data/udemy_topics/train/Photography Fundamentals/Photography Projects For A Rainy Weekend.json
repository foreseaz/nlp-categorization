Being stuck at home during bad weather  doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t create visually interesting photos. Over the almost 2  hours of video tutorials on indoor photography we&#039;ll look at ideas for self-portraits,  food and drink photography, product photography and some creative techniques  with water, flowers and smoke. Also included are PDF lighting diagrams  describing the light source and positioning and some DIY indoor photography  ideas  that allow you to make your own photography gear.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
