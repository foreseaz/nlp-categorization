( Just in case YOU dont know)</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Airbnb is a massive network of owners and guests that only seems to be growing bigger as the economy continues to tank and spendable income continues to shrink.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2015, Airbnb has hosted over 10 million guest stays at more than 550,000 properties across 175 countries and 26,000 cities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 6 million guest stays in 2013, more than double the total in 2012. Of these 6 million stays, only 1/3 were within the United States. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remainder was spread across the globe, further supporting the fact that Airbnb has a substantial international presence that is only getting stronger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is the perfect time to take advantage of this incredible opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So FACTS about AirBNB:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"To date, tens of millions of travelers have chosen Airbnb to experience cities not as tourists, but as locals.\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"</strong><strong>Airbnb travelers stay longer and spend more in diverse neighborhoods throughout the city.\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\"</strong><strong>Hundreds of thousands of hosts worldwide have welcomed these travelers into their homes.

Last year alone, they booked 10 million rental nights in homes, apartments, rooms, and spaces just like yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you really earn Full-time Income using \"AirBnb\" ?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES YOU CAN..........A private room on <strong>Airbnb rents for an average $120 / night.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average amount an Airbnb host earns annually from temporarily renting out their space is <strong>$7,350...</strong>think for a second..what could you do with an extra <strong>$7,350 per year?</strong><strong></strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>People all over the world are constantly on the go and traveling.
