    "description": "<p>If you want to move to Canada, this is the course for you. The course outlines the entire process of immigrating to Canada, right from the things you need to do before you apply to the things you should do after arriving in Canada. An immigration consultant or an agency usually charges upwards of $2000 for their services. With this course, you won't need their services. You can file your application and go through the process yourself. In this course, you will find only the relevant information required for the immigration process. You will not be confused, unlike when you read the scattered information on immigration websites. I have also presented my experience in filing the application.</p>",
