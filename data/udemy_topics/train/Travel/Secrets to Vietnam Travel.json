    "description": "<p>  \t    Have you ever dreamed of traveling to Southeast Asia or visiting some of the pristine far away beaches you always see on TV? In this course I&#039;m going to show you places in Vietnam that you wouldn&#039;t even believe existed, especially not for the prices that you&#039;ll see.  </p>  <p>  \t    The truth about travel is that the best experiences you&#039;ll ever have usually aren&#039;t at resorts you see advertised on TV because everybody else is also seeing those advertisements and planning trips there, AND those places charge a premium price.  </p>  <p>  \t    But once you&#039;ve traveled around the world you start to realize there are some absolutely unbelievable places that most tourists will NEVER find. In this course, I&#039;m going to show you some of the places that I found in my five years living in Vietnam.  </p>  <p>  \t    I&#039;ll show you the best beaches (some of them totally secret to this day), the best restaurants and night clubs in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), and many more destinations that other tourists and backpackers will never find in a guidebook or other travel literature.  </p>  <p>  \tI have also included my Vietnam travel secrets eBook, <strong style=\"\">5 Secrets to Vietnam Travel. </strong>The tips in this eBook alone are worth more than the price of the course.  </p>  <p>  \t    It took me many years of travel and living abroad to compile this information so I hope you take advantage of this opportunity to plan the trip of a lifetime!  </p>",
