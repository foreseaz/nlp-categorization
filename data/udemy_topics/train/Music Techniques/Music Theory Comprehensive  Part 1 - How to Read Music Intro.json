The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I like these courses because you can get up and running quickly without having to spend hours of time wading through TMI (too much information!). Jason hits the high points but shows you what you need to know. Thanks!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I've watched many other videos on scales and chords before, however, this one has been the best. I now understand minor scales and chords and even how to analyze songs. It really gave me the confidence to start producing music because I feel like I have some structure and guidelines to follow. AWESOME!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Clear and Informative - Jason has a clear uncluttered style (with the important dashes of humor) of presentation that is focused on the important key aspects of this course. Recommended for those starting out!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Dr. Allen does it again with his music theory series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section, and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn't aware of.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"The Best Teacher Ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all means without giving what you don't want to know.\"</em></li></ul>",
