    "description": "<p>  \t   Vocal riffs and runs are a skill that most of today's top selling Pop, R&amp;B and Gospel vocalists seem to have mastered.  They're often performed quickly and expressively.  Riffs and runs add artistic flair to a vocal performance.  </p>  <p>  \t   This program is designed to give musicians vocalists introductory exposure to riffs and runs.  It begins with a brief introduction explaining, with demonstrations, the difference between a \"riff\" and a \"run\".  </p>  <p>  \t   The introduction is followed by a systematic, progressive explanation of the pentatonic scale and its 5 inversions.  The exercises themselves are in the key of D major and the listener can choose a lower octave than demonstrated depending on his/her preference.  </p>  <p>  \t    Finally, non-pentatonic Riffs and Runs are explored with mp3 tracks to supplement.  </p>  <p>  \t It takes about an hour to complete the course, but the skills introduced should be regularly reinforced by practice for a period of at least 8 months.  </p>  <p></p>",
