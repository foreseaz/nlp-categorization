    "description": "<p style=\"\"><p style=\"\">Traditional classroom management approaches tend to focus on  getting students to comply with rules through the use of extrinsic rewards and  punishments. These coercive approaches produce, at best, short-term obedience  and have the potential to thwart the development of many positive student  behaviors and dispositions that we promote in our classrooms. This effective classroom management  course presents an alternative classroom management approach rooted in  intrinsic motivation and designed to create a learning environment in which  children work hard, work together, and work with purpose. </p>    <p style=\"\">This effective  classroom management course is divided into four sections that contain a  total of 20 video presentations. It will take approximately 5 hours to complete  the effective classroom  management course.</p>    <p style=\"\">Take this ultimate effective classroom management course  right now.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
