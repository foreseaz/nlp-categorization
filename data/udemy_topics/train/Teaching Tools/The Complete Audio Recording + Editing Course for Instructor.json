Every week, I see frustrated instructors posting messages begging for help in figuring out *why* their audio is being rejected and *how* to get their course approved so they can start earning a return on all the investment they’ve made in creating their course. While Arun does recommend buying a software, when there are other free options, he correctly teaches that in order to get a professional result, you’re going to have to invest a little bit of money. While hobbyists might be able to slide by with free software (if they have a really quiet, echo-free recording environment &amp; a quality microphone), anyone seeking to earn a living on Udemy should view buying Adobe Audition &amp; this course as worthwhile investments that will easily give them a return on investment within their first few sales.</em><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><u>Social Proof:</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; 800+ Satisfied students</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; 11 Positive reviews</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; 3 Hours of Organized and Polished HD Lectures</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Complete Captions (English Subtitles)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Personal Assistance to get your Test Video + Course Approved</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Offline access via Udemy app for Android &amp; iOS</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Course Completion Certificate</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; 30 Day money back guarantee</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Are you planning to upgrade your Mic to remove noise from your voice or Audio recording?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>&gt; Are you searching for the best Mic to record vocals?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Stop searching! </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can correct all the issues you face, with Adobe Audition CC.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t get shocked, your Smartphone Mic or a $50 like Samson Go / Blue Snowball Mic can do wonders! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You don't even need a shock-mount or a Pop filter!</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Raja Biswas says,</strong> \"Great course..
