    "description": "<p>Chromebooks are incredible for the classroom! They provide engaging learning and collaboration. However, they also can be the greatest distraction. With the entire world at their fingertips, students can get off topic and pointlessly wander the online world.</p>\n\n<p>How do schools solve this problem? Often, there is only two choices: walk the rows and watch screens or simply hope everyone is staying on task. Wouldn't it be great if educators had the ability to uncover exactly what students are doing, like their own version of educational ESP?</p>\n\n<p>SecondSite gives technicians and teachers the ability to track all student Internet activity, detect objectionable content, search for time wasting activities and empower them to keep students engaged.</p>\n\n<p>The class begins by explaining the top recommended Chrome policies to keep students safe and secure. You will learn how to deploy the extension in minutes and immediately begin monitoring. From there, discover features like email communication, screen viewing,Â and Watch Groups. Finally, enable the content filter to detect and block objectionable words and URLs.</p>\n\n<p>This class will allow you to control your Chromebooks and make you an expert with SecondSite!</p>",
