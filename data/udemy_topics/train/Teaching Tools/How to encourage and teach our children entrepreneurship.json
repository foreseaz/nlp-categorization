    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is about encouraging your kids  to make and save money.&nbsp; I define a <strong style=\"\">kid entrepreneur</strong> as a young  person who makes money, can save the money, and handle all the responsibilities  of school, family, and friends.&nbsp; There is a very strong possibility that  someday your child will become an entrepreneur.&nbsp; Schools are not teaching  entrepreneurship, because they don&#039;t know how.&nbsp;But, I do. I produced 10  lessons that will guide you to becoming an entrepreneur coach.&nbsp; Each  whiteboard lesson is between 7 and 15 minutes.&nbsp; Notes are included with each lesson.&nbsp; Most of the lessons have  homework, which are activities for you and your child to do together. &nbsp;  Making and saving money builds self-esteem and confidence.</p>    ",
