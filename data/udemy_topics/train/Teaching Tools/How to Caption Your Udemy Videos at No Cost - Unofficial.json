    "description": "<p>This course is not sponsored by or affiliated with Udemy, Inc.<br></p>\n\n<p style=\"\">  \tClosed captioning is a subtitling system designed to make television more accessible to the hearing-impaired. Unlike movie subtitles, which are intended to translate dialogue for people who can hear the rest of the soundtrack, closed captions need to convey all important sound effects, music cues, nonverbal expressions, and dialogue that occur as a program plays. Subtitles and closed captions open up your content to a larger audience, including deaf or hard of hearing viewers or those who speak other languages. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tThis course will show you how to caption your Udemy Videos using a very easy and Free process.
