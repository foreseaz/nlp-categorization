    "description": "<p>This course opens up doors of opportunity for communication you will wonder how you lived without. It is just Keynote basics but from here it opens up avenues for better presentations, digital story telling, even video production for YouTube!</p>\n\n<p>While I am a teacher and teachers will potentially get the most out of this course (and the Digital Communication Mastery course that follows it) anyone interested in reaching a wider audience and developing professional looking materials will be able to make huge strides.</p>\n\n<p>You don't need to be an artist to make this work for you. Learn the basics here and then jump in for more in the following course and additions. Short lectures and quizzes make it easy to digest and manage on a busy schedule. The entire course can be managed in one sitting if you have the time or over a few short sessions. Take the challenges and go further developing your skills.</p>\n\n<p>If you are an educator you will want to share what you have learned with your students K-12 or university. Everyone needs these digital age skills. </p>\n\n<p>Get on board now. You will have fun creating original work and leave hungry for more.</p>\n\n<p>#21st century communication<br>#creativity<br>#present better<br>#walk the walk<br>#look like a total pro</p>",
