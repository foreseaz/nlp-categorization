    "description": "<p>This online instructor training course is ideal for any dancer or instructor wishing to share the beautiful dance style of Brazilian Zouk with others. In each of the 26 training videos, each beginner-level Zouk move or concept is clearly broken down with explanations of how to teach it to a group of students.  The material is structured according to the Black Belt Dance(tm) system and constitutes the White Belt level (first level) of the Black Belt Zouk syllabus.  Having completed this course you will be able to competently teach the White Belt level of the Black Belt Zouk syllabus to a group of students. Even if you charge only $60 for a 4-week course you need only TWO students for two months to cover the investment of this instructor training. You will also be able to apply for examination for Black Belt Zouk certification (examination fees and additional conditions may apply).</p>",
