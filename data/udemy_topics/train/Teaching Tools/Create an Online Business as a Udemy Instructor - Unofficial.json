Jake, great course! This is my second \"course\" that I have gone through, and man do you deliver. This set out to teach you how to make and deliver an informational product, and that's exactly what it does. By following these easy 1, 2, 3 steps (or more), you can go out today and start creating info products. <strong style=\"\">Nothing is left out here</strong>. So many times I feel like a piece of the puzzle is missing in a \"method\" or \"formula\" that is taught, not here! <strong style=\"\">You hit it right on the head with this one</strong>. No questions were left unanswered, you teach us how to get from step one, to step two, to step three and beyond until completion. This course took a little over 2 hours to go through all the videos. Once again -- none of this will happen unless the student takes ACTION - but you're giving the map, just follow and you will end up where at your destination! Great job. <strong style=\"\">A+++</strong>\" - Susan</em></p><p><em style=\"\"><span></span>\"Excellent, engaging video course on Product Creation - <strong style=\"\">I highly recommend</strong>. The course provided very detailed, step by step instructions on Product Creation. Jake is engaging and you can see how knowledgeable, engaging and passionate he is about the subject. The use of videos together with his on-camera presentation, made the course very valuable for me. I have read and watched other Products Creation courses, and <strong style=\"\">this one is by far superior to them all</strong>. I have always been leary about creating my own product, but this course shows how doable the process is. I cannot say enough about the quality in this series of videos - <strong style=\"\">I highly recommend it to anyone</strong>.\" - </em><em style=\"\">RoseMarie Pierre</em></p><p><em style=\"\">\"My view on Product Creation Formula.. </em><em style=\"\">I have been trying to create info products for the past few years and getting absolutely nowhere. To be honest, I'd reached my tipping point and was on the verge of giving up and going back to the nine-to-five drudge. Without trying to sound like a drama queen, Jake's course was going to be my last bash at this whole thing. </em><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">I am so glad I did</strong>. At last, a course that comes in bite-size pieces and <strong style=\"\">takes you through the whole process and leaves nothing out</strong>. I am now full of confidence that I can actually do this thing.. </em><em style=\"\">This course will help even newbies, or should I say, especially newbies. And don't forget, you can come back to it any time you're stuck, which I've done myself. It's a <strong style=\"\">brilliant, step-by-step course that I highly recommend</strong>. </em><em style=\"\">Thank you Jake.\" - Ray Cowie</em></p><p><strong style=\"\">----------</strong></p><p><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">LATEST:</strong> Course has been updated with all new material for the current Udemy market!</em></p><p><strong style=\"\">Start earning a truly residual income</strong> with no outlay and no technical experience needed.
