It's a mystery. Maybe it's karma. Maybe it's what you chose before you incarnated into you. Maybe if you work the Law of Attraction, it will get you what you want.  </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  \t I don't know if any business is easy but I do know <strong style=\"\">that it is about attracting and working with clients</strong> - working with them in a unique way so that their experience is everything it can be. That means that you will be honing your skills and growing as a coach and a human being for as long as you live.  </p>  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">  \t You can apply this training to any kind of coaching or you can use it to complete some of the requirements to be a YOU University Coach <em style=\"\">(must complete YOU University first to be a YOU University coach. Other requirements upon request. You can email me at maiaberens@youuniversityonline.com.)</em>  </p>",
