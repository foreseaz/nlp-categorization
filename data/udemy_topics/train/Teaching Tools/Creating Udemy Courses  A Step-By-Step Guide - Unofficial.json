What I learned from him helped me decide <strong>exactly what niche to focus on, how to create a high-value course and then how to launch and leverage Udemy platform for passive income</strong>. I will never forget a day when I made my first 1$ online and then after a few days, first 100$ online (I am now well into thousands per month). Thank you Scott!\" -</em>Bozidar Jovicevic</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"As a fitness instructor and business owner, I knew I wanted to create something that would get me paid without requiring me to show up and log all the long hours of labor that are usually required in my line of business. Scott introduced me to UDEMY and changed everything for me. <strong>The man is a total beast on the platform and was very helpful in getting me started making passive income with a Udemy course</strong>. Could not be more grateful for his help!\" </em>-Brandon Epstein</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To Instructors who already had courses...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"I published my first course on Udemy two years ago, and it became one of the Top 5 Business courses on the site. I had worn out all my traditional marketing strategies and didn't know what else to do to attract more students and grow my income. S<strong>cott gave me one idea that allowed me to get 2,000 new students in less than a week</strong> - and I didn't need to spend a dime on marketing! I can't wait to continue riding the wave with Scott as Udemy explodes\"</em> -Tom Corson Knowles</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"When I created my recent Udemy course, I followed many of Scott's best practices for social proof, reviews, pricing, promotion, and more. <strong>The course earned over $3500 in the first 2 months.</strong> It was a lot of work to create the videos and the material, but now I have what I hope to be a passive income asset that will serve me for months or years down the road.\"</em> - Nick Loper</p>",
