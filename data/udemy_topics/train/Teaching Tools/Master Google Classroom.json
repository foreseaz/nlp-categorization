    "description": "<p>Google Classroom will change your life! Remember the old days of making copies, handing out assignments, tracking student work, and manually grading? Google Classroom reinvents those time consuming tasks by introducing a paperless program that actually works. First, you will receive an introduction to the app and learn why it was developed. You'll move immediately into creating your first class. Then, go step by step into creating, distributing, collecting and grading assignments. Discover the advanced tools like drafts, invitations, calendars, and email notifications. Finally, learn how to properly communicate with students individually, or via posts, announcements and questions. With all that knowledge, you will become an incredible teacher in the cloud!</p>",
