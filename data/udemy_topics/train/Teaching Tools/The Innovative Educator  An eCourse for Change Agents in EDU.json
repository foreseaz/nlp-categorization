    "description": "<p>  \t  The truth is, innovation is like your health. If you treat it like a fad diet, you&#039;ll get frustrated and exhausted. If you develop good habits, then you&#039;ll see results that will engage your students like you&#039;ve never seen before. This class will uncover those habits, first introduced in this Huffington Post article, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courtney-oconnell/5-habits-of-highly-innovative-educators_b_4639434.html?utm_hp_ref=tw\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">5 Habits of Innovative Educators</a>. The foundation of the course includes 6 high-quality video lectures from the instructor. However, the best part about this course is the curated content! Guest lectures from innovators in and outside of education, innovation case studies written by innovative educators, and TWO live Q&amp;A sessions with innovation thought leaders.  </p>  <p>  \t  Courtney has years of experience in teaching, and has a niche for creating highly engaging virtual content. She has previous experience in teaching innovative leadership at Rutgers University. The course will include videos, case studies, worksheets/resources and experiential exercises to engage the class in a variety of ways that help to develop the habits of innovative educators.  </p>",
