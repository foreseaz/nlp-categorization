Now it is a global phenomenon with over 70 million users and engagement through the roof. 80% of pins are repins which means it is <strong style=\"\">much easier to go viral on Pinterest than on any other social network</strong>.</p><p style=\"\">I currently have over 20,000 Pinterest followers, and some of my pins have been liked and repinned over 1,000 times. All of this engagement has led to direct traffic to my blog, landing pages, and sales pages.</p><p style=\"\">In this course, I will share with you the methods you can use to dominate Pinterest by growing a targeted audience and optimizing your pins so they spread far and wide.</p><p style=\"\">All you have to do to get lifetime access to all of the lectures on my course and the lectures I add in the future is to click the &quot;Take This Course&quot; button.
