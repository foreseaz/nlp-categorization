I'm here to guide you towards more views and closer to success on Youtube!</p>\n\n<p>I started working on my Youtube channel in August 2014 and 2 years later I'm at over 100,000 subscribers generating enough income to treat it as a full time job. </p><p>It took me until September 2015 to actually completely learn about what I'm doing. As soon as I did, my channel went from 12,000 to 80,000 subscribers in 2 months.</p><p><em><strong></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Please understand,<strong> </strong><strong>very quick success</strong> is extremely <strong>unlikely</strong><strong> </strong>so you must understand that Youtube will probably be your <strong>hobby for the first year</strong>, it might be less and it might be more, it all depends on your willingness to implement the knowledge you gain from this course.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>purpose</strong><strong> </strong>of this course is to give you the idea of how Youtube works and what you need to do to grow your channel. It serves as a guide to make you understand the technical aspects of growth on Youtube.
