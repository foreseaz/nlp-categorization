In <em>Making the Most of Twitter</em>, I show you how to get started with this powerful and versatile social media tool. With nearly two hours of video material (with full transcripts), I walk you through Twitter’s main features, providing many examples of how it can be used to promote and share your research, and also to find useful information. We’ll cover the absolute basics before moving on to more sophisticated techniques and third-party tools to enhance your Twitter experience.</p>    <p>Some of the questions I address include:</p>    <ul>  <li>How do I share my research on Twitter?</li>  <li>Who should I talk to, and how do I find them?</li>  <li>How much time should I spend on Twitter?</li>  <li>What shouldn’t I say?</li>  <li>How can I measure my effectiveness on Twitter?</li>  <li>What <em>can’t</em>      Twitter do?</li>  <li>How do I avoid the pitfalls?</li></ul>",
