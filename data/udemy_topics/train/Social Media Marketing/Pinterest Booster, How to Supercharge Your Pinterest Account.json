    "description": "<p>You should take this course if you want to make your Pinterest account work for you, whether that means promoting a website or a Facebook Page, a blog or a voluntary organisation for example. This video course uses examples of my own Pinterest Account and other websites to show how to gain followers, repins, likes etc to your Pinterest Account. I know it works because it is the same method I used to build my own Account. All you need really is a computer or laptop with an internet connection. The course details how to easily get more followers, re-pins and likes to your account both organically through group boards and also using various websites. You should be able to learn all the aspects of the course within an hour really but putting them into practice will be an ongoing thing for as long as you wish.</p>",
