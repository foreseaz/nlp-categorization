I discovered that this tool could help me in a number of different ways.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn short, I’d discovered a free, time saving way of driving traffic, communicating with customers and building a dialogue with a targeted audience. If I was to try to do this via other methods – I would have a range of things to manage and a lot more time would be needed to reproduce these results. Not bad for just a few minutes spent setting up and writing my ‘mini-blog’!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I discovered was a way to revolutionise my online marketing and achieve outstanding success faster and more effectively.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tNow I’m ready to share my knowledge to help you do the same!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this series of Udemy tutorial videos I'll take you step by step from signing up for a Twitter account, to fine-tuning your account to get followers.\n</p>",
