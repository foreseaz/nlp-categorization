As of March 2014, more than 49.5% of LinkedIn users have underperforming personal brands on the network.  </p>  <p>  \tThere are a variety of reasons that contribute to that. Their profiles are incomplete. Their status updates underperform. Their networks are too small for what they want to accomplish. However, LinkedIn has become a powerful resource for me, as I’ve used it to launch many of my businesses, services and products, and I’m looking forward to teaching you how you can do the same.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you’ve taken the first course in this series, Creating an Awesome Profile, then you’re ready to start growing your network. There are a variety of ways to do this within LinkedIn, and we’re going to cover the most common methods in this course as well as giving you an understanding of the different types of LinkedIn networkers you’re likely to encounter. I hope you enjoy it!  </p>",
