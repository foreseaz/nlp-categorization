Facebook has become the clear leader in advertising online, but without an ad that is positioned to get people to click (and the right content on the other side of that ad), you are just throwing your money away.</p><p>Through video lectures and plenty of great ad examples, you will learn how to create Facebook Ads that will get people to click.</p><p>There are plenty of courses which will teach you how to run ads, how to target audiences, and how to get cheap clicks, but very few of them teach you how to create smart, compelling ads. Inside this course you will discover how to find and use the right images, right colors, and right ad copy for your ads - and how to create beautiful Facebook Ads even if you aren't a designer.</p>",
