Manny's course is in the top two. LOTS of excellent tips on how to set up and grow your youtube channel. He even offers templates on the channel art, the video description, the thumbnails, etc. I'm very pleased with this course, and I highly recommend it if you're wanting to get started on youtube. I was averaging 100 subs per month. After implementing most of these tips, I'm a few subs shy of 300 per month --and still growing! I say most tips, because I haven't had the time to do everything yet.
