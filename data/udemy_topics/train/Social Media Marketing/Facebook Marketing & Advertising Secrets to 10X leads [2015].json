What he shared was instrumental in my testing out a couple of different ads and learning how to tweak in order to get the desired result.

This course was very well presented and uncovers some real golden nuggets to help you get better results from your Facebook ad campaigns. If you have done any Facebook or PPc advertising you will soon realise the value of this training. The presenter highlights some really important information regarding setting up campaigns, retargeting and ad spend. Get this wrong and it will hit you in the pocket - I know...I&#039;ve been there. If you are new to Facebook Advertising please do yourself a big favour and take this course and then thank me later for the information you receive. Most courses of this nature are all about selling T Shirts and other stuff but this training sets you on the right path without risking losing your shirt... or... you&#039;re T Shirt for that matter!

Many.. many marketers, online advertisers, and business owners are getting the same results and are wondering if it really works for them. In fact, long time when I started my first online business, way before I became a digital marketing consultant, I struggled as much and my campaigns were just a failure after another..    My CTR was roaming around 0.03 - to 0.05, and I was getting low quality audience who would never spend a dime on any of my products…    I was wondering if it doesn’t really work, how come others are still doing it?    Over the years, I learned how create the <strong style=\"\">most successful and savvy Facebook campaigns</strong>, at a real low cost..    This course is an aggregate of my years of experience doing successful campaigns for my business as well as my clients.  </p>  <h4 style=\" text-align:center;\"><span style=\" color:#33cccc;\">BONUS: &quot;Facebook Quick Ads Generator&quot; <span style=\" color:#ff6600;\">Free</span></span></h4>  <h4 style=\" text-align:center;\"><strong style=\"\">After you take this course, you should be able to:</strong></h4>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Run your campaigns effectively</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Throttling down your budget multiple folds while getting the same amount of clicks or engagement you desire based on your KPIs</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Attract your best desired customers</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Generate better converging and buyers leads</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Run campaigns for customers as an advertising agency</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The course is mainly constructed of video step by step tutorials and instructions.
