    "description": "<p>  \t         It is tempting to jump in and start a blog, Facebook page or Twitter account, but your marketing will be more successful if you start with the basics. Before starting on a social media campaign, you need to know what social media actually is and how others use it on a daily basis. We will take a look how social media is used in the business world and we will go through the basics of each social media platform. We will also walk through the process of setting up accounts and basic terminology.  </p>  <p>  \t         Everyone knows they should be on social media, but most people do not have the time or the patience to maintain it. Most small business owners have great momentum when they start using social media, but it wanes as soon as more urgent issues arise. There will be tips and tricks that will help you maintain all your social profiles in just 2 hours a week. You can even do it on your couch!  </p>  <p>  \t         This course will take about 2-3 hours to complete and it will include videos, supporting documents, email support after the class is over.  </p>",
