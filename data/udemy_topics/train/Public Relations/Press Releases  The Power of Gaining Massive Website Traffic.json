    "description": "<p>  \tTraffic, traffic we all need, and want it to gain publicity and exposure for our businesses, but how do you get that much needed traffic is the question.  Naturally there are many ways to go about this, but one sure fire way that I&#039;ve tried and tested throughout my many years on the Net, is the awesome Press Release!  Many do not realize what a well-written Press Release can actually accomplish, the mind-set is that it is hard to write, and won&#039;t be very good, but they don&#039;t know about the little untold secret of how it can bring massive traffic to you and your business without even getting picked up by journalists and the like.   So please don&#039;t think that it won&#039;t help you, because it definitely can!  Follow this guide and download my PR template, a list of  80+ PR venues to submit you PR to, and grab my PR tracker to get totally organized.  Also as a huge bonus, grab the BIG Press Release Sample Book, then, watch your traffic grow!  </p>",
