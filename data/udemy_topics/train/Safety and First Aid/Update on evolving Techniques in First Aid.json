    "description": "<p>This is an update for students on the evolving and newly developing areas of treatment in first aid. Some old techniques are coming back, such as sugar and honey, and others are filtering down to lay responders such as pressure points, and still others are new in the area of sprains. This course takes you through each of these techniques and explains the new thinking that is making each gain new prominance today. These techniques are ideally suited to rural locations and remote areas of the globe, where access to medical treatment is limited. This course starts with wound treatment, proceeds to treatment of burns, use of pressure points to control bleeding and finally to new developments in sprain treatment. Key words for this course are sugar, honey, pressure points, police. This is a supplement to the course on First Aid I offer, but can be taken by any level of student. </p>",
