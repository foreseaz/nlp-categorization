Dropbox is a cloud storage system that allows you to access data over the internet instead of using your computer's hard drive. This means that you can back up your Scrivener projects inside your Dropbox account and access them from any of your other devices that have Scrivener installed even if your computer is lost or crashes.</p><p>In just 15 minutes I'm going to show you how to open a Dropbox account and get your Scrivener software to redirect your backup folders to it. Then I'm going to show you how to store your actual Scrivener projects on Dropbox so that you can switch between any of your computers that have scrivener installed whenever you want to work on your projects.</p><p>Then I am going to show you some of the useful ways you can adjust the colors of the Scrivener user interface for optimum readability as well as how to assign different label colors to your documents and have them show up in your binder, on your index cards and in your rows when you are in the list style outliner view</p>",
