    "description": "<p>Thanks to huge advances in computer technology making your own book covers is not nearly as hard as it used to be. You can use  drag and drop image building apps online. My favorite of these is Canva. </p><p>For those few things that you cannot do inside Canva, there is also no need to invest in expensive image manipulation software because you can do them in Gimp for free.</p><p>Even though designing a book cover can get a little technical, it's a skill you can easily learn. In this course I will teach you the software you need so that you too can get stuck in and create great covers for your books. </p><p>Designing images for book covers and designing them for social media banners and posts is very similar, so once you know how to use the software, you can go on to create all the marketing material to go with your book as well.</p>",
