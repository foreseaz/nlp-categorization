I had a lot to learn in order to get decent sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I had a hard time coming up with new ideas for future books.</strong> I would spend hours looking through books on Amazon trying to discover the subject for my next book. I didn't just want any idea, but one that sold.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Writing books was not easy.</strong> There was the long outline process. I would spends days and sometimes weeks planning it out. I was continually worried in case I had missed something important. The writing process was long and daunting. Hours of scratching my head wondering what to write next and how to word it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">After the hours of writing, came the editing process.</strong> This was really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all my efforts, my first books were short and lacked the quality they do today. Despite this, the content was welcomed and I received many reviews praising my ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Through experience, learning, and innovation I discovered (some by accident) many very effective methods and systems.</strong> They have allowed me to have several best-selling books.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Today, I can easily come up with endless profitable ideas for non-fiction books.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The writing process is enjoyable and a lot easier.</strong> I follow a simple step-by-step process.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">There is no long outline process.</strong> The structure takes mere minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I never wonder what to say next using my Conversation method.</strong> (I discovered this by accident.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The process includes what I call the golden nuggets.</strong> These are what turns a dry mediocre book into one of best-seller quality.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The editing is done in very easy short sessions. No long edit at the end.</strong> It consists of three steps. The second step is the breakthrough. It allows me to spot more errors than any other I have tried. The odd one still gets through. However, I know this method allows you to correct every single error. They stand out a mile.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">After trial and error, I have discovered how to make books sell themselves.</strong> I know what works and the simple methods to do it.
