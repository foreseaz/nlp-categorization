    "description": "<p>  \tDuring long commutes or workout sessions, people get tired of listening to the same old music. These people resort to finding content they are interested in and listening to it. Having your own podcast will allow you to reach this segment of people and expand your marketing presence.  </p>  <p>  \tPodcasting is relatively easy to do, but you have to know how to get started before you start uploading your audio to iTunes. Without a little bit of training, you will have some serious trouble getting started.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is designed to walk you through the steps taking your podcast from an &quot;idea&quot; to a &quot;reality&quot;. We will start with learning more about how podcasting actually works and by the end of the course, we will have your first podcast on iTunes and Stitcher radio.  </p>",
