We will also provide you with insight into how VO jobs typically run, and what the client expects of you. At the end of the video we talk about marketing and how to put yourself out there to \"get the job\". The total class length is about an hour long. No class materials are needed, but having a way to record yourself will be invaluable to review your progress.</p>",
