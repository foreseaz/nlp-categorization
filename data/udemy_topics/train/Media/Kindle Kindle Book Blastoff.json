If you don&#039;t have an infrastucture on place it can be hard to rank your books on Amazon.  </p>  <p>  \t        Learn how I do it and how you can replicate my success in this illuminating Case-Study.  </p>  <p>  \t        Even though this course is short and very low cost, it is worth gold, so make sure you watch the videos and Take Massive Action.  </p>  <p>  \t        All the Best  </p>  <p>  \t        LR Thomas  </p>",
