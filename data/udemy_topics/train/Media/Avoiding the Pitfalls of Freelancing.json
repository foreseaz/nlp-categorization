    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t       Freelancing can be a wonderful and rewarding way to make a living. And that’s whether you want to always work by yourself, or use it as a stepping stone to building a larger company. But let’s also be realistic.  Truth is, only a fraction of individuals actually make a good living at it. Sooner or later, most fail and give up.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Most fail not because they lack talent or ambition. They fail because they fall into one or more of the <em style=\"\">pitfalls of freelancing</em>—the things few of us ever consider, or that others never tell us about. So if you&#039;re thinking of freelancing, or if you&#039;re already trying to make a go of it and haven’t been as successful as you’d like, you should take this short course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       In less than an hour, this course and its supplementary materials will give you the inside scoop on freelancing for a good living. It’s about all the things no one ever shares with you. It’s about all the things that can make the difference between enjoying the fruits of working alone, or making an expensive and career-damaging mistake.  </p>",
