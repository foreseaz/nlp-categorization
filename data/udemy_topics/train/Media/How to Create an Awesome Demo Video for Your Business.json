Explainer videos are an easy and dynamic way of letting folks know about your products or services and they can mean the difference between a lookie-loo and actual sales.  </p>  <p>  \tUnfortunately, many companies let the high costs of professional videos turn them off to the real power of this marketing medium. Some folks even create low quality videos in-house.  </p>  <p>  \tAs dynamic and powerful as videos can be, bad videos can be just as persuasive... in a totally negative way - giving potential customers a bad impressive of your company. Rather than adding poor quality videos to your site, you're probably better off not adding videos at all.  </p>  <p>  \tNow your company can stand out from the crowd and you don't need to spend $10K in order to have a professional video produced for your site. Are you ready for this?
