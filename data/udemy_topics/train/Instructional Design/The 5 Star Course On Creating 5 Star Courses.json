    "description": "<p><strong>Without </strong>very good <strong>reviews </strong>and <strong>testimonials </strong>your course won't do well. </p><p>I know this is a little harsh but <strong>it's </strong>the <strong>truth</strong>. </p><p>The <strong>great</strong> news for all of us is that the <strong>magic formula</strong> is already out of the vault.</p>  <p>All <strong>we </strong>have to do is <strong>apply it </strong> to our <strong>passion</strong>. </p>  <p>In this course we will look at a very <strong>simple</strong> formula I’ve used to receive <strong>very high</strong> course <strong>ratings</strong>. </p>  <p>I’ve <strong>never</strong> paid or <strong>asked for a review</strong>… directly. </p><p><strong>Warning: </strong>If you’re caught paying for reviews on most platforms, including Udemy, they will ban you.  </p>  <p>You don’t have to, I’ll show you how to get them <strong>honestly</strong>. </p>  <p>I’ll show you how to do it <strong>ethically</strong> and <strong>indirectly</strong>. </p>  <p>All of us <strong>know</strong> that without <strong>positive</strong> reviews our course will most likely not do well. </p>  <p>In this course we do <strong>more</strong> than explore the mechanics of course creation. </p>  <p>We will cover the most <strong>overlooked</strong> and most important facet to course creation – <strong>human</strong> <strong>interaction</strong>. </p>  <p>We will cover some <strong>mechanics</strong> but any course presented well should have <strong>positive</strong> course reviews. </p>  <p>I’ll <strong>teach</strong> you how to work with students so they feel a part of the <strong>learning</strong> experience. </p>  <p>The best part about this approach is its <strong>simplicity</strong>. </p>  <p>No rocket science here. Just <strong>common</strong> sense applied to online learning. </p>  <p>Great content, presentation, audio, video and communication will provide you with everything you need to receive high course rating and positive testimonials. </p>  <p><strong>Enroll Now!</strong></p>  <p><strong>TIP</strong> – Did you notice my last statement? I didn’t write… \"please take my course.\" I didn’t write… \"my course is great.\" I gave you a firm command. <strong>Enroll Now!</strong></p><p>Also... notice that there are no words capitalized in my course descriptions above. Words that are capitalized have become synonymous with yelling. </p><p>Lastly, I used one exclamation point. If you add 2 or 3 you are yelling. I know these little tips seem insignificant but they aren't. </p><p>So, use commands at the end of your course descriptions and at the conclusions of your courses.<br></p>",
