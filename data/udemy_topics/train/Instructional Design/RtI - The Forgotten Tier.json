    "description": "<p>The great promise of RtI is the potential to reach and teach all students. That promise becomes a reality when the heart of an RtI system is a well-designed, Tier 1 program taught by well-prepared teachers who recognize the power of data to inform instruction. When all students receive good first instruction in such a system, the number of referrals for intervention goes down, proficient students maximize their learning, and gifted students grow intellectually. This course offers a step-by-step process for constructing a strong Tier 1 curriculum, identifying the essentials of data-driven instruction, and analyzing instructional strategies that lead to good first instruction for all students.</p>",
