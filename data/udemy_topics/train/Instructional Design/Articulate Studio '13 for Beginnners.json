    "description": "<p style=\"\">Hi, my name is Nate, and I&#039;ll be your trainer for this Articulate Studio &#039;13 course. Throughout this course, you&#039;ll learn to use the tools available to you in Studio &#039;13 to go beyond mundane, slide-by-slide presentations, and create engaging, user driven experiences, that will make online trainings more enjoyable for viewers, while increasing the likelihood that they&#039;ll retain what they&#039;re learning. Articulate has done a great job with this software suite. Creating interactive experiences has never before been possible without advanced coding skills and ELearning creation has never been more intuitive. Still, some instruction is required to get the most from this software suite. As a computer trainer, I&#039;ve taught this same curriculum in live classroom settings, and I always receive some positive feedback -- especially regarding my emphasis on workflow. With so many tools available to you in the Studio &#039;13 suite, it&#039;s difficult to know where to start and what to do next. I&#039;ll give you a step by step workflow of what I see as the most effective and efficient way to build a presentation from scratch. I&#039;ll show you how to download the course exercise files so you can work on presentations right alongside me. In this course you&#039;ll learn by doing, not just by watching. We&#039;ll create quizzes, interactions, screen recordings, narration, animations and much more. I look forward to instructing you on this powerful eLearning creation software and empowering you to make engaging eLearning presentations and trainings using Articulate Studio &#039;13.</p>",
