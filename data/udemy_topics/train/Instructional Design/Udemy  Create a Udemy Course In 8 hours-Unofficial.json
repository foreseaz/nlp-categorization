As Michael clearly states on the landing page, this course is not so much about how to create the elements of a course. Instead, it is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">an actual example of how an instructor puts all of the elements together to produce a finished course</strong>. Happily, I did learn some tips and tricks relating to audio and video production but the greatest take-away for me came in actually seeing a real course come together. By taking away all of the intimidating behind-the-scenes mystery, Michael helped me see just how doable online course creation can be. I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs a little inspiration to finally take the challenge and create a course.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>-----------</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Very good.
