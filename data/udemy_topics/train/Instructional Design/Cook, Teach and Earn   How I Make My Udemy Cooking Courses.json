    "description": "<p>I can cook anything I want... for free! You know why? Because I can earn by teaching what I cook. Isn't that what many of us wants to achieve - to do what we are really passionate about and at the same time earn from it?</p>\n\n<p>If this is what you're looking for to achieve, then you've come to the right place. This course is about sharing how I make my online cooking classes on Udemy which have been one of my financial sources after I've published my very first cooking class.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, I am teaching everything - from planning for the dishes that I will cook to promoting my published Udemy online cooking classes. After finishing this course, you can make your own cooking class!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I do not have a fancy kitchen. I do not have all the tools in the kitchen, all I have are the basic ones. I don't even have an oven, all I have is my passion for cooking. I'm only a home chef who loves to prepare dinner for my family and here I am now, teaching how I teach to share my ideas to others who are like me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'm glad that I found a way to monetize my everyday life and I thank Udemy for that. My life has changed ever since I published my first course.</p>",
