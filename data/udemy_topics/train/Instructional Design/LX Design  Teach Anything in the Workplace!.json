Forced to sit through training that makes us weep, snore, and contemplate tossing our laptop out of a window. Learning is an experience, and it shouldn't hurt! This course is the first in a (hopefully!) series of courses. I will walk you through the initial steps for producing a transformational, engaging, and effective course design plan. You will download templates to help you focus your thinking and ensure you have all of the information you need to support your learners in their journey. </p><p><strong><u>Who is Marcela Pineros?</u></strong></p><p>Think about a time when you've learned something new and felt exhilarated by it! I live for those A-ha! moments. After 20+ years of experience designing solutions in the learning space, I've gathered a set of tools and resources that I regularly use to make those moments happen. Having designed successful solutions for clients like NASA, Microsoft, Citigroup, Steve Madden, Perry Ellis, Nissan, Toyota, and more, I have confirmed that these strategies apply to nearly every industry and type of business.  <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Who is it for?</u></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you are completely new to training and have been asked to build a course from scratch. Maybe you have years of experience and have looked at the typical course thinking , \"There has to be a better way.\" There is. Let's get started!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>What will I do:</u></strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For your project, you will prepare a robust and effective learner needs analysis:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Briefly describe the course you are planning to teach. (150 words or less!)</li><li>Upload your completed LX Gap Analysis.</li><li>(If relevant to you) Upload your completed LX Learner Needs Analysis.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have in your hands a LX Needs Analysis that you can use as a starting point to design a series of A-ha! moments, strung together by practical tips and activities everyone will be excited to test out on the job. <strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
