    "description": "<p>Performance based equipment training (PBET) was first defined as a guideline for excellent training in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment world by SEMATECH in 1994. Subsequently it was adopted as an industry standard by SEMI in 2007. Less formally the PBET approach to equipment training has extended to the medical, robotics, and similar high tech manufacturing industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Equipment training\" is a sub category of \"technical training\" that is focused on high tech manufacturing equipment. It includes training for installation, operation, maintenance, fault diagnosis, and process-programming of complex manufacturing machines.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994 the PBET Workshop was created by Julian Serda at SEMATECH&nbsp;to enable trainers, engineers, technicians, tech writers, and others associated with equipment training to be able to:</p><p><strong>1) Recognize PBET.</strong> In other words, determine whether any training program or course embodies the PBET characteristics and PBET process.</p><p><strong>2) Develop PBET.</strong> In other words, design and develop an equipment course that embodies the PBET characteristics and PBET process.</p><p><strong>3) Deliver PBET.</strong> In other words, given an equipment course that has been designed and developed following the PBET process and having the PBET characteristics, deliver the training so that the course experience remains authentic in terms of the PBET characteristics.</p><p><strong>There are Three Lessons.</strong> &nbsp;This Udemy course, Introduction to PBET, is the equivalent of the first 3 lessons in the PBET Workshop, namely:</p><p>• Lesson 1 - Recognize the PBET Process. (approx 75 minues)</p><p>• Lesson 2 - Identify the PBET Characteristics. (approx 80 minutes)</p><p>• Lesson 3 - Interpret the PBET Steps. (approx 120 minutes)</p><p>The course includes: video presentations, review activities, downloadable Lesson Notes for each lesson, and a Certification Test.</p><p><strong>TAKE THIS COURSE IF...</strong></p><p>1) You need a solid understanding of performance-based equipment training (PBET). &nbsp;<em>This</em> course explains the expectations of having PBET-quality training at your company. You will need to <em>take the PBET Workshop</em> if you want help with implementing the PBET steps. (Learn&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.Mr-PBET.com/PBET-Workshop-Information.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">about the PBET Workshop here</a>.)</p><p><em>OR,</em> 2) The course has been assigned as pre-work for the PBET Workshop.</p>\r\n",
