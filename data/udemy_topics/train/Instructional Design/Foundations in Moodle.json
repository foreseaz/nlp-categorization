I decided that I would write and record a couple tutorials for her that would cover the basics of the program. After I finished one tutorial I would think to myself, &quot;I just </span><em style=\"\">have</em><span style=\"\"> to include one more tutorial covering another facet of the software.&quot; Needless to say, about 50 tutorials later I felt I had something that would really lay the foundation that she needed.&nbsp;</span><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">WHAT IS MOODLE?</strong></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Just in case you are wondering what Moodle is exactly... Moodle is this free, open-source, learning management system wherein educators can create online learning environments for their students. It is what high schools and colleges use to offer online classes. Educators use the program to distribute notes and resources, implement quizzes, set up forums and chats, and build an online community around their subject matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">I love that Moodle allows my students to acces my subject matter and participate in my classes from anywhere in the world... even when they are sick or on vacation! I love that&nbsp;</span><span style=\"\">Moodle does the majority of the grading for me... which means I can hang out with my wife more! I love that&nbsp;</span><span style=\"\">Moodle allows me to integrate media into my curriculum with ease; this keeps my students engaged. And I love that Moodle helps prepare my students for the acadmic environments they will undoubtedly encounter after graduation.</span></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">WHY FOUNDATIONS IN MOODLE?</strong></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Foundation is Moodle</em><span style=\"\">&nbsp;walks you step-by-step through the most important and foundational aspects of the Moodle learning management software. This course includes 60 video lectures each with written / graphic transcripts that detail each step in the process. We start at the very beginning stages of using the software, installing it on a server, and move through complete course creation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">It is comprehensive and meant for those of us who have never used the program before.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">So many educators want to incorporate technology into their instruction but don&#039;t exactly know where to start.</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">If you are looking for a place to start...</span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">...this course is for you!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"></p>  ",
