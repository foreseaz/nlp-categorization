He also focuses on strategizing ways in which learning can be simplified and made more interactive. </p>\n\n<p>He mostly trains in the UK, Europe and Asia. But he also teaches in Africa, North and South America and Australia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Călin Iepure</strong></p>\n\n<p>Next comes Călin Iepure. Călin is the Romanian governor of the Toastmasters public speaking and leadership organization. He is a public speaker and a certified master trainer, a master facilitator at Bootcamp University, a master facilitator for Speaker Elite Timișoara and a very successful business consultant.</p>\n\n<p>As a managing partner in TrainingMasters Consulting, Călin organizes events and trainings on subjects like Persuasion, Communication, Public Speaking, Leadership and Entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bogdan Vaida</strong></p>\n\n<p>And last but not least, Bogdan Vaida.</p>\n\n<p>I've been an experiential trainer for the past 7 years, creating situations and environments through which people learn by doing. I've held trainings in Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and a few other Eastern European countries. I'm a trainer for Erasmus+, Toastmasters, Alpha Personality, The European Law Students' Association and many, many other organizations.</p>\n\n<p>But this is not about my fellow colleagues or me. Călin, Roger and I are here for you! We are interested in what <strong>you</strong> need to do in order to <strong>step up </strong>your trainings. We are here to help <em>you</em> achieve <em>your goals</em>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course content</strong></p>\n\n<p>This training is not for first timers. If you've never held a training before we won't teach you how to do it so I'd advise you not to enroll in this course. It's not for you.</p>\n\n<p> What we provide for you are techniques and principles for active reviewing (also called dynamic debriefing) that you can use in <strong>any</strong> type of teaching (be it trainings, seminars, workshops, facilitation sessions, public speaking - yes, that's right- any type of teaching!) And these techniques generate long term transfer of learning.<br></p><p>A few of the techniques that you're going to learn during this training:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Back to the Future - draw from past experiences and resources to help you in your future journey.</li><li>Goal Keepers - optimize your learning through learning partners.</li><li>Storyline - reflect on your ups and downs during a challenge to help you prepare for future challenges.</li><li>Horseshoe - instant feedback on dilemmas that you or other participants may face, while seeing a topic from fresh perspectives.</li><li>.. And many more!</li></ul>\n\n<p>By using these methods you will get to know your students much better because you are giving them tools that help them reflect, express and communicate. Being more in touch with your student's needs and expectations makes it easier for you to make good judgments about how best to help them learn and achieve their goals. And you will have achieved all this by using interactive methods that most students prefer.</p>\n\n<p>Einstein once said that “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler\". When we created this course we took his wisdom into consideration and we created practical techniques that can be implemented instantly. We won't bore you with long, exhausting stories or motivational speeches. We give you the tools that help you achieve your expected results. All of this in our <strong>advanced yet </strong><strong>simple to understand train the trainer </strong>course.</p>\n\n<p>It is so much easier to say, \"I teach students\" than it is to say \"I help students learn from their experiences by providing reflective tools and facilitating the learning process.\" A loooong sentence, but much more meaningful. And this course will help you understand and act on it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Join now </strong>and learn from the experience of international trainers and facilitators!</p>",
