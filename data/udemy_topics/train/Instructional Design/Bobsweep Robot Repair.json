    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In this course, you will learn how to repair various parts of your Bobsweep. From changing a wheel to running the check-up test, we will show you how it&#039;s done so that you can have Bob back to sweeping in no time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The Bobsweep Pethair Repairs section focuses on repairs for Bobsweep Pethair that are different from the Bobsweep Standard repairs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The bObi Repairs section walks you through the same repairs for our newest product, bObi.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Repairing your intelligent floor cleaner at home is relatively easy and usually only requires the screwdriver included in the box with your Bob or bObi. New parts can be ordered from our online store or by calling our customer service center. Some replacement parts, like spare brushes may have been included with your purchase. Other parts may be discounted or covered entirely if you purchased one of our coverage plans with your Bob or bObi.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  By making at-home repairs possible, we hope to reduce your vacuum&#039;s downtime and eliminate the hassle that comes with sending products in for repair. Don&#039;t worry about packing, shipping, and waiting for your Bob or bObi to get fixed if you don&#039;t have to! All of these repairs can be completed in a matter of minutes.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Of course, if you attempt to repair your Bob or bObi, but are unsuccessful or the problem is still not resolved, your warranty is not affected. Send your bot to our repair center so that our expert team can take a look.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLet us know how the repair videos helped you, or what other topics you would like to see covered!  </p>",
