It has been proven to boost student engagement and increase content retention- ultimately leading to enhanced work performance. Incorporating gamification in your eLearning requires both the theory about how and why to use it and the practical know-how to build it.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Learn How to Deconstruct and Build Your Own eLearning Micro Game</strong></p><ul><li>PLAY the ‘Beat the Clock’ eLearning micro game</li><li>DECONSTRUCT all of the elements of the game</li><li>BUILD the game from scratch with step-by-step instructions</li><li>EXPLORE three additional games and why gamification works</li><li>ANALYZE how you can adapt and include these games in your eLearning projects</li></ul><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Master How to Develop Games for Your Own eLearning Projects</strong></p><p>Game design in Articulate Storyline uses many tools that you may already be familiar with. However, whether you’re a newbie to eLearning or an experienced pro, developing and utilizing games in your eLearning projects requires different designs and workflows than typical content. When you understand how to use these tools and combine it with the knowledge of why and when to use games and gamification within your eLearning, you’ll be able to make your projects more engaging and impactful.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>In less than an hour, you'll learn how to modify and build four eLearning micro games. First, you’ll play the game called ‘Beat the Clock’. This is a simple matching type game in which you must drag and drop icons to their corresponding text descriptions before the timer counts down to 0. </p><p>Next, you’ll download the original Storyline game file and deconstruct the game to see how all of the elements work together including layers, objects, variables, audio, and more. Then, you’ll see how to build and publish the game from scratch, with step-by-step instructions. </p><p>Once you’ve built the game, you’ll then explore three more games. Then you'll explore what gamification principles are, why they work, how they help you sustain the state of ‘Flow’, and how to design for different player types. Last, you’ll analyze and apply your learning to modify the game to your own content and design.</p>",
