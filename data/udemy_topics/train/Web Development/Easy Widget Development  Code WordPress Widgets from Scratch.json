In this course, you'll build four different WordPress widgets and learn how to use standard WordPress plugin code to create additional widgets. By the end of the course, you'll be able to implement some basic PHP code, and you'll know how to submit your very own WordPress plugin to the WordPress repository.<br><br>This course assumes that you have WordPress installed on your own domain, as we will be writing plugins that you can test right away! This is a beginner course and requires no prior programming knowledge. Students who have an interest in writing code (or at least in learning a few code snippets!) are particularly well-suited for this course.<br></p>",
