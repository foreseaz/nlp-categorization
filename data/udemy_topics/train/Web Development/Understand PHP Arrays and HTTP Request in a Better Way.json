In this course, we'll learn how to use PHP as a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">server-side scripting language</strong> for use in web development.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike traditional courses that concentrate mainly on theory, we'll take a practical “how-to” approach to working with data. Here's what you'll learn:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Associative arrays will be discussed in this course. Arrays are the key to understanding the mechanism of sending and receiving data via the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">request mechanism in PHP</strong>. We'll learn how to work with data via <strong>REQUEST, GET, and POST</strong>, and we'll also cover some important server variables exposed by PHP.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the course, and I look forward to working with you!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
