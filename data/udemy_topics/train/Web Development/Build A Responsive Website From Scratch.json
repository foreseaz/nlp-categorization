    "description": "<p>I have made this course by purely using hand made coding to make a web design layout responsive.Often people use bootstrap for this purpose but the shortcoming of the usage of bootstrap kinds of frame work is that students can not get full control over the CSS 3 properties,therefore I have made this course to make the students fully expert over all the essential HTM5.0 tags and CSS3 properties.So I am very hopeful that after joining this course and learning it, you will get a good control over making any kind of layout.This course is constituted on 35 videos and I have focused the usage of all the essential HTML5.0 tags and CSS 3 properties,so you could learn their usage very well.</p>",
