    "description": "<p>This course on 'Rapid Web Application Development with Yii 2 PHP framework' teaches you how to develop a high performing web application in a short period of time. This course is suitable for students or professionals with basic HTML and PHP knowledge. Though there are a lot of PHP frameworks in the market, Yii comes with the latest features and lessons learnt to build a modern web application in minutes. The scaffolding feature in Yii helps in generating the code, and hence the developer doesn't have to write code from scratch. This course is a short and quick course to get a glimpse of Yii framework. This course was planned to be a comprehensive one but I cut short it to see the interest of students and then make it a comprehensive one. But, this course is a short, quick and simple course for students interested in getting to know basics in a short span of time.</p>",
