Coupled with Entity Framework , you can have CRUD operations enable on your data tables in No Time . Which makes it useful for any application where data access is necessary and important.  </p>  <p>  \t      Simply put, having OData in your skill set is one of the best ways to be more competitive and more productive since it is reducing the amount of work needed to put a data service up and running for CRUD operations .  </p>  <p>  \t      This course aims to provide all the necessary foundations for anyone to get started creating and consuming data services using OData .  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">    Learn to Implement OData Producers and Consumers.</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Learn the OData Foundations  \t<ul style=\"\">  \t\t<li>Build OData Services With Diverse Data Sources</li>  \t\t<li>Understand OData Service Endpoints and Data Model</li>  \t\t<li>Learn Data Serialization With Atom and JSON</li>  \t\t<li>Lear To Consume Data Services From Mobile(Android , iOS), jquery, Angularjs, NET and PHP</li>  \t\t<li>Learn how to Secure OData Data Services Using OAuth2</li>  \t</ul>  \t</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Understand How OData Integrates The Cloud</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Broken Down, OData helps many platforms to expose some of their data from existing custom application with ease rather than creating their own mechanism to expose data. OData is by now fully integrated in some major Cloud platform like Windows Azure, Netflix and eBay .  </p>  <p>  \t      IT managers and Data professionals are turning to OData for the existing built-in support provided by the great Content Management Software like SharePoint 2010/2013 and WebNodes .  </p>  <p>  \t      This course is perfect for any data services-focused application development either web or mobile.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">    Content and Overview  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      In over 4 hours of content including lectures, this course covers necessary OData foundations and the way of implementing OData services .  </p>  <p>  \t      This course covers the solution OData provides to the need of finding a common way of accessing diverse data sources, How to build a data web services using WCF , consume data services , run queries against the data service using the OData protocol.  </p>  <p>  \t      Students will also learn some available techniques of secure REST full services and Particularly OData data services using OAuth2 .  </p>  <p>  \t      Upon completion students will be able to understand OData terminology, recognize how OData can be used to expose data from a custom application, OData services and from the cloud, be able to implement and host an OData data service on premises in IIS and in the cloud using Windows Azure, realize a real life Todo List Application and more using OData and Angularjs .  </p>",
