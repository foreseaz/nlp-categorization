BackboneJS is one of them.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                  In this course, I&#039;ll take you on a step-by-step journey to learn Backbone from novice to ninja. You&#039;ll learn everything you need to know to build structured and maintainable real-world applications with Backbone.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                  You don&#039;t need any prior knowledge of Backbone. Only basic understanding of Javascript and jQuery is enough to take this course.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \t</strong>  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">We start with the big picture </strong></h4>  <p>  \t                                                    You&#039;ll learn the basic building blocks of Backbone and what they are used for. Then, I&#039;ll show you a real-world example of an application built with Backbone and explain how those building blocks work together in action.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">Then we start learning Backbone.js from scratch</strong></h4>  <p>  \t                                                                                                  Once you get the big picture, we start learning Backbone in a practical, hands-on way from scratch. Lectures are short, concise and up to the point, without wasting your time. I hate courses that waste students&#039; time (with too much rambling) and I&#039;ve done my best to make sure I won&#039;t waste your time in this course! <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                  Each section includes:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">An introduction </strong>that tells you what you&#039;re gonna learn</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">A few lectures</strong>, each teaching you new concepts, in a step-by-step fashion</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">A cheat sheet</strong> for you to quickly review what you&#039;ve learned</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">A mini project or assignment </strong>for you to apply what you&#039;ve learned</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">Next we get into the real-world challenges </strong></h4>  <p>  \t                                                                                                  Once we cover the fundamentals of Backbone, then we&#039;ll cover unit testing and modularising the code. You&#039;ll learn the basics of RequireJS and Jasmine.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">And finally build an application from scratch</strong></h4>  <p>  \t                                                                                                  In the last section, we&#039;ll build an application with Backbone in an iterative way. With every iteration we enhance our app in a baby-step fashion.
