It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of Redux and ReactNative.</p><p>There are dozens of great tutorials online for React and Redux, but none of them teach the challenging, core features of these two fantastic libraries.  I created this course to push you beyond \"just getting started.\"</p><ul><li>Learn how to thoroughly test React and Redux code, including tests for action creators and reducers</li><li>Get familiar with Higher Order Components.  Don't know what they are?  No problem, you have been using them without even knowing it!</li><li>Rewrite a popular Redux Middleware from scratch to handle asynchronous actions</li><li>Become a master of the trickiest topic in Javascript: authentication.  You will write a server with enterprise-grade authentication from scratch that can scale to hundreds of thousands of users.  No shortcuts, no dummy data.</li></ul><p>I have built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning React and Redux.  A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.</p><p><br></p>",
