That means more jobs and more opportunities!</p>\n\n<p>I've designed this course around one goal: <strong>Turning you into a professional React developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>This course is project based. You're responsible for writing code in every video as well as completing challenges I've design to help test and reinforce what you've learned. This course is about creating, not watching!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll be programming and deploying production apps, including:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A Weather Application</li><li>A Countdown/Timer App</li><li>A Todo Application</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course doesn't just cover react. You'll learn about the rich ecosystem of 3rd party tools such as:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Atom</li><li>Webpack</li><li>The terminal</li><li>Git</li><li>Heroku</li><li>React</li><li>Redux</li><li>Chrome developer tools</li><li>React and redux developer tools</li><li>Moment</li><li>Axios</li><li>ExpectJS</li><li>Karma</li><li>Mocha</li><li>And more!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why React?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Fair question! There are so many alternatives such as Angular, Ember, Backbone, and Meteor. I use React for 4 reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>React has a small learning curve &amp; fantastic documentation</li><li>React is agile &amp; fast</li><li>React introduces a new language called JSX. It simplifies component templates.</li><li>React has an awesome community. There are a ton of great 3rd party React libraries that let you add new features in seconds.  It's also being used by companies like Netflix, AirBnb, Visa, and The New York Times in production!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I can't wait to see you inside!</p><p>- Andrew</p>",
