    "description": "<p>  \t      In this course we examine several technologies. The first is Grunt. Grunt is a task runner which is a way for us to implement a build system to handle writing our code in different languages, preprocessing, minifying our code, and doing unit testing -- all automated. We’ll also take a look at Coffeescript, which is a preprocessor for Javascript. It follows a lot of similar structures to Python and is very, very popular.  </p>  <p>  \t      Finally, we’ll discuss Sockets. Sockets are a way for us to open a constant connection between the server and the client. Normally when you make a request, the request goes up and then comes down with the data. With a socket, that request goes up and stays open, allowing the server to send data whenever it wants and the client to send data whenever it wants.  </p>  <p>  \t      So, we can make real time applications using sockets and we’ll take a look at how to implement a very simple system using socket IO.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Includes:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>16 videos with over 50 minutes of lectures and explanations.</li>  \t<li>6 external resource files.</li>  \t<li>1 exercise to help you master advanced backend web development concepts.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What You&#039;ll Learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Introduction to Grunt</li>  \t<li>Setting up Grunt with css-min</li>  \t<li>Uglify JS files</li>  \t<li>Setting up custom tasks</li>  \t<li>Watching files</li>  \t<li>Basics of CoffeeScript</li>  \t<li>If Statements</li>  \t<li>Ternary</li>  \t<li>Loops</li>  \t<li>Comments, Strings, and Interpolation</li>  \t<li>Introduction to Sockets</li>  \t<li>Scaffolding the project</li>  \t<li>Setting up Sockets</li>  \t<li>Communicating between connections</li>  \t<li>Additional Resources</li>  \t<li>Exercises</li>  \t<li>And More!</li>  </ul>",
