Gulp is a task runner that automates the boring, repetitive, and time consuming things that website developers (like you!) do dozens of times a day.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    With gulp, you can do more of the work you love (making websites) and less of the work you hate (reloading your browser, checking your code for errors, combining/minifying your files).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  When you&#039;re done this course:  </strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">You&#039;ll be able to instantly see the changes you made to your site without refreshing your browser.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">You&#039;ll become a professional developer that concatenates and minifies their JavaScript and CSS, speeding up your websites.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">You&#039;ll never have to worry about handling CSS vendor prefixes.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">You are going to understand why tooling and workflow are just as important as knowing HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">This sounds too advanced for me!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                        I promise, it&#039;s not. If you know how to create a JavaScript function, and you&#039;ve built anything using HTML/CSS or JavaScript, you know enough.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    In this course, I walk you through the basics of getting setup, step by step. I&#039;m also available on Udemy to answer any of my students questions.  </p>",
