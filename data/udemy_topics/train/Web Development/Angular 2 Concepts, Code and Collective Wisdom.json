    "description": "<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Note:</strong> All of the code used in this course (Plunkers and GitHub repos) have been updated to Angular 2 RC.3.<br><br>This course focuses on the core concepts of Angular 2.  Particular attention is given to the following areas:<br></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Change Detection</strong> - although this is at the heart of Angular 2, it is not yet widely understood. I'll explain all aspects of change detection. (Many of the questions I've answered on StackOverflow for Angular 2 are due to a lack of understanding of how change detection works.)</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Dependency Injection</strong> - see how this feature is much improved in Angular 2 over Angular 1's version.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Data Binding</strong> - I'll describe and demonstrate all of the different binding types in Angular 2, but more importantly, I'll illustrate (with detailed pictures) how the bindings actually work -- i.e., the component and DOM interactions.  I'll also examine the common sources of confusion developers have when binding using JavaScript reference types in Angular 2 apps. </li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Inter-Component Communication and Data Flow</strong> - learn how to manage data flow through your Angular 2 application, and how to insert logic hooks that trigger when data becomes available or when it changes.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you'll be sought after for your knowledge of these four areas. (And consider using your new-found knowledge to help answer Angular 2 questions on StackOverflow.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Take this course if you are a developer who wants to quickly learn Angular 2 concepts without having to read the (currently incomplete) online docs, blog posts, GitHub issues, and StackOverflow posts.  I've attempted to digest much of that Angular 2 information for you, and I've attempted to streamline this course as much as possible -- no fluff!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'll teach you how to architect an app and how to \"think in Angular 2.\" I'll discuss the real and conceptual trees that Angular 2 builds and uses to achieve very fast change detection and multi-level dependency injection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While exploring the concepts I'll iteratively develop an Angular 2 app that utilizes all of the core concepts. I'll also show you a number of separate, small Angular 2 Plunker apps that demonstrate specific framework functionality.  I'll spend time discussing some of the recurring issues that I've seen come up on StackOverflow with the angular2 tag, and I'll discuss some StackOverflow posts that reveal new techniques that you can't find in the Angular 2 documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, while you're learning Angular 2, you'll also learn some TypeScript and ES6/ES2015 features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Note</strong>: since Angular 2 is still in flux, this course is still under development.  Changes will be made, and additional lectures and quizzes will be added.  E.g., expect some lectures on the new Angular 2 router and forms (but I'm waiting for things to stabilize a bit first). <strong>Check the changelog at the end of this course periodically (at least once a week)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some student reviews:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\"This is truly a fantastic course, it is very well thought out and delivered. I have completed many courses and tutorials and there are a lot of good ones out there, but this was the first course that I felt really explained the framework, concepts and best practices. There are many things in this course that I learnt to do in other courses but never really understood why, Mark traverses that gap in a very structured and clear way... His combination of theory and explaining things with diagrams and then following up with clear coding examples really makes a difference in this course...\"</li><li>\"I really like the approach in this course. Getting to understand how things work, not just how to do things.\"</li><li>\"It cannot be better than this. When you think the author didn't talk about something you had on your mind, he would come to that at a later point.\"</li></ul>",
