    "description": "<p>Why take this course? In this course you learn how to build a professional YouTube downloader application using Visual Studio Community 2015. This application can download video files, audio files, and even files from YouTube play lists. During the process, you see how to build an interface, how to add class files, how to add external files, and how to make use of  libraries already posted on GitHub. The construction of the project is decomposed into small steps so you can build along with the course, and not feel overwhelmed. The course consists of HD videos, many of which are short, some challenges, along with the solutions, and complete visual studio files that you can download as zips or clone from GitHub. Let's get coding!</p>",
