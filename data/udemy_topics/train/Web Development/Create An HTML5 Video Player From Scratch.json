We will start from scratch (apart from some icons that I&#039;m going to give you at the beginning) and build our way to a YouTube video-player look-a-like. The videos will be in a step-by-step format, so that it will be easy to follow along. All source code will be available at our website.  </p>  <p>  \tAfterwards, you will be able to create awesome video players using the latest HTML5 video API; they will be both stunning through CSS and functional through JavaScript.  </p>",
