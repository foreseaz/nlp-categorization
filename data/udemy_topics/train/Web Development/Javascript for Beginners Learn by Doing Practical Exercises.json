By learning the bigger things in Javascript, you will be able to know how to put the remaining pieces together, and will be able to get into advanced courses more prepared.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>I'm not going to start this course with False promises.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                At the end of this course you will NOT become expert and nor will you in any other course. To become an expert in Javascript or any other programming language you need many hours of practice and experience; more like years of practice and experience.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>My PROMISE to you.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                My promise to you is that all the lessons you will see here, will get engraved in you brain better than in any other course, why? My approach is the practice approach which is the number one key into learning any programming language or technical course faster and easier.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>I created a small practice application for you inside the exercise files. </strong>At the end of every section we will jump into this small application together, and practice everything we covered in the past lectures. This approach will make sure that you can retain the information you learned longer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>      My Goal is to help you understand the major components and prepare you for advanced courses</strong>, in this way you can transition to the language easier.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          Once you know the major parts of the Javascript language, everything else will be very easy to learn, and that is exactly what this course will provide you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          With years of programming experience invested in this course, you can rest assure that the information supplied in this course will prepare you to jump into to any advance Javascript course and come out on top.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>      Commonly Asked Questions.....  </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>      Q: Is Javascript easy?  </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          A: Yes and no  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          Depends on the teacher and student. Learning Javascript is like learning a regular language, you need the major components and then you can start putting everything together. Students that jump into advanced Javascript courses might get confused and take longer to learn the language if they are not prepared with the mayor concepts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          This course's approach is to teach you the major components not just by watching but also practicing after every section, so that you get an understanding of the overall logic of the Javascript language. I find this approach to be better than jumping into an advanced course that will confuse you and leave clueless not knowing what to next, and this is why I built this crash course.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>      Q: Can I actually make money with Javascript?  </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          A: Yes and yes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          The market for Javascript is enormous and is in demand right now in any part of the world. Having a programming language like Javascript in your tool set will help you make more money regardless if you are working a regular job or freelancing. Javascript is one of the highest paying programming languages out there, and it will stay like that for a very long time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          This Javascript Course Covers the following and then some...  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<li><strong>Introduction to the language</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Understanding Javascript variables</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Understanding Javascript arrays</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Understanding Javascript functions</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Understanding Javascript Loops</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Understanding Javascript Math</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Practicing </strong><strong>Javascript variables</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Practicing Javascript Arrays</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Practicing Javascript Functions</strong></li>  \t<li><strong></strong></li>  \t<li><strong><strong>Practicing Javascript Loops</strong></strong></li>  \t<strong></strong><strong>  \t<li><strong>Practicing Javascript Math operations</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>and lots more.....</strong></li>  \t</strong>  </ul>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          And because I like what I do, I will be adding more lectures in the future. <strong>What are you waiting for?
