A lot of courses go into mundane drawn out explanations that are unnecessary and lose the student, I do the opposite, get straight to the point and show you how it works, then move on. You can revisit or rewind for refreshers and not have to worry about where in the 20 minute video that one piece of context was discussed.</li></ul>",
