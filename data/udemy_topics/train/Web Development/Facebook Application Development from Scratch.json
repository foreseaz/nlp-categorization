Around <strong style=\"\">550 million</strong> of them using apps. Is your app one of them?Not every one needs an app. Not every app needs to be social. But Facebook just provided a lot more <strong style=\"\">motivation for marketers</strong> to include a social hook in any app made for Facebook and mobile devices.  </p>  <p>  \t          Facebook and <strong style=\"\">Facebook&#039;s app ecosystem</strong> does not need any introduction.  </p>  <p>  \t          Companies and brands whose target market falls in the typical Facebook user demographic have stuck gold with well designed Facebook apps. Beyond likes and shares, <strong style=\"\">Facebook apps</strong> can help you get more engaged users, <strong style=\"\">increased traffic</strong> to your own website and spikes in revenue.  </p>  <p>  \t          But <strong style=\"\">designing </strong>Facebook apps is not the same as designing a <strong style=\"\">mobile app</strong> or a site. There are a number of factors in play here. You have to  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Be sure you are not <strong style=\"\">violating Facebook&#039;s </strong>ever changing legal and policy positions</li>  \t<li>Adopt to Facebook&#039;s unpredictable changes in <strong style=\"\">user interface</strong></li>  \t<li>Figure out a <strong style=\"\">business model</strong> that does not run afoul of Facebook&#039;s goals</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t               Facebook will soon generate a billion social actions every hour. The boost has to do with changes to <strong style=\"\">Open Graph</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t          It is time to take your idea or business to a <strong style=\"\">social networking</strong> level. <strong style=\"\">Developing</strong> a Facebook application is no <strong style=\"\">easy task</strong> and should be considered with the same depth as a new website (or more).  </p>  <strong style=\"\">Why Facebook Apps?</strong>  <p>  \t          There are many reasons why you may want to consider using <strong style=\"\">Facebook apps</strong>. They can provide communication between your customers and your customer service team, allow people to sign up for and receive your newsletter or provide your customers with <strong style=\"\">special rewards</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t          Each of these uses can help you <strong style=\"\">create a deeper relationship with your customers</strong> and foster brand loyalty. If you use a fangate to conceal the content on strategic app tabs from non-fans, you can also increase the number of likes your Page is getting.  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\"><span style=\" color:rgb(85, 85, 85);\">Keep Customers in the Know</span></strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\"><span style=\" color:rgb(85, 85, 85);\"></span>Reach Customer Support</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Make Appointments and Reservations</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Promote Special Events and Occasions</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Reward Fans</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Collect Customer Feedback</strong></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Why this course?</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Developing from Scratch (From Setting up the environment to Publishing Application)</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Straight to the module without any wasting any time.</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Source Code available for download.</strong></li>  </ul>",
