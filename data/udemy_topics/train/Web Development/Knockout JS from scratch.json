    "description": "<p>Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps creating rich and responsive display. With applications that update dynamically, Knockout will be a great fit to implement simple and maintainable binding and dependency tracking. In this course, I will explore Knockout JS in details. I will cover all the available bindings through examples. I will explore observables, observable arrays, and computed observables. I will also discuss templates and coverting data to JSON format. By the time you are done with this course, you will be eager to add Knockout to every web application you are working on.<br style=\"\"></p>",
