But often times developers get overloaded with all of these resources and don&#039;t have the time to work through them or to experiment with different ways to do things.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Time consuming setups, that don&#039;t work are a real frustration.</strong> </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">We have regular planned updates to this course to feature new techniques and technology as it becomes available.  Evolving curriculum will help students of this course stay connected to new and future technology changes.</strong></p><p style=\"\">In this course we will be reviewing many of the <strong style=\"\">popular code editors</strong>. An editor lets you write and edit various types of code. Code editors are designed to help you code better, faster and more efficiently. Picking the right editor helps you work better. We will also be going over basic setup of editors and how to customize them.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The build process</strong>, we will also be looking at your local environment and how to get the best setup to be able to test out code locally before pushing it live. Setting up a local web development environment allows you to create and modify web applications on your own computer rather than uploading the application files to a server to run the files. Additionally we will go over some great resources that will help you work more effectively.</p><p style=\"\">The last stage to the development process after writing the code and testing, will be to <strong style=\"\">transfer the files to your server</strong>. If you are working within a collaborative environment, using versioning there are some great resources to help. Transferring files to your server in addition to code management techniques will be discussed. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">step-by-step details on setting up these resources will be covered within this course.</strong></p><p style=\"\">If you are new to web development and need an overview of how it all works together, or if you are a web developer looking to increase your productivity, this course can help.</p><p style=\"\">Having a proper web development environment will help you be more productive, improve your web development workflow and avoid issues on live servers.   </p><p style=\"\">In this course we review several of the most popular web editors.   Having a good editor is essential for being able to code.   Its the foundation for your coding is your web editor and it all starts with that.  You should be able to focus on your code and not the software that you are using.  </p><p style=\"\">Once you have your editor you should be able to code and preview your code easily.  Setting up a local machine server can help you test, preview and check your code.   Use tools such as browser extensions, addons and consoles to improve your web code.   Not having to really on a live server to view your code means no internet connection required, and you can work out all the bugs before you push to your production server.</p><p style=\"\">Getting you code from your machine you work on, onto your server.   Using FTP which software is most popular, as well as using code management solutions to collaborate on coding.</p><p style=\"\">This is a course that focuses on the foundations of being more productive with web coding. Whichever coding language you use, this course is a great addition and full of excellent resources to improve your workflow.  New resources will be added regularly in addition to tips and ideas for better working environments.</p><p style=\"\">A strong foundation in web standards and website technology can help developers and designers make choices that lead to more robust, efficient, and maintainable websites.</p>",
