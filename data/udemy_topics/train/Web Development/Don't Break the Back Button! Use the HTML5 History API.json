The &quot;</span><strong style=\"\">back</strong><span>&quot;</span><strong style=\"\"> button</strong><span> is by far the </span><strong style=\"\">most used navigational element in the browser</strong><span>. It gives people browsing the web the confidence to click on links as </span><strong style=\"\">they know they can go back to where they were </strong><span>if they do something wrong</span><span>. They expect it to <strong style=\"\">always</strong> work.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t      By updating part of a web page using client-side script, <strong style=\"\">the behaviour of this button can be broken</strong>. This can frustrate and annoy visitors to your website, which <strong style=\"\">will make them leave!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      The recent introduction of the <strong style=\"\">HTML5 History API</strong> allows us to fix this - we can do partial page updates <strong style=\"\">and</strong> tell the browser that the content has changed, thereby keeping the back button in <strong style=\"\">full working order</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t      In this course you&#039;ll learn:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>How page navigation and the browser history work</li>  \t<li>How we can break the back button by doing partial page updates</li>  \t<li>How to fix it using the HTML5 History API</li>  \t<li>How to overcome inconsistencies in the API by using the <em style=\"\">History dot js</em> JavaScript library</li>  \t<li>How to provide support for the history API in older, HTML4 browsers.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t      Throughout the course we&#039;ll be building a sample website that demonstrates all the techniques discussed in the lectures. <strong style=\"\">Complete, working, fully-annotated source code</strong> is included.  </p>",
