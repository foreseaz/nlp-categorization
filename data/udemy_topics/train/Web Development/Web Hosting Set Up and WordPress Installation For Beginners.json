They don&#039;t completely understand web hosting, but they know it&#039;s something they need to have, and they ask me how to get started. How to sign up. They&#039;ve usually heard about how awesome WordPress is, but are intimidated at the thought of installing it. That&#039;s who this course is intended to help.<br style=\"\"></p>",
