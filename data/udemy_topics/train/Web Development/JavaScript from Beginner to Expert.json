Imagine a situation where the clock would need to reset each second. Your webpage would just constantly reload to update the content, destroying the user experience. <strong>With JavaScript you can update the content without reloading the webpage. </strong>What's more is that there are advanced libraries for JavaScript, like AJAX, that allow you to connect to the database and retrieve information without reloading the website. To sum up JavaScript 'runs' on the web-browser of the visitor of your website.</p><p><strong>I give you 100% satisfaction. </strong>If you do not like my course, <strong>you can request a full refund up to 30 days. </strong>Remember that if you have any questions regarding topics covered in the course <strong>please feel free to ask. </strong><em>I'm always happy to help!</em></p><ul><li><em>Over 12,000 people from around the world have enrolled in my courses</em></li><li><em>My courses are updated if needed</em></li></ul><em></em><em></em><p><strong>Please check out free lessons before buying!
