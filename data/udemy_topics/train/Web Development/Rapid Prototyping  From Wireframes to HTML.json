Build the most important elements into your project, and receive feedback early on.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we’ll evaluate the current state of prototyping tools: wireframing, Samantha Warren’s Style Tiles, Keynotopia, and what I call “sketching with code”. Wait, so you’re saying you can create prototypes right in HTML? You betcha.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second half we’ll use Twitter Bootstrap to rapidly develop our own HTML/CSS prototype. We’ll get familiar with the fundamentals, the scaffolding, and other Twitter Bootstrap elements. In addition, we’ll also incorporate a variety of external assets for images and typography that will broaden our prototyping toolkit.&nbsp;</p>&lt;/p&gt;",
