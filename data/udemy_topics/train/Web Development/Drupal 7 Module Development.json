    "description": "<p>  \t    In this course you will learn to build a Drupal custom module by  completing short tasks and ultimately weave the tasks together to get a  completed and fully functional module. Drupal 7 Module Development  introduces you to module development by understanding the essential  hooks and functions, building tables and querying the Drupal database,  exploring module security, performance and how our module interacts with  Drupal core and contributed modules. Each video walks you through  essential Drupal functions and demonstrates how to use these functions  in a module that we build hands-on together Drupal 7 Module Development  starts by showing you how to set up your local development environment  to support custom module development. You will learn how to use the best  tools and configure them. Next you will learn to configure a Feeds  importer to import content into your site that you will then leverage  with your custom module and write a menu callback using hook_menu and  hook_permissions. We will then look at the form API and write a  hook_form_alter function and create a .install file and build a db  schema function to create a table in our database Finally we create a  block using our module and theme the block. We end the course by  reviewing our module from a security and performance standpoint. From  the local development to the review of security we build a custom module  step-by-step throughout the courseâ€™s short videos.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Trevor James</strong> is a Drupal developer residing in Middletown, MD, USA.
