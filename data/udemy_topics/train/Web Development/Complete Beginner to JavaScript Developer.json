    "description": "<p>This course has been designed as a step by step guide for the complete beginner to web development that has never done it before. </p><p>In this course we will start with some of the most basic elements of what happens when you click a link in a browser. From there we will continue through HTML building the foundation that will serve us throughout our journey into JavaScript and beyond.</p><p>In CSS, we learn the importance of taking ownership of a project and the powerful feeling that comes from being able to make changes to a website based on your knowledge and taste. This is the section of the course where we redefine what a successful web development career looks like and the importance of involvement and commitment.</p><p>JavaScript is where we let our foot off the gas and turn everything up a notch. With the core skills we have learned from HTML and CSS we can start to build dynamic and interactive websites that  allow us to show more- or less of our personality or make a statement about what we do. So if you're ready to step up to the higher opportunity and better challenge, join me on this journey into JavaScript.<br></p><p>Let's get coding and have some fun!</p>",
