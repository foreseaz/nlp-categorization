So the other day someone said they wanted to see more getting started video content so I started out with this course. </p>\n\n<p>This course covers the basic GWT application development by video example. It starts out with Eclipse GWT application creating and debugging. Then moves into UI component creation, event handling and ajax calls. And finishes off with providing css styling and images for the UI. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re new to GWT, I think this would help build up quick terminology and context around building an application using GWT.</p>",
