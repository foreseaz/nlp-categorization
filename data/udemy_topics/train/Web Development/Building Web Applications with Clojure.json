You  will be presented with ways to connect to popular databases, such as  PostgreSQL or MongoDB, and learn how some existing libraries work and  how to use them properly. Thereon you will move to writing single-page  applications with ClojureScript and REST API.  </p>  <p>  \tWhen you&#039;re finished with Building Web applications with Clojure,  you&#039;ll be able to build and diagnose complex web systems in  Clojureâ€”regardless of the particular technologies applied.  </p>  <p><h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  \t<strong style=\"\">Tomek Lipski</strong> is an experienced programmer and open source enthusiast.
