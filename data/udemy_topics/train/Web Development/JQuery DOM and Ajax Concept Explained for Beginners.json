This library facilitates common JavaScript tasks for example event management, cartoons, manipulating HTML content, and communication with outside servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you'll learn</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes removing and adding whole HTML elements, in addition to changing text and other HTML attributes. We'll also learn about the best way to navigate the tree-like structure of an HTML doc using the theory of parent-child, and child-components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we will end the course by looking.
