Instead of teaching tedious theory on how to code a website, you&#039;ll learn practical knowledge on how to do it.  The best way to learn is by doing, and that&#039;s why you&#039;ll actually make a complete website from scratch.  You&#039;ll learn two different methods, by writing the code from scratch, and using Dreamweaver, a tool that every web developer should have.  You&#039;ll learn the advantages and disadvantages to using each method, and be able to see your work come to life!  </p>",
