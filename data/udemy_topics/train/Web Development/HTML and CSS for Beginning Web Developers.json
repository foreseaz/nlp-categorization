    "description": "<p>  \t HTML and CSS are like peanut butter and jelly for web designers and developers -- they go well together. Instead of learning just HTML, or just CSS, it&#039;s extremely beneficial to learn how each works together to form the basis of great, responsive websites.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">About This Course</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is focused on beginners, and will take you all the way from &#039;what does that even stand for&#039; to creating real life projects using HTML and CSS -- and understanding why and how you just did it.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">HTML5</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tHTML5 will become the new HTML standard version in the coming years, and this course was created with that in mind. Any time an HTML5 specific markup should be used, you will be taught the HTML5 version so you&#039;ll be up to date from day one.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Projects and Source Codes</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tYou will learn the basics, then create real projects that use the skills you just learned so you can understand how HTML and CSS work in the real world. You will also get access to all lesson source codes so you can deconstruct each lesson -- another valuable learning and time saving tool.  </p>",
