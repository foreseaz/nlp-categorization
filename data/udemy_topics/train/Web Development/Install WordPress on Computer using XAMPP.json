The process of installing WordPress on your personal computer is also known as setting up a local server environment or localhost.

An average user can use the local server environment to test plugins and/or make changes to the site before making it live for their audiences. In this course, I will teach you you how to install WordPress on your Windows computer using a free software called  &quot;XAMPP&quot;</p>",
