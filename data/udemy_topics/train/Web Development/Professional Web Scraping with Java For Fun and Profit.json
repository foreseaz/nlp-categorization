You learn how to classify a website in one of the two categories and then apply the right concept in order to scrape the data you want.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now you will learn how to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">export</strong> the scraped data either as <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">CSV or JSON</strong>. These are some popular formats that can be used for further processing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately many websites try to block scrapers or sometimes you just do not want to be detected. In the section <em>going undercover</em> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you will learn how to stay undetected and avoid getting blocked</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the course you can download the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">full source code</strong> of all the lectures and we discuss an <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">outlook to some advanced topics</strong> (private proxies, cloud deployment, multi threading ...). Those advanced topics are covered in a follow up course I am going to teach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you should take this course</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Stop imagining you can scrape data from websites and use the skills for your next web project, you can do it now.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Stay ahead of your competition</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Be more efficient and automate tedious, manual tasks</strong></li><li><strong>Increase your value by adding web scraping to your skill set</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enroll now!</p>",
