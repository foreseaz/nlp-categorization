In this course, we will go through some of the well supported advanced JavaScript APIs.</span>  </p>  <p>  \tAs there are so many APIs, we have selected the most popular and supported ones. We will teach every API by building a simple application using that API. All the APIs taught in this course work on mobile and desktop browsers.  </p>  <p>  \tThe APIs we cover in this course are not a part of HTML5 specification. These are APIs belonging to other specification.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><em>This course content will be updated regularly as new APIs arrive and are supported.</em></strong>  </p>",
