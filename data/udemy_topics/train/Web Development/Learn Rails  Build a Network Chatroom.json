This course will go over generating scaffolds, controllers and views as well as how to change routing. You will also learn how to find your network IP address for viewing the Rails server, as well as use bootstrap to style your application. Students will get started with Heroku, a free web hosting platform designed for Rails. You will learn how to run a rails app privately, locally and publicly. I hope to see you in this course!</p>",
