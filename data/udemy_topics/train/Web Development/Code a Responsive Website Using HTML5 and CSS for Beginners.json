    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Overview</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is the equivalent of a 3 semester-hour college course on Web Design, without all the nasty tests and final exam. This course will introduce you to the basics of HTML5 markup so you can create a website with forms, images, responsive navigation, etc. Because the course does not rely on a WYSIWYG code editor, you will also understand what each line of html markup and CSS do. This is essential so that later when you start using a WYSIWYG code editor and you need to make changes, you know what is going on under the hood.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Materials</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  In addition to the video screencasts, this course includes a start file for each unit and a completed example so you can see the code in action.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Structure</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course contains six units, each of which build on the previous unit. By the end you will have a fully functional website.  </p>",
