Python as a general purpose high level programming language is known for its simplicity. It provides constructs which allows developer to create software with fewer lines of code enabling better readability and less complexity. It also supports multiple programming styles such as functional, object oriented, procedural and imperative.</p><p>Python is a <strong>powerful, modern</strong> programming language that has the capabilities required for experienced programmers, while being easy enough for beginners to learn. Python is a <strong>well-developed, stable, and fun</strong> programming language that is suitable for complex and simple development projects. Programmers love Python because of how <strong>simple and easy</strong> it is to use.</p><p>This course has <strong>everything you need</strong> to get started with Python. We'll first start with the basics of Python - learning about strings, variables, and data types. Then, we'll move on conditionals. Once we're done with that, we'll learn about functions and files in Python.</p><p>I hope you're excited to dive into Python with this course. So what are you waiting for?<strong> </strong><strong>Let's get started!</strong></p><p>This course has been created for absolute beginners. You will start the training from the ground up and will get to know the python language and its potential in and out. We have kept the learn-ability curve pretty straight forward for this course. But this course will teach you advance python programming also. There are numerous practical coding examples to cement your concepts.</p>",
