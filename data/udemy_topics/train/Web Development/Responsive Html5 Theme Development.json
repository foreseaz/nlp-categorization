    "description": "<p>  \t       Responsive web design has gained a lot of momentum within the past 5 years. In today&#039;s market of countless mobile devices, you are one step ahead in terms of web marketting when you have a responsive mobile website. In light of that, why not take the opportunity to learn how to get started with transitioning from building old, non-responsive website to the modern  web world of fluid and engaging mobile-friendly web designs.  </p>  <p>  \t        In this course, using direct approaches, I will teach how to build such websites. This is a very focussed course and I intentionally removed unnecessary material which I believe only distracts students from what they need to know. I know this from experience, and hence the reason the course is not that long. So lean back , relax and come along this exciting journey which is responsive web design.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Please donot forget to give feedback so I can improve future courses and also I&#039;ll know how I am doing with this course. I&#039;ll appreciate it and plus it&#039;d take less than a minute, so go on click that feedback button.</strong>  </p>",
