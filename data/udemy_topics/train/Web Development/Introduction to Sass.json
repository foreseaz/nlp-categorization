    "description": "<p>Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets provide a number of tools to improve the organization, flexibility, and bloated style of your CSS.  From variables and macros to cut down your line count, to nesting and partials to help keep your concerns separated, Sass will save you (and whoever takes over your code base) time and heartache. This course will explain each of the main features of Sass, providing examples of how each one is useful and describing how to get the most out of them.  I'll also guide you through installing Sass, and then incorporating it into your website. This 90 minute course is great if you're an intermediate level web developer looking to take your styling game to the next level, and be more efficient, clean, and concise.  If you're ready to make styling fun again, check it out!<br></p>",
