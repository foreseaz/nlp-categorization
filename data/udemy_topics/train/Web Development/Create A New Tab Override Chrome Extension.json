You've landed to the right course. Inside this course, I'll show and guide you how to create a new tab override Chrome extension that will load a random image every time you open a new tab in your Chrome browser.</p><p>We're also going to fetch a quote from a quote API server and put it at the middle of the new tab image.</p><p>You <strong>don't need</strong> to know advanced programming languages like <strong>PHP, Ruby or Java</strong> to built that. If you already know <strong>HTML, CSS, JS</strong> and some jQuery, it's more than enough for you.</p><p>If you don't know jQuery, that's okay. We just small amount of jQuery inside this course and I'm going to explain what I'm actually doing inside the code.<br></p><p>See you inside the course!</p>",
