    "description": "<p>In this course you will learn how to create a website with Jekyll, a very awesome static website generator.</p><p>With Jekyll you can build a blog, a portfolio, or any website, without having to depend on a database or content management system. That's because Jekyll doesn't require setting up a complex application on a web server like WordPress, Ruby on Rails, or Flask. With Jekyll you can host your site for free on GitHub pages.</p><p>In this course, we'll start by walking through how Jekyll works, installing Jekyll and then we'll build a fully functioning site with content. You'll learn how to build templates and individual pages by using the Liquid template language, Markdown, and YAML front matter, which Jekyll then processes to generate the finished site. </p><p>At the end, you'll learn how to deploy a Jekyll site to Github Pages where it can be hosted for free.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
