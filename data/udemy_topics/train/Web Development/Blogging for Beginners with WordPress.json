You don&#039;t need to be a programmer, be technical or be good with math. You do need to be able to follow a set of instructions and you need to be able to get to the web... looks like you have that working.</p><p>Set aside and afternoon, and follow along while you actually setup your website. Whether you use a blog to change your life and get invited to the White House (I did) or just use it to collect your thoughts, you can start today.</p>",
