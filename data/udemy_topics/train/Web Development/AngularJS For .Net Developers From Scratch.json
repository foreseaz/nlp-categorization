But the problem comes when you want to mix these two technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Yes! We need a course that teaches AngularJS for those developers who have been working on Asp.Net technologies (MVC or WebAPIs) and want to upgrade their profile with new client side web development javascript framework i.e., AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>this course is for an Asp.Net web developer</strong> and it is straight to the point with less theory and more real-time implementation scenarios.</p><p><strong></strong></p>",
