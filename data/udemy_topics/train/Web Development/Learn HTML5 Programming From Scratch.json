You will learn how to create HTML websites and use CSS in your work before we start discussing HTML5. We do not assume any prior knowledge so we go through the concepts from the beginner's point of view. In our HTML5 lectures we start with new tags and forms. We then gradually move to advance topics like Drag and Drop and Multimedia. We follow it with difficult topics like Geolocation, WebStorage and Application cache. This course creates easy to grasp examples for each of the concepts and by the end of it you will be able to understand the complete picture rather than just bits and pieces of the technology.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             This is the complete HTML5 course you will need to get you started with HTML5 application development.</p>",
