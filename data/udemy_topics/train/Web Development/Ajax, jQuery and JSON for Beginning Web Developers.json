Learn what these these technologies are, how they work together, and how to build real life applications using them.  </p>  <p>  \tThis easy to follow course teaches beginning web developers what you need to know to begin using Ajax, jQuery and JSON in the real world. Our approach is to teach them all in one course so you can understand the entire process of developing with these technologies instead of learning one, then struggling to understand how it works with other technologies to produce something useful.  </p>",
