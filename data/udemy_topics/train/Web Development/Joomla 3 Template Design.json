You can buy templates, or even download and use free ones. However, if you really want a unique look, you need to create your own template.  </p>  <p>  \t This class is split into two parts. In the first part, we have over 20 videos that introduce you to Bootstrap. In the second part, we show you to apply your Bootstrap design to Joomla, using advanced features such as LESS and media queries.  </p>",
