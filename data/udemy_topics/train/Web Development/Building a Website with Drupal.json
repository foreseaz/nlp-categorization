    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   Building a Website with Drupal is aimed at those with web designer skills wishing to learn how to use Drupal to build sites. Beginning with a tour of the Drupal site, the attention shifts to establishing a web test server that is setup to house the prototype. Various customization topics are covered for content types, menus, and views. Building a custom theme without writing any PHP is covered next. The final steps of this course include prep work for migration to an actual web server.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Surmount the initial learning curve associated with building sites using Drupal by studying how a community site is put together.  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Irene Kraus</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  One facet of Ms. Krausâ€™s work is as an independent Drupal website builder and designer.
