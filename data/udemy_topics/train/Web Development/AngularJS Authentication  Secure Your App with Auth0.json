    "description": "<p>Authentication for traditional web applications is fairly straight-forward: we send our credentials to the server, a session is created, and a cookie is returned to be saved in the browser. This method works well for round-trip applications, but it isn't a good way to do authentication in modern single page apps, like those built with AngularJS.</p><p>In this course we are going to learn about the challenges associated with traditional authentication and how to use what is arguably the best alternative: the JSON Web Token.</p><p>Using that knowledge, we'll implement authentication in an AngularJS app that makes calls to an Express API. We'll cover how to address all the challenges associated with keeping a single page application in check when it comes to stateless authentication. This can be a tricky matter since the front end and backend apps are effectively separated, but we'll find out how to leverage our user's JWT to address the challenges.<br></p><p>We'll use Auth0 as an identity and authentication server so that we don't have to roll our own.</p>",
