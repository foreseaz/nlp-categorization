    "description": "<p>Fast Joomla websites, that is what this course is about. I will talk about optimizing the Joomla core settings, but also how third-party plugins and services can help you make your site even faster. As long as you know the basics of Joomla administration you should be able to follow this course. </p><p>The course takes 4 hours, with mainly video and some slide-presentations and is easy to follow for intermediate Joomla enthousiasts.</p><p>I will first explain why it is so important to have a fast website and also talk about your hosting environment before we jump into Joomla. Then we will optimize Joomla, using the caching and zipping-features inside the CMS. After having optimized Joomla and your hosting parameters we will discuss a number of plugins that make Joomla even faster. These plugins are about stuff like optimizing CSS and Javascript, using Content Delivery Networks, etcetera.</p><p>We will also discuss optimizing images, often the biggest resource part of a website. Finally, we  will discuss optimizing for mobile devices.</p><p><span></span>In the end, you will no longer have a slow website, it will probably be more then twice as fast as it was!</p>",
