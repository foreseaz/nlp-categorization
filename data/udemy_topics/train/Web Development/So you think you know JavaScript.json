From beginner to intermediate - this course will bring you up to speed on some of the must have knowledge of being able to write in it effectively, while demystifying some its most often-misunderstood constructs!</p><p>In this course, you will learn all about <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">scopes</strong>, “<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">this</strong>”, and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">prototypes</strong>! Training content often doesn’t dive into the specifics of the nature of these “advanced” features. However, it is my belief that this is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">necessary </strong>knowledge to be an effective JavaScript programmer!<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My goal at the end of this course is that variable scoping, the usage of the “this” keyword, and the creation and use of prototypes is well understood from a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">ground up</strong> perspective without compromise. Simply by having a firm grasp on these aspects of the language, many issues that even years-long JavaScript developers face can be resolved easily!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will discuss, in depth:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><p>Scopes and Closures</p></li><li><p>Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)</p></li><li><p>Hoisting</p></li><li><p>The “this” keyword</p></li><li><p>The call/apply/bind functions</p></li><li><p>The nature of the magical “new” keyword</p></li><li><p>Object and function prototypes</p></li><li><strong>And more!</strong></li></ul>",
