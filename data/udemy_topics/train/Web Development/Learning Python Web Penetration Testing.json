    "description": "<p>With the huge growth in the number of web applications in the recent \ntimes, there has also been an upsurge in the need to make these \napplications secure. Web penetration testing is the use of tools and \ncode to attack a website or web app in order to assess its \nvulnerabilities to external threats. While there are an increasing \nnumber of sophisticated ready-made tools to scan systems for \nvulnerabilities, the use of Python allows testers to write \nsystem-specific scripts, or alter and extend existing testing tools to \nfind, exploit, and record as many security weaknesses as possible.</p>\n\n<p>This course will walk you through the web application penetration \ntesting methodology, showing you how to write your own tools with Python\n for every main activity in the process. It will show you how to test \nfor security vulnerabilities in web applications just like security \nprofessionals and hackers do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course starts off by providing an overview of the web application\n penetration testing process and the tools used by professionals to \nperform these tests. Then we provide an introduction to HTTP and how to \ninteract with web applications using Python and the Requests library. \nThen will follow the web application penetration testing methodology and\n cover each section with a supporting Python example. To finish off, we \ntest these tools against a vulnerable web application created \nspecifically for this course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop just running automated tools—write your own and modify existing \nones to cover your needs! This course will give you a flying start as a \nsecurity professional by giving you the necessary skills to write custom\n tools for different scenarios and modify existing Python tools to suit \nyour application’s needs.</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About The Author</strong></p><p><strong>Christian Martorella </strong>has been working in the field of \nInformation Security for the last 16 years, and is currently working as \nPrincipal Program Manager in the Skype Product Security team at \nMicrosoft.
