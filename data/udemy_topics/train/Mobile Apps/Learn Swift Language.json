A new language that lets everyone build amazing apps. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        Swift is a powerful and intuitive new programming language created by Apple for building iOS and Mac apps. It’s designed to give advanced developers the freedom and capabilities they need to create a new generation of cutting-edge apps. It also opens up a whole new world of possibilities for everyone else. Swift is easy to learn and use — even if you’ve never coded before. So now anyone with an idea can create something incredible.  </p>  <h4>Better performance equals better apps.</h4>  <p>  \t        Swift apps more than live up to the name. For instance, a common search algorithm completes much faster using Swift.  </p>  <p>  \t        up to 2.6x faster than objective-C  </p>  <p>  \t        up to 8.4x fatser than Python 2.7  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What&#039;s the course about and how is it structured?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      In this course we will learn Swift with a step by step approach using Xcode 6.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The course covers :</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Variable types  </p>  <p>  \t      Variable type conversions  </p>  <p>  \tStatements  </p>  <p>  \t    Strings  </p>  <p>  \t    Arrays  </p>  <p>  \t    Dictionaries  </p>  <p>  \tFunctions  </p>  <p>  \tClasses  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Materials</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The course consists of :</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    1- hour video lectures with code from scratch  </p>  <p>  \t    This course can be completed in a couple of hours.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Why to follow this course?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    If you want to learn Apple&#039;s new powerful programming language this course is for you!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Who can follow this course ?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    Anyone with basic knowledge of programming can follow this course.  </p>  <p>  \t    Copyright © Valsamis Elmaliotis 2015  </p>",
