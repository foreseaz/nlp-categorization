Based on the feedback we would be evolving the course to cover a lot more topics which would start diving deep into Android internals and design.</p><p>The price for the course is only for covering the costs of making the video and time we have dedicated to this project.</p><p>If you have any suggested topics then please send us a message in udemy or update in the comments section of the course.</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Riaz &amp; Naseer</p>",
