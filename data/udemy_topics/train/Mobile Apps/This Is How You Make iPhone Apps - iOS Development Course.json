No  problem.  We&#039;ll create our first app in  Lesson 2 without writing a single line of code.   Then in Lesson 3 <strong style=\"\">of this iOS app  development tutorial,</strong> we&#039;ll learn how to write code in Apple&#039;s Objective-C  programming language.  </p>  <p>Once we&#039;ve gotten the hang of programming, we&#039;ll create three more apps  as we explore Apple&#039;s iOS software development kit.  I&#039;ll walk you through every detail of  developing the apps from project creation, through every line of code, and on  to testing the app.  </p>  <p>Finally, in the last lesson I&#039;ll let you watch over my shoulder as I  submit an app to The App Store.  </p>  <p><strong style=\"\">Take the course now, learn iOS  development now and have your first fully functional iPhone app before the end  of the day.</strong></p>",
