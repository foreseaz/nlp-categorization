Over the years, I have noticed an apparent problem with programming tutorials. No one explains to you the process of building an application from beginning to end.&nbsp;</p>  <p>How can we solve this problem? The answer is simple, lets build an entire application from scratch!</p>  <p>This course is designed to show all the steps taken to build a fully functional application from the creation of the project to the final steps before submission. For this course, it is best to have a basic understanding of iOS development and xCode.</p>  <p>Hope you enjoy the course!&nbsp;</p>  <p></p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
