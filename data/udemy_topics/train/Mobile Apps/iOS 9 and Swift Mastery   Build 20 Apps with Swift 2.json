    "description": "<p>  \t  This course aims to show you that building IOS Apps with swift is fun and relatively easy. Learn how to create 20 apps using apples new language Swift. Each app will be a bit more complex, but we build it together, so theres no guesswork as to the process and what the code is doing. A lot of work goes into my courses to make the code as easy to understand as possible..i use callout graphics, highlighting, and deep explanations to help guide you along the path of the code, each step of the way. </p>\n\n<p>Some of what you will be leaning:</p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Featuring apps built by the award winning programmer Paul Hudson</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Swift language - we go from variables to creating our own functions and  more</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn Swift by use of diagrams / highlighting / graphics </strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learning the ins and outs of Xcode 7 and its many attributes</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Working in storyboards and all it nuances  </strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use with controls / Outlets and Actions </strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use logic for smooth control flow</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using segues and passing data, in storyboards, and programmatically</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using delegates and protocols</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Adding audio  / Animations</strong></li><li><strong>Master strings in Swift</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Working with the NSTimer class</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using stackView</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The new safari view controller class</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using core image</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using core data</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Implement a slide-out controller to use as a settings page or other data</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn the best Debugging Techniques</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using core spotlight</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">iAds - Learn how to add advertising to your apps</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Working with the many swift classes available to us</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">More than 30 hours of video describing the details of building iOS apps</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Creating an iCloud app</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Using Push Notifications in an app</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">SpriteKit / Build a Flappy Bird Clone in under 1 hour</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn sketch 3 (fast becoming the industry standard for UI design)</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Autolayout easy and advanced - create constraints using VFL</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn how to work with JSON data in swift</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">All videos are recorded in HD for maximum resolution and clarity</strong></li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Swift is the new language of the future, And with this course you will get plenty of instruction on how to implement Swift code in unique ways, in an easy to understand  step by step format. Everything is explained in detail using graphics, animations, and annotations, so there's no guesswork as to how or why the code works the way it does, it just all makes sense, and is easy to implement, and before you know it you will have built yourself a wonderful working app that you can submit to the app store.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course assumes you have no programming experience, so its perfect for the beginner. Its also a nice fit for the intermediate and experienced coder as the course covers advanced techniques as well...like creating autolayout constraints in code using VFL.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> By adding your own creativity and data, you will be transformed into an Apple Developer in a very short time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Happy Coding :-)</p>",
