I will take you through the Ostetso framework which is a free photo sharing network. Leverage the power of Instagram in less than an hour! I will show you how to:</p><ul><li>Install Xcode (and iOS simulator)</li><li>Install Ostetso</li><li>Import your photos into the app</li><li>Create a simple sharing function</li></ul><p><br></p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>This course is designed to get you up and running with Xcode and iOS in <strong><em>record</em></strong> time.
