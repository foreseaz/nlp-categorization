    "description": "<p>The Basics of Xcode 7 Auto Layout and Constraints.  Hope you find these lessons helpful.  There is noting as frustrating as having a wonderful App, working fantastic with code but with bad Layouts and Conflicting Constraints.</p><p>Coding is one part of the App development and then there is the graphics and layout needs.  Constraints and Layout gets talked about like a stepchild and it takes so much time to read about it that I decided to make a quick tutorial and hope you like it.</p><p>I will be working on a more detailed Layout and Constraint Lecture if requested.  Any and all kinds of feedback will be taken to hart and I will work on improving my style and my information to better serve the students.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Elizabeth</p>",
