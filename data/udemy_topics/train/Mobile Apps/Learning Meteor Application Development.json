By taking advantage of all of Meteor&#039;s efficient development capabilities, you can take your development skills to the next level, and build those â€œkiller apps&quot; you&#039;ve been dreaming about.</p><p style=\"\">We&#039;ll begin by installing Meteor, configuring the development environment and building a baseline application, allowing us to quickly and easily create a fully functional application.</p><p style=\"\">Then we&#039;ll create a full-stack application, and build a simple, elegant, data-reactive UI. We will connect that UI to back-end services by creating a MongoDB data collection, Meteor DDP services, and a RESTful API. As we come to the end we will test our application and deploy it to Meteor&#039;s servers or to a customized production environment, so that we can show it off to the world!</p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\"></span><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong><strong style=\"\">Isaac Strack</strong> is a design technologist and STEM education advocate, currently working as a Solutions Consultant for Adobe Systems.
