    "description": "<p>From your first empty activity, going through code smells, good practices, design patterns and refactoring, finishing with a CRUD application that uses a local database to store its information.</p><p>In this course we will go through all the steps required for you to start your own first application. But we will not do bad code to do that... we are professionals and care about our code since it is our product. Let's question together the practices and code that we generate throughout our application, trying to improve it step by step.</p><p>You can expect to see a lot of API, from RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, ScrollableView, Text and Rating views, Buttons, custom shapes, Intents, extra serializable information, SQLite, SQL, DAO, ArrayAdapter, dynamic ListViews, action menus, context menus and more.</p><p>You can also expect the same high quality teaching method that I apply in each and everyone of my 50+ courses at Alura and my other courses here at Udemy (check my ratings and students feedback).</p><p>This is not a course for those who want an easy and unmaintainable solution, this is a course for better developing our apps. Welcome to a better software development world!</p>",
