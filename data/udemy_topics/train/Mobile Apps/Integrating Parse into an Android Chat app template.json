It&#039;s not a &#039;start-from-scratch&#039; course, it is for people who have an app template already (we provide a free one!) and who would like to add a simple backend API to it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   In the course we&#039;ll be setting up a free Parse account, creating the backend classes for our Chat app in Parse, and then integrating the Parse API into our Android Eclipse app template.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   It&#039;s 7 short lessons, and at the end you should have a simple Android Chat app up and running.  </p>",
