The main character Michael knight used to communicate with his intelligent car named KITT using his watch. Now don’t look any further.

You will learn how to design the user interface using Xcode, then program the code logic using Swift. These lectures teach you the ways to create communication between the Apple watch and the iPhone. Learn these priceless skills while building your amazing app.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tImportant: This is not a beginner level course, this is for people that already took my course on &quot;Complete Apple Watch dev course by building apps&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course is a must take for anyone that plans on doing in-out communication between the Apple Watch and the iPhone  </p>",
