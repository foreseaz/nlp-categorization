    "description": "<p>In software development, PhoneGap is a mobile development framework created by Nitobi. It enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in iOS, Windows Phone, or Android. It enables wrapping up of HTML, CSS and Javascript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and Javascript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application nor purely web-based.</p><p>The core of PhoneGap applications use HTML5 and CSS3 for their rendering, and JavaScript for their logic.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Prerequisit</strong></p><p>HTML : The student must know how to use HTML tags and attributes. Only a very basic understanding of HTML is assumed.</p><p>Programming: If you have some basic programming knowledge then it will be helpful. Knowledge of programming such as in Xcode, Core Java etc.</p><p>Notepad++ (Recommended): Notepad++ is a free, open-source text editor. Although JavaScript and HTML can be written using any text editor, Notepad++ is highly recommended because of features such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete.</p><p><strong style=\"\">What You will Learn in this Course</strong></p> <ul style=\"\"><li>-Using PhoneGap to build an Application</li> <li>-Understand the Basic concepts of PhoneGap Application</li></ul> <p><strong style=\"\">Course Outline</strong></p> <ul style=\"\"><li><strong style=\"\">Setting Up the Development Environment</strong></li> <li>Course Introduction</li> <li>Install Native Tool sets</li> <li>Install Phonegap/Cordova</li> <li><strong style=\"\">Build Your First Application</strong></li> <li>Hello world app for iOS and Android</li> <li>Simulator Testing</li> <li><strong style=\"\">And Basic HTML5</strong></li> <li>Elements</li> <li>Tags</li> <li>Attributes</li></ul>Come Join Us",
