    "description": "<p>  \t Justin Dike, lead developer and owner of <a href=\"http://www.CartoonSmart.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">CartoonSmart.com</a> teaches this course in Actionscript 3 development for mobile platforms. As of Flash CS5.5, Adobe has given developers the option to quickly export their Actionscript 3 projects for iOS or Android. As most developers now know, the Flash Player platform isn&#039;t doing so well on mobile platforms, but Adobe Flash as a development tool is ironically thriving with its easy export options and hundreds of thousands of experienced Actionscript programmers. This is an exciting time to be learning Flash and AS3 for mobile development, and specifically game programming.  </p>  <p>  \t These tutorials were recorded using Flash CS5 but the Actionscript 3 demonstrated is the same as it was a couple versions ago.  </p>",
