Now you can for free.  </p>  <p>  \t     Iâ€™m Gareth Ffoulkes from One Dreamer and my goal is to help aspiring and indie developers enter and thrive in the mobile app industry.  </p>  <p>  \t     With this course, you get the full source code of &#039;Cute Rush&#039; an addictive and successful game in the App store. Cute Rush includes many important features such as Game Center, Facebook/Twitter integration and In-app ratings. You also get the One Dreamer Editor to help you on your app development journey.  </p>  <p>  \t     In this course I walk you through the process of setting up your developer account, reskinning the source code and launching your app to the Appstore. Not a single line of code is required.  </p>  <p>  \t     You have full access to the well-documented source code and a free license to submit to the App store. Any revenue you make off your app is completely yours. Any modification or customisation is entirely up to you.  </p>  <p>  \t     This is a perfect way to start your mobile development career and this is a must have for anyone wanting to add another successful app to their portfolio.  </p>  <p>  \t     I hope you enjoy the course. Keep dreaming apps.  </p>",
