Hurray!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><br>  \t</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>I&#039;ll be sweet and short.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        &quot;Lazy&quot; here means <strong>&quot;simple and straight to the point&quot;</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t            All of us heard about the FREE2PLAY model. You give your app for free, than you put some ads in or offer In-App Purchases. You may offer In-App Purchases for removing the ads or for buying coins, new levels, upgrades etc.  </p>  <p>  \t            The problem is that adding In-App Purchases to your app or game can be a lot of hard work. It can be confusing and frustrating. You could spend days or even weeks figuring out how it works and how it all comes together.  </p>  <p>  \t            Here&#039;s where this course can help you.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong> In under less than an hour you will learn to add In-App Purchases to your apps.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            We will be using RMStore, a lightweight iOS library. RMStore adds blocks<a href=\"https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#storekit-with-blocks\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> and notifications<a href=\"https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#notifications\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> to StoreKit, plus receipt verification<a href=\"https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#receipt-verification\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> and transaction persistence<a href=\"https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore/blob/master/README.md#transaction-persistence\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>. All in one class without external dependencies. Also, it is well maintained and supports iOS7. Now, that&#039;s music to my ears :)  </p>  <p>  \t <strong> Stop spending your time on unmaintained libraries or hundreds of dollars on outsourcing.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            You have to do three things:  </p>  <ol>  \t<li>Take this course</li>  \t<li>Add In-App Purchases to your apps</li>  \t<li>Profit!</li>  </ol>  <p>  \t    Note: RMStore supports consumables and non-consumables. It needs a little adjusting to support auto-renewable subscriptions (not covered in this course). If you are interested in adding auto-renewable subscriptions to your app stay tuned, a new course on the topic is on its way.  </p>",
