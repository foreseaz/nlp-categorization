    "description": "<p>This easy 35-minute course will take you through 10 of the best online app creation solutions for business that do not require coding language. Starting with some of the simplest online app creation solutions, we will look at what we believe to be the best 10 solutions to either creating your online mobile-friendly website or native app, or both using one of these online platforms. We also explain the special agreement that is required with Apple in order to submit apps to their market, and show you how you can also turn app development into a lucrative sideline using either revenue sharing, in-app purchase setup, or reselling apps. We have included the entire Powerpoint after Lecture 5 (as a PDF file), so that you can click on the links and go straight to the sites to check them out after you are done with the course, to keep as a reference. We have no affiliate relationship with any of these sites or solutions. We just did this research for an ebook on content marketing on for this course, so that you could have a mobile-friendly website or app without having to do ANY CODING. If you want to be compliant with the April 15, 2015 Google algorithm updates, here's the easiest way to do it!</p>",
