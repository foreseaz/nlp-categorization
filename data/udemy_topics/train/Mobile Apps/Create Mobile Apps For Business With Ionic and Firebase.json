    "description": "<p>Hi,Thanks for checking for my course.</p><p> We are looking at what is important to configure Ionic Framework on your Windows, Linux or Mac and develop visually great applications with minimal amounts of code and design skills necessary.<br></p><p>Ionic is a powerful framework that helps you build <strong>native look and feel </strong>iOS and Android apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's based on two-way data binding and AngularJS for powerful templating.<br></p><p>We will be using Firebase as our backend for our application and the positive side of that is that we are able to upload and save data in our application.The back-end Firebase is a perfect complement to Ionic.<span>Unlike other services where you have to constantly keep refreshing and loading the data. Firebase helps you build a very efficient network with seamless networking integration.</span><br></p><p><span>With Ionic the dream of using web technology to build mobile apps is finally here. It won't a second-class option, it's the future of mobile app development.<span><br></span></span></p><p>Let's get started!</p>",
