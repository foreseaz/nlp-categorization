This is a super easy reskin of an iOS app source code that can make you money fast!  </p>  <p>  \t       You will see <em style=\"\">every single edit</em> necessary to launch an app, and in <strong style=\"\">less than 2 hours</strong>. This includes the very first steps you take after you get your hands on a source code (learning how to test the app) to editing the app in Xcode, and all the way to submitting the app to the App Store for review. The tutorial uses a <em style=\"\">REAL</em> source code example and completes every single step necessary to reskin the app from start to finish, and is structured in that way. While this uses a specific code (that you can purchase), the course is still very useful for reskinning any app. It will give you the knowledge necessary to understand documents that come with source codes that you can purchase at very low prices.  </p>  <p>  \t       This is perfect for any beginner that is interested in entering the world of app development, but <em style=\"\">does not want to spend a ton of money or time</em> creating an app from scratch and hiring developers. Instead,  you can focus on <strong style=\"\">monetization</strong> through in-app purchases and ad networks, which, by the way, is part of this course. You can <em style=\"\">literally reskin one source code 100 times </em>using this tutorial to generate large profits incredibly quickly.  </p>  <p>  \t <a href=\"http://moneyfromapps.com/random-text-generator-source-code/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Check out the source code</a> we use in this course.  </p>",
