The course goes from the basics of downloading the needed software, to building an app, and finishing with putting that app on your own iPhone.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Create, Design, Build, and Export an iPhone App</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Put an app on your iPhone</li><li>This course can be completed in a short period of time</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Build an app and put it on your iPhone in one evening.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course you will use how to use a Mac computer (useful if you come from a Windows background), how to download the necessary software, and have an introduction into how to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will then build your first app and run it on a simulator. Once you have achieved that we move onto building a fully functional app, and by the end of the course this app will run on your own iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To keep things moving fast and fun this course is only 14Â lectures in length and comprises a mixture of talking head videos, screen videos, articles, and quizzes. It is a really engaging course that will keep you interested and alert from start to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>The holy grail of this course</em></strong> is that by its completion (usually can be done in one evening) you will end up with a fully functioning app on your iPhone which you can proudly show off to your friends and family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what are you waiting for.....go and purchase it today!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
