    "description": "Building an app is an exciting process, but connecting your app to the web opens up a world of possibilities and gives your users access to the content of their choice while keeping them in your app. This provides a clean and enjoyable user experience, which is what software should really be all about in the first place.  <p>  \t                                  In this course, you can not only expect to learn how to use Swift and Xcode 6 to build an application, but also how to leverage web services like JSON so your users can perform in-app searches for real IMDb content.  </p>  <p>  \t                  Using Swift to Build an IMDb Search App should only take a few hours of your time, but will establish best practices that will make app development in Swift not only easier, but more enjoyable for you - and your users.  </p>  <p>  \t                  If you&#039;re tired of taking the same old &quot;To-Do List App&quot; tutorial and want to learn how to open your application up to the web, then this is the course for you. We&#039;ll walk through each step of the process together and I will be available through the Udemy forums for any support you may require or questions you may have along the way.  </p>  <p>  \t                  Hope to see you inside!  </p>",
