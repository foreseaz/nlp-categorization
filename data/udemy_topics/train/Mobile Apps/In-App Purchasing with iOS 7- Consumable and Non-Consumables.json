You&#039;re welcome to skip ahead to the Quick Start guide (and copy our InAppManager and InAppObserver classes). You can begin testing purchases or creating an in-game money system within an hour. <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t   Included with the tutorial movies are two source projects, one uses the Sprite Kit template and another uses the starting template for Single View Application. These projects alone make for a valuable reference, but you&#039;ll get three hours of tutorials explaining every detail! The source projects have been added to the final movie in the <strong style=\"\">Supplemental</strong> <strong style=\"\">Materials</strong> tab.  </p>",
