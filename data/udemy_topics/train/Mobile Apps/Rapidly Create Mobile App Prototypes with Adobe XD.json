    "description": "<p>Before spending your time and effort to code a mobile app, it's a good idea to create a prototype.\nYou might even be required to create one by a client or boss. That's a good\nthing, because a prototype serves as a blueprint, so you can see in advance\nwhat you're creating. Not only does Adobe XD makes this process fast and\nvisual, you don't have to do any coding. It's better than making static screen\nmock-ups in other programs like Illustrator and Photoshop because you can create\nsimple interactions and links, view the results on your mobile device, and\neasily share the results with other people. You can see what you're getting\nbefore you start the actual development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are involved\nin any way with designing or developing apps or websites, this course is for\nyou.</p><p>This version of Adobe XD runs only on the Macintosh. Adobe has said they will release a Windows version towards the end of 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Contents\nand Overview<br></strong>This is a\nproject-based course: we go through all the steps of creating a prototype from\nstart to finish, using all the tools and features currently available in Adobe\nXD.
