This allows you to access low-level hardware features and create robust experiences in a familiar Android environment.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\">The Glass Development Kit</h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The Glass Development Kit (GDK) is an add-on to the Android SDK that lets you build Glassware that runs directly on Glass. Use the GDK to take advantage of the following features:  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Real-time User Interaction</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Offline Functionality</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Access to Hardware</li>  </ol>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Google designed the Glass platform to make the existing Android SDK <em style=\"\">just work</em> on Glass. This lets you code in a familiar environment, but for a uniquely novel device.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\">The Mirror API</h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This RESTful API lets you build Glassware by letting you use the language of your choice and providing web-based APIs. You may want to use the Mirror API if you need:  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Platform independence</li>  \t<li style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t    Common infrastructure  \t</p>  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t    Built-in functionality  \t</p>  \t</li>  </ol>  <h4 style=\"\">Hybrid Glassware</h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Mirror API Glassware can invoke GDK Glassware through a menu item. You can use this hybrid model to leverage existing web properties that can launch fuller experiences that run directly on Glass.  </p>",
