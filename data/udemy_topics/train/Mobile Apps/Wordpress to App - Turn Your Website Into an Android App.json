    "description": "<p style=\"\">** The course was last updated on August 2015.</p><p style=\"\">** Adsense users - please watch the free preview lecture - &quot;IMPORTANT information about monetizing a mobile app!&quot;</p><p style=\"\">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p style=\"\">  \t  This flash course will take you through the short and easy process of turning your Wordpress (or non-Wordpress) website into a downloadable Android app.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What is a WebView app?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  A WebView app is a native app which anyone can download from the app stores and install on their devices. The term &quot;WebView&quot; means that the app will open a viewer window which shows your website content in it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Why creating an app for my website? </strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Let&#039;s face it - the world is going mobile. It&#039;s been going mobile for quite a few years now, and your website, as beautiful and content-reach as it is, is still &quot;only&quot; a website. It&#039;s hard to be unique these days, you can find numerous websites of any niche, and offering your followers to reach your content through a native app, besides from your website - is the right thing to do now if you want to stand out in this crowded world.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">But my followers can just surf to my website from their mobile device!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  True, but why not making things easier for them?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Imagine this: Someone saw an interesting article in your website. He wants to show it to a friend. He opens his mobile browser, types your website address and searches for the article.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This proccess needs to be done by your website readers EVERY TIME they want to reach your website through their phones!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  By offering them a downloadable app which will immediately send them to your website - you help them reach you faster and more easily - all they have to do is click on your app icon!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Plus, this will help your brand - imagine that your website icon will be in front of your readers&#039; eyes everytime they open their mobile devices (and we both know how many time that happens everyday).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Will i have to update my website in 2 places?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  No :-)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The WebView app you will create, acts like a mirror- it takes your website as-is and shows it in the app window. Because of that, it&#039;s always up-to-date, so whenever you add a post, change a page, update your layour or add products - everything will also be immediately updated in the app.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What else will my app do?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  That&#039;s maybe the most important part - you will learn how to add a push notifications feature, so whenever you update a post, a product or just want to announce something - you can send a push notification to all your app users and let them know immediately what&#039;s new. This is a great way to keep your users and readers updated and keep your brand in their heads all the time.  </p><p style=\"\">In addition, you will learn how to implement Admob in your app, so you can monetize your app. Please note that you cannot use Adsense ads in a Webview app - you will have to use Admob. More details about this is the &quot;Showing Ads In Your App&quot; section.</p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">I have no idea how to program, code or create apps. Is this course for me?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Absolutely.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I&#039;m not a programmer myself. I build websites for a living and i was looking for the easiest and fastest way to turn my Wordpress websites into real downloadable apps. I wouldn&#039;t create this flash course if the process wasn&#039;t easy to follow and quick to achieve - as i wouldn&#039;t learn it myself.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  If you have a website - you can have a Webview app within a few hours.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Are there any hidden fees?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">You will have to register as an Android developer. Anyone who wants to publish apps in Google Play Store must register as a developer. The process is easy and it costs a one-time fee of 25$. Please note that this fee is mandatory to whoever wants to publish apps and it has nothing to do with this course - meaning - i&#039;m not affiliated with this service and you&#039;d probably have to pay this fee if you&#039;d create an app with other courses or platforms as well. The 25$ fee is for creating as many apps as you want! So you only have to pay it once.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What exactly will i learn in this flash course?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  First, you&#039;ll learn how to sign up for an Android developer account.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Then, you will download Android Studio - which is the program we will work with. It is free to use and can be installed on PC and Mac.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Next you will create the app and configure it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The next step would be to add very little code lines to your app - again, don&#039;t worry if you&#039;re not a programmer. It&#039;s really easy!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  After that you will learn how to add the push notifications feature. This process includes registering to a push service (for free) and adding a few more code lines.  </p><p style=\"\">Next, you will learn how to monetize your app with Admob - Google&#039;s mobile ads service.</p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The last step would be to publish your app, obviously!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  It may take some time until your app will be available in the store, so while waiting - you will learn how you can turn your Wordpress website into a responsive website (if it&#039;s not responsive already).  </p>  <p style=\"\">That&#039;s it! Fast and easy. You can seriously turn your website into an app by TOMORROW.</p>",
