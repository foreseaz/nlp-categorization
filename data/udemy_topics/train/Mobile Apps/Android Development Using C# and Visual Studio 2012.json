    "description": "<p>  \t  Mobile development has become increasingly important and popular. There are two platforms that own most of the current market share: Android and IOS. Microsoft has not been successful to date in the mobile market, and developers that are comfortable using Microsoft tools may feel left behind. It is possible, however, to create mobile applications for both Android and IOS using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Mono framework. This course will serve as an introduction on how to create applications for Android using Mono and C#. It will cover basic setup, UI development, options for working with data, interfacing with other Android features, like audio, camera and GPS, and publishing the application to Google Play. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>  <p>  \t Work files for this course can be downloaded from the first lecture.  </p>",
