The term \"WebView\" means that the app will open a viewer window which shows your website content in it.</p>\n\n<p>Why creating an app for my website?</p>\n\n<p>You know there are thousands of websites out there for any niche you can think of. So having an app for your website will help you boost the things follows.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Stand out from the competitors</li><li>Will help to improve your user engagement</li><li>Build brand and recognition.</li><li>Create direct marketing channel.</li><li>You will be visible to your users all the time.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Imagine this if a user wants to open your website into his/her mobile device. Then he wants to open up his browser and have to type in your web address to reach you.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine if you have an app then he can just reach out to by a single tap on the icon of your app.</p>\n\n<p>By offering them a downloadable app which will immediately send them to your website - you help them reach you faster and more easily - all they have to do is to click on your app icon!</p>\n\n<p>Plus, this will help your brand - imagine that your website icon will be in front of your readers' eyes everytime they open their mobile devices (and we both know how many time that happens everyday).</p>\n\n<p>PS :- Why not making things easier for them?</p>\n\n<p>Will i have to update my website in 2 places?</p>\n\n<p>No</p>\n\n<p>The WebView app you will create, acts like a mirror- it takes your website as-is and shows it in the app window. Because of that, it's always up-to-date, so whenever you add a post, change a page, update your layour or add products - everything will also be immediately updated in the app.</p>\n\n<p>What else will my app do?</p>\n\n<p>That's maybe the most important part - you will learn how to add a push notifications feature, so whenever you update a post, a product or just want to announce something - you can send a push notification to all your app users and let them know immediately what's new. This is a great way to keep your users and readers updated and keep your brand in their heads all the time.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, you will learn how to implement Admob in your app, so you can monetize your app. Please note that you cannot use Adsense ads in a Webview app - you will have to use Admob. More details about this is the \"Showing Ads In Your App\" section.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I have no idea how to program, code or create apps. Is this course for me</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a programmer myself. I build websites for a living and i was looking for the easiest and fastest way to turn my Wordpress websites into real downloadable apps. I wouldn't create this flash course if the process wasn't easy to follow and quick to achieve - as i wouldn't learn it myself.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a website - you can have a Webview app within a few hours.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any hidden fees?</p>\n\n<p>You will have to register as an Android developer. Anyone who wants to publish apps in Google Play Store must register as a developer. The process is easy and it costs a one-time fee of 25$. Please note that this fee is mandatory to whoever wants to publish apps and it has nothing to do with this course - meaning - i'm not affiliated with this service and you'd probably have to pay this fee if you'd create an app with other courses or platforms as well. The 25$ fee is for creating as many apps as you want! So you only have to pay it once.</p>\n\n<p>What exactly will i learn in this flash course?</p>\n\n<ul><li>First, you'll learn how to sign up for an Android developer account.</li><li>Then, you will download Android Studio - which is the program we will work with. It is free to use and can be installed on PC and Mac.</li><li>Next you will create the app and configure it.</li><li>The next step would be to add very little code lines to your app - again, don't worry if you're not a programmer. It's really easy!</li><li>After that you will learn how to add the push notifications feature. This process includes registering to a push service (for free) and adding a few more code lines.</li><li>Next, you will learn how to monetize your app with Admob - Google's mobile ads service.</li><li>The last step would be to publish your app, obviously!</li></ul>\n\n<p>It may take some time until your app will be available in the store, so while waiting - you will learn how you can turn your Wordpress website into a responsive website (if it's not responsive already).</p>\n\n<p>That's it ! Join this course and publish your webview app within hours.</p>",
