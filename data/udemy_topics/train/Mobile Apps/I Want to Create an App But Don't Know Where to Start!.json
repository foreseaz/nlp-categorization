Are you an experienced developer looking to decide which tool to use? What platforms do you want to build for?  </p>  <p>  \t   Perhaps you are non-technical but really like the thought of creating your own app; either just for your own satisfaction, or to enhance your skills or even possibly generate a second income.  </p>  <p>  \t   What sort of app do you want to create? What is the best tool for a business app and what is the best tool for gaming app?  </p>  <p>  \t Maybe you don&#039;t want to get involved at all. You might want to outsource development to a third party. What should you be wary of? What about buying a finished app?  </p>  <p>  \t Lots of questions that hopefully this free course can guide you through.  </p>",
