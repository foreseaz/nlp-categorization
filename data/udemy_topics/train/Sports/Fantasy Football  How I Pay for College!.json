I don&#039;t bet much money at all and I have won over ten thousand dollars since I started playing in 2011. I first developed this course back before the season started and ran a test to see if it worked for someone other than me. My friend Brian was the rat; I taught him everything I could and sent him to work. Since then, Brian has won almost a thousand dollars playing Fantasy Football and Fanduel. You can do it too very easily. In this course I&#039;ll show you how.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you want to stay at home to make money, if you hate your job, if you love football, then take this course. I will show you the ins and outs of making money watching your favorite sport.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What is covered</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>How to play fantasy football</li>  \t<li>My five rules of drafting</li>  \t<li>How to build a solid team</li>  \t<li>In season management</li>  \t<li>When to play</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">12 lectures - 43 minutes of content</strong>  </p>",
