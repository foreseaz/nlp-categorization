    "description": "<p>The purpose of this <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Fantasy Football 101 </strong>course is to provide a basic overview to understand what fantasy football is, how it works, and basic terminology to get you going into your first league as a new player. With over 50 million players between the United States and Canada documented in 2015 through the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA), the growth of the sport is increasingly rising with new players entering each year.</p>\n\n<p>The course is structured in power point to highlight the frame work of fantasy football. I will explain the following <strong>8 areas</strong> of a league and insight on each.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">1.
