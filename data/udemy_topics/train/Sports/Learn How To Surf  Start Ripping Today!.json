    "description": "<p>Surfing - one of the most desirable yet difficult sports to master...until now. </p>\n\n<p>In How To Surf, ex-pro junior surfers Ryan Baohm &amp; Kale Brock take you through the fundamental teachings of surfing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the course, the underpinning skills of surfing, including paddling &amp; water negotiation, wave selection, taking off &amp; weight transfer, are emphasised with the knowledge that when these are mastered, progression through surfing's tiers becomes much, much easier &amp; efficient. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many surfers would say that it takes years to get to an advanced level of surfing, but Brock &amp; Baohm disagree. With the right coaching of the right skills in the right order, &amp; most importantly with the correct &amp; safe application, advanced surfing can be achieved in a short time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uniquely, the How To Surf online course offers ongoing online support for students who pass the 30-day course mark. Simply upload a video of you surfing to our exclusive Facebook group, &amp; we will send you feedback on how to continue improving your surfing. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
