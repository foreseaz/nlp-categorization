    "description": "<p></p><p>This inline skate course is taught through video tutorials  with accompanying training notes. Nearly 2 hours of detailed video lessons are  divided into a progressive course syllabus, allowing the skate student to learn  at their own pace through step-by-step instructions, detailed demos and  explanations. The training notes then help to structure your practice in a way  that will lead to safe and continuous learning of new skills. </p>    <p>This  course will help you learn how to skate backwards from scratch using transitions  to get there and back. You will know how to stop using two non-heel braking  methods (t-stop and lunge stop), and master higher speed turns with the  forwards crossovers and lunge turn. We will also focus on your skating  technique and learn how to skate more efficiently so that you can improve your fitness.</p>    <p>The course will take several months to complete depending on  the amount and frequency of practice time available to the student. You may be learning the skills presented here for the first time or you have been using them for a while but know they need some tweaking.</p><p></p>  ",
