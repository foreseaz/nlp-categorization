    "description": "<p>  \t <strong>By Wayne Mazzoni.  NCAA Coach Since 1992.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        This course is for high school athletes and their parents.  Ideally one should begin this course any time from the 8th grade up to fall of senior year.  The course is designed to take you at your own pace.  One section might take you two months, the next two days.  The course is set up to take you through the recruiting process in a systematic organized and structured manner.  It is developed by an NCAA College coach who has been recruiting for 20 years.  </p>  <p>  \t        There are a million sites where you can put your profile and information only to sit and wait and hope a college coach finds you. If only it was this easy. It is not.  College coaches don&#039;t log on websites to find their recruits.  </p>  <p>  \t        This course will teach you what you should and should not do to manage the process from creating your list of schools at the start to making your final college choice at the end.  </p>",
