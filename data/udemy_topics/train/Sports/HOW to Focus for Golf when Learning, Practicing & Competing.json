    "description": "<p><strong></strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>This\n course reveals why learning how to SWING GOLF CLUBS and \nlearning how to PLAY GOLF are very different skills, both of which require deliberate and independent practice. Many try the former, so few experience the latter, mistakenly striving to consciously control their actions/clubs. <br></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p>Unfortunately this traditional approach <strong>INHIBITS</strong> your potential when learning, practicing and competing.<br><strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                                                                         Existing golf coaching practices worldwide do not SYSTEMATICALLY explain or train the golfers <strong>Attentional Focus</strong> when <strong>learning</strong>, <strong>practicing</strong> and <strong>playing </strong>resulting in a wide range of frustrating symptoms, both physical and psychological. This course closes that significant education gap<strong>. </strong>NO tips. NO quick fixes<strong><strong><strong><strong>.</strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong>The purpose of this course is to help\n you  understand HOW to focus your attention appropriately when \ndeveloping technical skills, practicing  on the range and competing out \non the golf course.</strong><br><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><span></span>  </p>  <p>  \t                              You may have noticed that you do not play great golf whilst thinking about your swing/stroke but how can you regularly play<em> <strong>without</strong></em> swing thoughts if you only practice <strong><em>with</em></strong> them? HOW can you SHIFT your attention away from technique and experience performance both in practice on range and play on course? You must <strong>significantly change</strong> the way you practice golf.<strong><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course uniquely explains<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong> HOW </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>to<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong> TRAIN </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>and most significantly<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong> TRUST </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>your technical skills.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong> </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                                                                                                                                                 Learning HOW to keep your <strong>attention</strong> locked on target (enabling an<strong> external focus</strong>), whilst <strong>looking</strong> at the ball and executing your swing is the challenge of golf. The target is often missed due to erroneous <strong>conscious</strong> thoughts about your swing, the ball and or un/desirable outcomes in the <strong>SECONDS</strong> prior to or during execution. Consequently, your attention is frequently <strong>OFF</strong> target and undesirable outcomes often result. Herein lies the reason why your golf performances are so variable. Poor attentional focus lies at the heart of them.  </p>    <p>  \t                                                                                                                                                                 The key attributes of successful golfers explained within this golf training program include:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>State Management</li>  \t<li>Concentration</li>  \t<li>Attentional Focus</li>  \t<li>Targeting</li>  \t<li>Visualization<br>  \t</li>  \t<li>Acceptance</li>  </ul>    <p>  \t                                                                                                                                    This course content takes approximately 5 hours.
