    "description": "<p><strong>**UPDATED MAY 2016**</strong> Called <em><strong>\"a must have for anyone looking to get new leads for their business without cold calling. Simply THE BEST\"</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>  \t   Landing new clients to grow your business doesn't have to be nightmare...  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   There's <strong>a better way than cold calling</strong> and going to networking events that rarely yield meaningful results...yet for some reason people keep approaching growing their business this way!?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   In this course, I want to teach you how to connect with any potential client you want using cold emails.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Can you imagine being 1 click away for anyone that might benefit from your product or service? It's a pretty powerful place to be...and way more fun than picking up the phone to pitch yourself to someone who doesn't want to talk to you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Whether you've tried cold emailing before or this is your first time, you're going to get a ton of value out of this course. Many people I've taught <em><strong>recoup their investment in less than 1 day of implementing the strategies I teach</strong></em>!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   You'll learn things like:  </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>  \t<li>How to create a clockwork system for developing new leads and prospects to grow your business</li>  \t<li>Places to find potential clients for your business</li>  \t<li>How to find the right person to reach out to at target businesses</li>  \t<li>8+ proven methods to find anyone's email address</li>  \t<li>How to think and write like a world class copywriter</li>  \t<li>9 Cold Email rules you should always follow</li>  \t<li>4 Things you should always avoid</li>  \t<li>Eight different cold email scripts you can use today</li>  \t<li>How to increase your response rate from prospects by 50% with one little tweak</li>  \t<li>When and how you should follow up with people you're reaching out to maximize efficiency</li>  \t<li>How to convert initial cold emails to meetings and handle rebuttals like \"we don't have the money\", \"this isn't a good fit,\" or \"we already work with a competitor\"</li>  </ol>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Does having a crystal clear understanding of all of these things sound like it would supercharge your business?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   If you're not convinced, look no further than my Cold Emailing For Startups Course. It's been taken by over <strong>3,500 students</strong> and has <strong>an average 5 star review</strong>!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   I created this course because many people who took this course wanted more, and a greater focus on applying these strategies if you weren't building a technology startup.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   This course is perfect for you if:  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<li>You have a freelancing, consulting, or small business</li>  \t<li>Your customers are often small businesses, local companies or targeted individuals</li>  \t<li>You want to learn how to connect with anyone to pitch your product or service</li>  \t<li>You're tired of trying to drum up business with cold calls and ineffective networking events</li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   No matter who you are, I guarantee you'll learn at least one thing from this class (see the testimonials above for proof).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   I will personally respond to any questions you may have as you go through the material so there's no worry if you're not sure how to take all of the information and apply it to your life. So sign up now!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Talk soon,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Scott Britton  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   P.S. The $197 price is an initial offering to build the students and positive reviews.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t <em>I believe being able to start a dialogue with anyone in the world is worth way more than 30 cents a day for the next year s</em>o I plan on raising the price in the near future. If you want to take advantage of the initial price, I'd sign up sooner than later (Like now!)  </p>",
