    "description": "<p>Sales Engineers (SE's) are a critical sales team member in many companies worldwide.  They are more than just technical experts in their respective industries.  Highly successful SE's must build and maintain parallel expertise in \"soft-skill\" disciplines such as business acumen, presentation skills, building customer relationships, developing an engagement strategy, and having a thorough understanding of the targeted industry.  There is a \"soft-skill gap\" that exists in many Sales Engineering organizations.  This \"gap\" can be the driving difference between a highly successful technical sales organization and a mediocre one.  The meSE education and certification program is focused on closing this \"gap\", enhancing the SE skills in these areas, and proving proficiency.</p>",
