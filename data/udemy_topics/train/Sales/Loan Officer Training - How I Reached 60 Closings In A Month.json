    "description": "<p>This Loan Officer Coaching Course is focused on teaching Loan Officers and even Mortgage Branch Managers how to more effectively utilize the tools and resources available to them to establish and expand their personal brand online among realtors as well as help you improve your cold calling skills for better returns not to mention how to handle your face to face meetings. Example calls, voice mail messages and even contact lists of agents and more are provided. This course wants you to reach at least 10 closings a month within 6 months for non team based LO's and more if you are a team based LO. I will also provide a growing number of Q&amp;A Videos where I will answer your specific questions 5 at a time as follow up content. You will also find example phone calls, voice messages and more in the coming weeks.<br></p>",
