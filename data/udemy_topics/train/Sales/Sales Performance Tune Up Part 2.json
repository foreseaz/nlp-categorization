You should start there.  </p>  <p>  \tHaving done great discovery sessions with our prospect we are now ready to build a solution and demonstrate how we address their needs. We cover how to build and present your demo, how to handle objections, how to negotiate a winning outcome and what you need to do when you lose! This is where the rubber meets the road.  </p>  <p>  \tCourse structure is the same as Pt 1 with short quizzes at the end of key sections to validate that you get it before moving on. Content can be revisited anytime.  </p>  <p>  \tIt is recommended that you complete the course and then come back and apply each section to your SPECIFIC sales cycles that you are in at this moment.  </p>",
