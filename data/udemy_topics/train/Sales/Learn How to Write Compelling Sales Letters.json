And then, after clicking on that “Send” button </span><span>that would send it to my list, I would wait nervously for the sales to come in. But </span><span>minutes and then hours passed and no one on my list was ordering the products I was </span><span>selling. The worst part was that it seemed that everyone else seemed to make money on </span><span>the Internet, except me! I was confused, sad and even angry.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>In the following years, I was lucky enough to meet and work for some of the best people </span><span>in the business, first as a regular copywriter and then as a sales copywriter. And not only </span><span>did I learn from these successful marketers, I also came up with techniques that allowed </span><span>me to create the perfect sales letter - the sales letter that automatically boosts </span><span>the conversion rates of whatever you’re selling by 10, 20, 30% or more!</span>  </p>  <p>  \tI have spent 5 years of my life analyzing what makes a great <span>sales letter. I have tested and re-tested hundreds of letters </span><span>before finding a template that maximizes your profits every time. This is what I am going to teach you in this course.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t<span>Nicolas Henrion</span>  </p>",
