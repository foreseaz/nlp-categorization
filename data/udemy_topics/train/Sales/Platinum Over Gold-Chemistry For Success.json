    "description": "<p>Choosing to treat others they way they want to be treated and not the way \"we\" want to be treated will benefit you in all your interpersonal communications.  Determining the predominant behavioral style of individuals and learning to adapt to connect with them in a way they can relate to will allow for less conflict, more understanding and tremendous success.  When you can predict what someone wants and give it to them, you develop a rapport with that person that is often lifelong.  In sales, management, leadership, team building, and personal relationships you will be highly successful.  You will stop looking at sales as a contest, a notch in your belt, a one time shot and look at it as a collaboration or a partership where you understand what your customer wants and you know how to present it to them to show the product or service will provide the solution for it.  You will have the skills to develop the trust and belief that makes them a lifelong customer and provider of endless referrals. Connecting through chemistry creates the strong foundation you need to build your empire.  </p>",
