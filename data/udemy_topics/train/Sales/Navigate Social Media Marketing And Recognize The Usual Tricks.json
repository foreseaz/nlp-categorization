    "description": "<p>\n\t   Selling Outside the Square and Making Money consists of 20 lectures that average between 6 to 9 minutes long - so the time invested hovers between 2 to 3 hours. However, it is money well spent because students will not only learn powerful marketing tricks and techniques that marketers use on unsuspecting consumers, but author Bob Boog  shows students how to use this information to make about $500 per client (or more) assisting businesses with their social marketing needs. Students will also learn how to sell businesses on the need for social marketing. The information gleaned from this course can be utilized quickly and easily by students to make money in the real world. A  sample contract used by Mr. Boog to negotiate services for one of his clients, for example, is found in the resource section. And as long as a student is familiar with social marketing, (Facebook, Twitter, etc) Mr. Boog believes that he or she can their services for employment in this field. The author strongly believes the need for social marketing management is only going to increase- so this well may be the start of a new career for students. One that might be fun and easy to do, too! Materials needed are a pen and paper (or smart phone) to take notes.\n</p>",
