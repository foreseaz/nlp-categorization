    "description": "<p>  \t   This Course comprises of a series of videos created with  Alan McCarthy the head coach of RDC.<br>  \t     It looks at:  </p>  <p>  \t<ul>  \t\t<li><strong>Gathering  information</strong>, the questions you need to ask and how to use the answer. For  this we use our Information Arc process</li>  \t\t<li>We’ll then move on to the actual interface with  the client and look at how to <strong>build  rapport</strong>. We’ll look at what rapport is, how to get it and what to do with  it once you have it.</li>  \t\t<li>We&#039;ll then consider the thorny subject of <strong>handling objections</strong>. We&#039;ll look at the  four types of objection you will get, their styles and how to overcome each  one.</li>  \t\t<li>Finally we&#039;ll look at <strong>closing the deal</strong>. How to use the information you have, the rapport  you have built and objections that have come up in the sales process, to move  the deal towards a close.</li>  \t</ul>  \t<p>  \t\t<p>  \t\t\t   What we don&#039;t cover in this course are more complex parts of  the sale process such as:  \t\t</p>  \t\t<p>  \t\t\t<ul>  \t\t\t\t<li>competition analysis, </li>  \t\t\t\t<li>the decision making unit, </li>  \t\t\t\t<li>and qualifying a deal</li>  \t\t\t</ul>  \t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t   as these are covered in our other courses  \t\t\t\t</p>",
