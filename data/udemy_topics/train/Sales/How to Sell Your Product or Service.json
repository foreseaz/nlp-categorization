In this course you&#039;ll learn how to sell more effectively and consistently by using a sales process.  Whether you&#039;re selling a product or a service, having a defined sales process will increase your likelihood of closing more deals.  </em></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">This course includes how to develop a product or service inventory to better position your value.  You&#039;ll also learn how to target the right client profile so your sales close rate will go UP!  Another big challenge we&#039;ll cover in this course is how to position yourself against your competition.  Discover how to develop a sales matrix that will allow you to map out your strengths and weaknesses relative to your top competitors.  Knowing this will allow you to tailor your sales presentation, which is also covered in this course, so that you can communicate your value relative to your competitors.  </em></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\"></em>Another key aspect of learning how to sell effectively is being able to understand what the customer wants to hear and/or see from you.  We&#039;ll cover how to ask the right questions in order to get to the essence of what customers want.  Doing so will shorten your sales cycle (i.e., how long it will take you to close a sale) and minimize your time spent with the client.  </p><p style=\"\">Lastly, we will also discuss pricing.  When is the best time to present pricing and how should you present pricing without scaring them off or shocking them.</p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Course Outline:</em><br style=\"\"></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Introduction</li><li style=\"\">Acquiring the sales mindset</li><li style=\"\">Doing your fba product inventory</li><li style=\"\">Profiling your ideal client</li><li style=\"\">Developing a comparative matrix (analysis)</li><li style=\"\">Creating your sales process</li><li style=\"\">Meeting the client &amp; the right questions to ask</li><li style=\"\">What to include in your presentation</li><li style=\"\">The best way to demo your product or service</li><li style=\"\">Presenting the client with options</li><li style=\"\">What types of pricing options to use</li><li style=\"\">Sales process review with key things to remember</li></ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">(Videos ARE Downloadable : 12 videos, 1 hour and 6 minutes)</em>  </p>",
