This course teaches you that gold standard!</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t     This course is full of advice that is useful and practical but not commonly applied. Be assured it contains no management jargon! It just has the skills you need to sell well. The tips, tricks and techniques to master those sales meetings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t     Selling is probably the hardest part of business but also the part which, when done as it should be done, will most benefit your business.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t     This course condenses all sales knowledge, allowing you to reach that gold standard sooner. This course is also useful for those who do not sell products and services directly, this is because almost everyone sells in some sense and at some time. There is a lot in this course that will show you how to be more persuasive to other people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t     While the things that people sell vary greatly over time, the way to sell them changes little!\r\n</p>",
