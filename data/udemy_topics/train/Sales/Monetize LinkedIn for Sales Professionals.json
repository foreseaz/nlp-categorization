    "description": "<p><strong>If you are in B2B sales</strong>, than it is pretty darn important that all of the effort you put in to LinkedIn, social selling and online activities converts into business.  Often we invest hours and hours every week, yet the ROI (return on investment) isn't there yet.  Many aren't seeing their activity convert to clients because they don't know what activities to do on a daily basis, aren't clear on how to engage with the right message and are missing the most valuable step... getting the initial phone call. </p><p>In this course you will learn how to position yourself as a subject matter expert, attract and engage your target market and covert them into phone calls and ultimately new business.</p>",
