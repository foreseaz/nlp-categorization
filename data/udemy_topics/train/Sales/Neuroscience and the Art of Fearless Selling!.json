    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Increase Your Sales By 30%+  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t In a recent survey, sales managers said that most salespeople leave 30% - 50% of their sales behind.  This happens because they are weak in just one area of the sales process.  For example, if they can&#039;t get enough appointments, it does not matter how good they are at closing. Their overall results are going to be weak.  Salespeople know what they need to change but seldom follow through.  What stops them is not a lack of skills. It is a mental block that they need to breakthrough.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\"> This training teaches you neuroscience techniques to breakthrough any mental block!</strong>  You will also learn how to access peak states of performance so you are fearless in any selling situation.  <strong style=\"\">This is not sales training it is mind training!</strong>  </p>",
