    "description": "<p>Welcome to the fundamentals of successful selling.</p>  <p>We are all exposed to sales, everyday of our lives. Even when you’re convincing your partner that you should go on a holiday – you’re also selling the idea to them. In the USA and many parts of the world, good sales managers now earn more than doctors and lawyers, so a career in sales is a serious opportunity.</p>  <p>But sales is just the final step in the marketing process and smart sales people will adhere to the rules of marketing and real world economics. This means that Money is not “unlimited” and we must learn to<strong> </strong>target the right people with the right product before we learn how to sell it in a highly efficient and profitable way. Because some people live on credit cards, many Americans and Europeans belief the illusion that the supply of money is “unlimited” and they think we can sell anything to anyone. Now that sounds nice but the fact is that in our world, wealth disparity is on the rise, so the wealthy segment is growing, where rich people have more money than ever and at the same time, the poor segment is also growing because the middle class is shrinking. </p>  <p>So if you want to belief that you can sell ice to an eskimo, this course is not for you.
