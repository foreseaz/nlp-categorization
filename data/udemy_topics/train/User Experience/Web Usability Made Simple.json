As well as providing a high level overview for this and other related courses from the same OUXI curriculum <a href=\"http://www.ouxinstitute.com/Curriculum/TrainingTracks/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OUXI Curriculum Training Tracks\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">training track</a>, it will explain how the <strong style=\"\">small fees </strong>you invest in these courses could <strong style=\"\">pay off in thousands of dollars </strong>in increased revenues from your ecommerce website.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course addresses one of three key aspects of the User eXperience of eCommerce and other websites: <strong style=\"\">usability</strong> (other courses in the OUXI curriculum will address designing for <em style=\"\">persuasion </em>and <em style=\"\">graphic design</em>).  </p>  <p>  \t  The course is very <strong style=\"\">concrete, </strong>a <strong style=\"\">&quot;how-to&quot; </strong>course offering clear, <strong style=\"\">actionable guidelines </strong>and <strong style=\"\">hands-on exercises</strong>.  These website usability <strong style=\"\">guidelines </strong>are not based on subjective opinion - they have all been <strong style=\"\">well established by </strong>rigorous, published <strong style=\"\">research </strong>from disciplines such as cognitive science and computer-human interaction.  Each guideline is <strong style=\"\">fully explained </strong>and <strong style=\"\">generously illustrated </strong>with many examples from real websites.  </p>  <p>  \t  The <strong style=\"\">34 design guidelines</strong> offered were selected from the full body of knowledge on web usability to be: <em style=\"\">universal</em> (i.e., applicable to any and all websites), <em style=\"\">easy to explain, commonly violated, high impact</em>, and <em style=\"\">easy to implement</em>. They represent the <strong style=\"\">&quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;</strong> in designing for web usability.  </p>  <p>  \t  With nothing beyond these 34 key guidelines, anyone should be able to <strong style=\"\">realize major improvements</strong> in the usability of their website, which will <strong style=\"\">contribute measurably</strong> to the <strong style=\"\">success</strong> of the site in meeting its <strong style=\"\">business goals</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">COURSE FORMAT</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  The course format is a <strong style=\"\">Powerpoint presentation</strong> accompanied by a <strong style=\"\">studio-recorded video lecture</strong>, broken up into chapters and lectures.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Downloadable course materials</strong> include the <strong style=\"\">full Powerpoint presentation </strong>in <strong style=\"\">two formats </strong>- full slides, and two slides per page - and an actionable, Excel-based <strong style=\"\">guidelines checklist </strong>that can be used as you apply your new skills to real web projects.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course includes <strong style=\"\">about 3 hours of lecture</strong>, and <strong style=\"\">roughly 1.5 - 2 hours </strong>of hands-on <strong style=\"\">exercises</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t  Both quick (a couple of minutes) and more comprehensive (roughly 45 minutes) optional hands-on <strong style=\"\">exercises</strong>, followed by <strong style=\"\">sample exercise solutions</strong>, help reinforce your understanding of the guidelines.  </p>  <p>  \t  Your registration for this course entitles you to <strong style=\"\">30 minutes of &quot;office hours&quot;</strong> with the instructor via email.  You can email questions to the instructor and receive personal responses.  Send email to drdeb@ouxinstitute.com with &quot;OUXI D15&quot; in the subject line.  </p>",
