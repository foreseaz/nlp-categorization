You can go from ZERO experience to a professional iOS 8 mobile app designer in just a few short weeks.(or days depending on how fast you move!)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                     Create amazing user experience and bring those awesome ideas of yours to life!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                                      Have you ever had an idea for an app? If you have, this is probably what happened. You told your friends and some of them said, &quot;that is a great idea.&quot; Others may have said, &quot;I am not quite sure what you are talking about.&quot; You may have even approached a developer who quoted you an arm and a leg.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Imagine</strong> if you had the ability to design the interface that you can picture in your head with such clarity.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                                      When I started my first business, I was ready. I designed how the app would look, feel, and flow. I then created a clickable prototype so potential customers and investors could actually see what the app would be like.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                                        This allowed me to raise 100k in seed funding, find a programmer to develop the app for equity, and launch my first successful business at the age of 21.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                                                                                                      The crazy part is, its not that hard! I taught myself everything I know, and thus take a different approach to teaching.
