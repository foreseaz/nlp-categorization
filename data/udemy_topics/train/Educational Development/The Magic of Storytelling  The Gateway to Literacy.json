Discover playful and creative ways to engage children in speaking and writing about their lives through imaginary play.</p><p>This course follows the research of Vivian Paley, examining our adult perceptions of children's learning and the value of imaginary play.  We will examine the work of Vygotsky and Dewey as they describe the child as a social learner, becoming knowledgeable within the context of group work.  Finally we will encourage teachers to take a leap of faith in modeling storytelling based upon the real stories occurring in your classroom.</p><p>This course includes over 60 minutes of quality classroom video and pdf article downloads.<br></p>",
