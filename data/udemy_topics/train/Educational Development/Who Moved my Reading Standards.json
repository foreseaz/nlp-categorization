There is about 2 hours of content, broken down into small chunks/videos that last no longer than 5 minutes, so you can learn at your own pace.  The course is broken into 7 sections that tackle each myth, give you information about the Common Core Reading Standards and then give you practical strategies you can use right away in your classroom.  In addition to the screen shot videos, there is a note taking sheet to help you get the most from the course and a handout with all of the tips listed from the course.\r\n</p>",
