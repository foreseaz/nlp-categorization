Some have stronger rote abilities and can do spatial, matching and perceptual tasks with greater ease than their peers. Some may excel at mathematics and science. The task for the teacher is to know that the student with ASD will have a mixed ability of strengths and weaknesses. In the best classroom, the teacher focuses on the studentâ€™s strengths while teaching to the specific weaknesses.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  A good teacher will always develop an interest in their students.  A good teacher in an integrated classroom will also need to have an understanding of autism.  This class will provide you will ideas to assist ALL children.  </p>",
