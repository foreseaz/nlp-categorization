The course begins with information about what college is all about in terms of 1) learning what&#039;s most important and 2) the qualities that employers look for in college graduates regardless of major. After an analysis of why college is so expensive and what constitutes a good educational value, the remainder of the course demonstrates a step-by-step method for comparing schools that doesn&#039;t involve marketing hype. Using this method will make it more likely that you&#039;ll identify which college or university is the best value for you.<br></p>  ",
