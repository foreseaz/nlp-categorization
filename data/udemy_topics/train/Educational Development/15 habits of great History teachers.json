    "description": "<p>I'm delighted to present this online course; \"15 habits of great History teachers\". </p><p>This course contains 15 stand alone lectures, each detailing a different \"habit\" of great History teachers. Drawn from my 8 years experience as a History teacher in British state schools, working alongside inspiring and gifted colleagues, I came up with the list which has now formed the basis for this online course. Alongside videos, there are also many supporting documents including a KS3 2015 assessment matrix. The aim of the course is to help History teachers, old and new, prospective and accomplished, to reflect on and further develop their professional practice. </p>",
