    "description": "<p>  \t    For children with learning difficulties, challenges in learning occur  not only from lesson content, but also from neurological and  psychological brain immaturities and differences. As such, many of these  children have learning issues associated with what ReMinds terms the  “Triple M Challenges”. That is, Motivation, Memory and Metacognitive  Thinking. This program will explain and address these challenges.  </p>  <p>  \t  Motivation underpins learning for all of us throughout out lives. However, for children with learning difficulties, specific demotivators may affect learning psychologically even more than neurologically if not dealt with appropriately.  </p>  <p>  \t  In addition, teaching and instruction may be in vain if information is forgotten frequently due to problems with short term, working and long term memory. Discover how this is related to issues of storage and retrieval.  </p>  <p>  \t  Metacognition is essence relates to self awareness. This course will explain how delays in metacognitive thinking impact on learning and academic performance.  </p>",
