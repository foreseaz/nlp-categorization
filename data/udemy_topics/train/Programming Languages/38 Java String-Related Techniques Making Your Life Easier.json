It can get from simple to very complex and frustrated, especially for inexperienced developers.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In this course, I want to exclusively focus on guiding different techniques that you might often encounter during daily programming tasks.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The course is a collection of more than 38 string related methods that support you in developing java applications with less painful and effort. No matter what kinds of applications you are building: desktop applications, web applications, or mobile applications, string manipulations are inevitable.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  At the end of this course, you will be able to use different kinds of methods on proceeding string related requirements more easily and effectively with less overhead.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  String manipulation is actually a wide topic. But after completing the course, I believe you should have solid and fundamental skills in processing strings and you can use those methods presented in the course to solve almost all common string related tasks.  </p>",
