I often see courses claiming that you can \"Learn To Make Video Games (No Programming Needed!)\".But unfortunately if you want to make anything more advanced than flappy bird, you cant. Learning a programming language is <strong>fundamental </strong>to any career in the software industry, games or otherwise, and C++ is a <strong>great starting point</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is aimed at programmers wishing to learn the basics of C++ development. <strong>No prior knowledge</strong> of C++ and/or object orientated programming is required as I will starting from the very bottom and working upwards. By the end of the course you will be able to program confidently in C++, and possess a set of skills that can be easily transferred to other programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to <strong>communicate</strong> with my students as much as possible! If you have a question I'm always available to <strong>ask! </strong>And I'll try my best to solve your problem; <strong>programming or otherwise.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe in <strong>quality over quantity</strong>, I try to keep my lectures <strong>short and concise</strong> so you can take it all in, and easily refer back to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in <strong>crisp 1080p</strong>, and each section comes with <strong>written material</strong> to recap what you've learned. <strong>This truly is one of the best ways to learn.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember!</strong> All Udemy courses come with a <strong>30 day refund</strong> if you're not satisfied with this quality content!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take <strong>action </strong>today! <strong>Enroll </strong>and make a <strong>positive </strong>change to your career!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Preview videos are not available in HD and should not be used as a judgement of quality, only of content)</p>",
