JSP helps developers create dynamically generated HTML web pages on the fly. JSP is similar to PHP, but it uses the powerful Java programming language instead.<br><br><strong><u>Benefits of Taking This JSP/Servlets Course</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing JSP and Servlets can <strong>get you a job or improve the one you have</strong>. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, and make your software life easier, that's why it's so popular and backed by Oracle.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will help you <strong>quickly get up to speed with JSP and Servlets</strong>. I will demystify the technology and <strong>help you</strong> understand the essential concepts to <strong>build a real JSP/Servlet web application from scratch.<br><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Build a Real JSP/Servlet Application from Scratch</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is project based and<strong> you will build a fully functioning JSP/Servlet web application from scratch</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We start off with a brief overview of JSP and Servlets. Then I show you <strong>how to setup your development for JSP by installing Tomcat and Eclipse</strong>. Next, I show you how to connect Eclipse and Tomcat for rapid application development. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We cover the <strong>key JSP scripting elements: Expressions, Scriptlets and Declaration</strong>. For each scripting element, I show you working code examples along with the appropriate use-case and best practices. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You <strong>learn about the built-in objects available in JSP</strong>. Code examples demonstrate the most common built-in objects. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we cover <strong>how to read HTML form data with JSP</strong>. This includes reading form data for text fields, drop-down lists, radio buttons and checkboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then you learn <strong>how to manage application state with Sessions and Cookies</strong>. You make use of the built-in session object to keep track of actions for a unique user. You also leverage Cookies to personalize a web site for a specific user.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the course includes <strong>JDBC database integration</strong>. You learn how to leverage JDBC queries, inserts, updates and deletes in a JSP/Servlet web application.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At the end of this course</strong>, you will have a <strong>fully functional JSP/Servlet web application that connects to a database</strong>. You can use this application as a starting point for your project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All of the source code</strong> and database scripts are <strong>provided</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>You Will Learn How To</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Build a fully functioning JSP/Servlet web application from scratch</li><li>Set up your JSP/Servlet development environment with Tomcat and Eclipse</li><li>Explore JSP scripting elements: Expressions, Scriptlets and Declarations</li><li>Read HTML form data with JSP and Servlets</li><li>Include additional files in your JSP file for a standard look-and-feel</li><li>Manage application state with Sessions to track unique user actions</li><li>Leverage Cookies to personalize a web site for a specific user</li><li>Build a Multi-Lingual app using Internationlization with JSTL</li><li>Build an MVC application with JSP and Servlets</li><li>Add database support with JDBC: query, insert, update and delete</li><li>Build a complete database web app with JDBC</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong><u>Student Reviews Prove This Course's Worth</u></strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Those\n who have reviewed the course have pointed out that <strong>the instruction is \nclear and easy to follow</strong>, as well as thorough and highly informative. \nOther students<strong> enjoy the use of relevant examples throughout the course</strong>,\n as these make the content even easier to comprehend.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many students had also taken other JSP courses in the past, only to find that <strong>this JSP course was their favorite</strong>.
