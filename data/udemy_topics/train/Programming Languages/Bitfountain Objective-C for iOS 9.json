Most legacy libraries are written in the language, and you need to know how to interact with them. Learn everything you need to know by building a pirate adventure game through the expert, heartcrafted methods used in all Bitfountain courses.</p><p>Most iOS courses these days are teaching Swift. We teach Swift in our intro course too! But we also realize that the days of Objective-C are far from over. If you have a little experience coding, we'll get you building iOS 9 apps in Objective-C quickly.</p>",
