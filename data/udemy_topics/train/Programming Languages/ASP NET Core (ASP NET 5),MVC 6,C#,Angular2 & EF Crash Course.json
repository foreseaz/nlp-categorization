ASP.NET has a lot of the unused code in the .NET framework. Since ASP.NET 1.0 (Over 15 years old), there's a lot of  legacy code that has to load even when it is not being utilized in your web projects. This can cause performance issues in your web apps. <strong>ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET 5)</strong> solves this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ASP.NET Core (ASP.NET 5)</strong> is built with the needs of modern Web applications in mind. <strong>ASP.NET Core <strong>(ASP.NET 5)</strong></strong> is built to be cloud-ready by introducing environment-based configuration and by providing built-in dependency injection support.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ASP.NET Core <strong>(ASP.NET 5)</strong></strong> supports cross-platform development on Windows, Mac and Linux.
