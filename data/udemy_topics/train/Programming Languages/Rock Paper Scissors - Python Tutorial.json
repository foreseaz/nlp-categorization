    "description": "<p>Welcome to my 4-lecture course on how to create a rock, paper, scissors program with Python.</p>  <p><strong>Python is a command line based program which allows users to code in a lot of ways allowing them to make very advanced programs. </strong>I have been learning Python for several months now and enjoy using it to code some really cool programs.</p>  <p>This course will take you through creating the program which includes features like:</p>  <ul><li>Loops</li><li>Variables</li><li>Prints</li><li>Inputs</li><li>Randoms</li><li>Time Delay</li><li>Accounts</li></ul>              <p>The course will take you just over 30 mins and will teach you pretty much most aspects of the program. In the first lecture I show you the end result of what we will be making, this gives you an idea if you want to continue the course. In the next lectures 2-4 I design the program and in the last lecture I conclude the course.</p><p>Just to make you aware this program is made in Python 3, if you are using an older version the program may not work.</p>  <p>I am making this course FREE (at the moment) to help out everyone who wants to learn more about Python. </p>  <p>If you are unsure on anything don't hesitate to contact me. </p>",
