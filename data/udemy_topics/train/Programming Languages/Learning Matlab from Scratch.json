They basically either jump directly to programming code, and leaving the rest behind, or focus mainly on the basics of <em style=\"\">Matlab</em> without giving it&#039;s programming features a try. </p><p>So, you may have to buy two courses to be good in <em style=\"\">Matlab</em>. In this course I put all my effort to start with <em style=\"\">Matlab</em> basics, and then after we have a strong foundation we move to the next level.</p><p>We will learn:</p><ul style=\"\"><li><em style=\"\">Matlab</em> user interface.</li><li>Basic Arithmetic in <em style=\"\">Matlab</em>.</li><li>Symbolic Calculations in <em style=\"\">Matlab</em></li><li>Algebra.</li><li>Calculus.</li><li>Data Visualizations.</li><li>Programming fundamentals.</li><li>GUI in <em style=\"\">Matlab</em>.</li><li> Deploying your built apps</li></ul><p><br style=\"\"></p><p>And all of that is completely <strong style=\"\">FREE</strong>, and <strong style=\"\">step by step</strong> guide. </p><p>THROUGH beginning until you become an expert in <em style=\"\">Matlab</em>.    </p>",
