If you are new to OOP or are looking to brush up on your programming knowledge perhaps for an interview or just for fun! This course will quickly get you up to speed on the important concepts of OOP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Language agnostic, the concepts presented in this course can EASILY be applied to any programming language that supports the notion of 'classes and properties'. Including C++, C#, VB.Net, Javascript or PHP.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will start the course with a brief introduction. Then dive into understanding exactly what  the terms '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Abstraction</strong>', '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Encapsulation</strong>', '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Inheritance</strong>', '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Poly-morphism</strong>', '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Association<em>',</em>  </strong>'<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Aggregation</strong>' and '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Composition</strong>' really mean. Next, we will take a look at these concepts in action with some simple examples. And how easy it can be to adopt a good programming style from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Delivered using <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">HD Video, PDF, lecture and code samples</em> (c# projects provided), this course will give you the knowledge and skills needed to put these concepts into practice and become a better developer today!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to be a comprehensive introduction and should require about 1-2hrs viewing time, plus an equal amount of time if you wish to code the samples yourself (optional).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Udemy 30 day money back guarantee</strong>, this course will be <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">yours for life</strong>!<br> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So, If you are looking to revise for an exam or interview, improve you coding style, get that new job or just understand the concepts used by professionals today then this course is for you. </p>\n\n<p>If you need to know why '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Code Re-Use and Recycling</strong>' is important. Or how '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Good Design reduces flaws</strong>' and how '<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">an Object Oriented Program is much easier to modify and maintain than a non-Object Oriented Program</strong>' then this course is for you. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Simply click the '<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Take this class</strong></em>' button today to get the skills that you deserve.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I look forwards to seeing you on the inside...<br></p>",
