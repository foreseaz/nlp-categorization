    "description": "<p>Ever wondered how large amounts of data is stored in computers and still accessed efficiently? In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data so that it can be used efficiently.</p><p>In this course, we will learn about these data structures. We will cover the most popular data structures used to store data which includes binary search trees, heaps, hash tables and graphs. Complete with code samples, you'll be able to learn alongside the instructor.  This course is designed for programmers with some basic knowledge of C++.</p><p>This course is broken down into easy to assimilate lectures and after each section there is problem set which challenges you to work on problems related to that section. The course provides comprehensive explanation of data structures binary search trees, heaps, hash tables and graphs. By the end of this course, you will be able to code these data structures and understand how to perform operations on these data structures.</p>",
