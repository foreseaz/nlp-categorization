    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">C programming</strong> is the root or foundation for any person who wants to <strong style=\"\">master computer programming</strong>. <strong style=\"\">Learning C in a comprehensive manner</strong> is very essential for every <strong style=\"\">software</strong> interested soul but things can only be interesting when words are not jargon and every piece of <strong style=\"\">code is explained</strong> in detailed manner and thatâ€™s what this course is all about.  </p>  <p>  \t  Meet the most <strong style=\"\">comprehensive online C programming</strong> course and <strong style=\"\">C tutorials video series</strong>. This series will help you to understand basics of programming by introducing <strong style=\"\">data types, constants, and variables.</strong> Further we will learn in <strong style=\"\">C coding</strong> about various <strong style=\"\">operations</strong> that can be performed like <strong style=\"\">arithmetic operations, relational operations, logical operations and bitwise operations.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  After completing these basic operations we will master intermediate topics like <strong style=\"\">while loops, do while loops and for loops</strong> along with lots of <strong style=\"\">conditional operations</strong>. Further in the advance section of this <strong style=\"\">online C tutorial</strong>, we will explore about <strong style=\"\">functions, arrays, union and structures in C programming language. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  If you have <strong style=\"\">never coded before</strong> in life, then <strong style=\"\">C </strong>is a great point to start with. Basics of <strong style=\"\">C programming language</strong> will help you to jump in lots of language like <strong style=\"\">c plus plus, python, ruby or php</strong>. Mastering other languages becomes easy, once you have <strong style=\"\">mastered C programming language</strong>. C is one of the most important of all programming languages. It is used to program desktop applications, compilers, tools and utilities and even hardware devices.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">C is a general-purpose programming language</strong> initially developed by <strong style=\"\">Dennis Ritchie</strong> between 1969 and 1973 at <strong style=\"\">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">C is often used</strong> for &quot;<strong style=\"\">system programming</strong>&quot;, including implementing <strong style=\"\">operating systems</strong> and embedded <strong style=\"\">system applications</strong>, due to a combination of desirable characteristics such as <strong style=\"\">code portability</strong> and <strong style=\"\">efficiency</strong>, ability to <strong style=\"\">access specific hardware addresses</strong> and <strong style=\"\">low run-time demand</strong> on system resources. C can also be used for <strong style=\"\">website programming</strong> using CGI as a &quot;<strong style=\"\">gateway</strong>&quot; for information between the <strong style=\"\">Web application, the server, and the browser</strong>. Some reasons for choosing C over interpreted languages are its <strong style=\"\">speed, stability</strong>, and <strong style=\"\">near-universal availability</strong>.  </p>",
