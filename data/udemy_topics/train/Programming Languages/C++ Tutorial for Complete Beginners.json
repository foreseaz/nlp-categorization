    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course teaches you the powerful, fast and popular C++ programming language from scratch, assuming only basic computer knowledge.  If you want to develop apps that squeeze the most power from your computer -- high-end desktop games or complex artificial intelligence programs, for instance -- or if you want to use a language that let&#039;s you get close to your machine and access all of your computer&#039;s hardware, C++ is the language for you. While C++ is quite challenging, in this course we&#039;ll learn the basics step by step; towards the end of the course you&#039;ll learn how to create a beautiful &quot;particle fire&quot; program, including a smattering of the basic principles of game development.  </p>",
