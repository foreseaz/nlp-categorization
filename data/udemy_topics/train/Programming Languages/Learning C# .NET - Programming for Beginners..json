Professor Mike McMillan goes through the fundamentals of the language structure, and gradually lays the groundwork for you to build your own apps.</p>  <p style=\"\">In 114 separate tutorials, Mike gives you a solid working knowledge of object-oriented programming, even if you&rsquo;re completely new to coding. He demonstrates how to use variables and data types, objects and classes, arrays, inheritance and polymorphism and distinguishes how working in C# differs from other types of code. Once you gain your confidence in the underlying areas, you&rsquo;ll be ready to complete the functional To-Do List app that is integrated into the course.</p>",
