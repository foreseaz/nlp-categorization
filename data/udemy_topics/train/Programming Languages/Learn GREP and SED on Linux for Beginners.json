    "description": "<p>One of the most important tasks we undertake in Linux is <strong>processing text in files</strong>. This course explores two powerful tools we have to do this: <strong>grep and sed</strong>. Grep and sed find and manipulate text in files using <strong>regular expressions</strong>, which use special characters for searching and replacing text.<br><br>In the course, we’ll introduce regular expression syntax in the context of learning grep, then apply what we’ve learned as we work with sed. Topics include:<br><br> - finding text with grep<br> - regular expression syntax<br> - meta characters<br> - validating emails and phone numbers<br> - intro to sed<br> - replacing text in files<br> - line number addressing<br> - outputting only found lines<br> - printing line numbers<br> - adding text before and after lines<br> - simple sed scripts<br><br>The course is in two units, and runs just over an hour in length.</p>",
