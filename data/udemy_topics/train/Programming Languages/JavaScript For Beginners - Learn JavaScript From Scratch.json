With all the different programming languages out there it can be hard to find one to start off with yet alone find a good course that will show you how to learn the language effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of all this I put together a JavaScript basics course that will show you as a complete beginner how to begin creating programs using JavaScript. This course is created for anyone brand new to web development, or simply for those who know HTML, CSS, or any other programming language but have never worked with JavaScript before.</p>",
