See it to believe it.</p><p>This course takes you to the journey of learning Java programming language in a very interesting and engaging way.</p><p>There are animated concept videos, which are highly engaging to learn concepts quickly in less than 5 minutes with a recap in each video. Hence the whole course can be done in 5 hours. </p><p>The journey start from the very basics and you gradually build on concepts, learn to solve problems and in no time you will be developing some complex applications. </p><p>We believe in learning by doing. There are level based challenges, you keep doing and increase your levels.</p><p>Your journey will have following attractions that you would love to experience:</p><p>1. Concept videos - A concept is white-boarded in an animated way.</p><p>2. Code demonstrations - The concept video is followed by a code demo. </p><p>3. Problem solving at different levels - Throw a use case and then solve it step-by-step. There are multiple levels of problem solving for every concept.</p><p>4. Retention quizzes - A good set of questions for revision and retention.</p><p>5. Programming challenges - A different level of programming challenge after every problem solving exercise.</p><p>This course has been developed using the latest learning pedagogy by the team of Subject Matter Experts, Instructional designers, Video and Voice Artists to give the learner an “Aha!” experience.</p><p>We have worked very hard to develop this course and make it interesting and thorough. But we are not adamant and will work on your feedback to improve it further.</p><p>So lets start the interesting journey now.</p>",
