And pleasing not just in visual appreciation but also the how the design of the code contributes toward the purpose of creating value for users. With thoughtful consideration, it&#039;s possible to decompose the notion of beauty, or good versus bad code, into a set of characteristics that can be used to evaluate alternative styles of code. Code itself is like art, it&#039;s subjective. With the right context and a mutual appreciation of consistency, you can create beautiful code.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Words can&#039;t describe what I can show, watch the free introduction (below) to understand more about what you&#039;ll take away from this course.</p>",
