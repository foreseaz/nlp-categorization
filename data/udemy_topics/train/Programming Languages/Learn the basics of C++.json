The cource starts out with the basic stuff such as printing stuff on the screen, taking input and variables. Then we get into loops, functions, etc.. then we will mix up stuff, like using functions to run for loops and print out arrays.</p><p>Programming can be looked at as building, you want to build a house, you will need all the material first. This is what this course is built on, we start teaching basic stuff. That is our material. Then we use our material to build stuff, using functions with a for loop to print out an array. Using everything we know to build bigger things.</p>",
