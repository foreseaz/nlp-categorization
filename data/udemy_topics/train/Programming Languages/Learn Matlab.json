And this tutorial does exactly that.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tWe first go through the basics needed to begin the start of your programming journey. Such basics include but are not limited to :<br style=\"\">  \t    1. Assigning numerical values to variables<br style=\"\">  \t    2. Manipulating these variables in a meaningful way<br style=\"\">  \t    3. Creating and manipulating vectors for problem solving<br style=\"\">  \t    4. Creating and manipulating matrices for problem solving<br style=\"\">  \t    5. Plotting various graphs to effectively display information<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t    After mastering the basics, we move on to more advanced topics to manipulate data and various types of information in a more specific way.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAdvanced topics include creating a graphical user interface and utilizing the image processing toolkit in MATLAB.  This tutorial is designed to make MATLAB easier to understand and hopefully, not so scary!  </p>",
