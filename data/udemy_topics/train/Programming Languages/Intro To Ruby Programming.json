    "description": "<p>Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular web frameworks in the world, but you don't need to learn the \"Ruby\" programming language to use \"Rails\"...so most people don't! <br><br>That's a shame because Ruby is one of the most fun and easy to use programming languages to learn.  In this course I'll teach you the Ruby programming language from the ground up.</p><p>This is not a course on Rails, we'll focus only on Ruby here.  You'll quickly see just how fast and easy it is to code Ruby like a pro.  <br></p><p>Aimed at the absolute beginner, we'll start with basic programming concepts and move on from there.  </p><p>This course contains 27 videos and is just under 3 hours long.  Watch the videos at your own pace, and post questions along the way if you get stuck. You don’t need any special knowledge or tools to take this course, I'll show you everything you need to know.</p><p>Let's learn some Ruby!  </p>",
