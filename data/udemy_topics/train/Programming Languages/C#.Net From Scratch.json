I am new to programming and I don't know C Language, Can I take this course?<br></p><p>A: Yes! you are at the right place. Here I am going to teach you programming from scratch. Even if you don't know C programming language, you need not to worry. I will be starting from very basic concepts like what integer is, what string is, what double is and how to perform simple mathematical operations like addition, subtraction,multiplication and division. Then I will slowly take you to the real time world examples like with conditional statements and loops, which will make you ready to dive into the object oriented programming ocean.</p><p>We will be stepping into object oriented programming world with the real time objects students, bank customers, loans etc., And finally you will no more feel that you cannot do programming or object oriented programming.</p><p style=\"\">  \t<strong>This is what students say about the course</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Jaiyaramakrishnan Mahendran</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><span style=\"color: inherit;\">Excellent course on C#</span></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><span style=\"color: inherit;\"></span></strong>Pls come with a new course on c# advanced concepts  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Benjamin M.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><span style=\"color: inherit;\">Great Beginner's Course!</span></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"color: inherit;\"></span>Please don't pass this course by! Sure there are times where I had slight difficulty understanding the instructor due to his accent, but once you learn what's being referenced you'll be fine. This course actually filled in a lot of gaps that helped me make sense of other courses or book concepts that I've learned. Manzoor does a great job at giving you a great foundation of the C# language. You can use Visual Studio Community (FREE) and not have any issues keeping up with the code being presented here. It's 2015! Learn to code w/ Manzoor! :)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Kirsteen Mackay</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><span style=\"color: inherit;\">Excellent introduction to C# with a clear and precise teacher.</span></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"color: inherit;\"></span>Manzoor the Instructor is very prepared and organised in his approach to teaching this course. He goes at a comfortable pace that is neither too fast or slow and he explains very clearly the point of each lecture. There is just enough repetition to get the concept across, without becoming boring. I am very impressed with this course as an introduction to learning C# and think it will help me greatly as I continue on this journey.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Anjali Singh</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong><span style=\"color: inherit;\">Good explanations of the topics</span></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"color: inherit;\"></span>Thank you for providing this course for free.
