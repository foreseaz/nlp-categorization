As such we will be doing <strong style=\"\">no database development</strong> (except for a section on calling SQL statements directly if you need to).  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">All source code is included</strong> as a Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 project so you can get up and running straight away.  </p>  <p>  \t          Thank you for choosing this course and we look forward to viewing your positive reviews and feedback.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">MPire Solutions Pty Ltd</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t           * Note: The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Entity Framework</a> is Microsofts&#039; newest data access technology, and Code First allows us to create database driven applications using only C# code, with no database development required!  </p>",
