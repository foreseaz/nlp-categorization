Manzoor knows his staff and superb in his explanation and giving you all the details you need.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             Q:Hi, I am really interested in learning how to develop a web application. But, I do not have any prior knowledge of .Net. Can I learn from this course?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             A: Yes. Sure you can. Just you need to learn C#.Net and SQL Server courses of mine from same udemy portal.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             In this course in Asp.Net I am going to teach you how to create your first web app from scratch then you will learn how to work with all the standard server controls like ListBox, DropDownList, RadioButtonList, CheckBoxList BulletList, Calender and FileUpload then slowly we will move on to data controls like GridView and FormView. We will also dig into GridView and perform some advance operation like adding controls to gridview column and formation gridview rows based on data.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Latest topics will be added on regular basis.</strong>  </p>",
