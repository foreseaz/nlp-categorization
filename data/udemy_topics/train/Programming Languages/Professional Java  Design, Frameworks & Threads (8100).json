    "description": "<p>  \t    The <strong>Professional Java</strong> series will help software developers move beyond basic training. By guiding each student through three (3) distinct design &amp; delivery exercises, the programmer will take his or her first step into the realm of professional software definition, as well as delivery.  </p>  <p>  \t    The hour long video lecture is complemented by both a requirement specification (known as the Training Requirement Specification, or \"TRS\"), as well as set of hands-on lab exercises.  By the end of this training, the student will have an understanding of the most commonly used design diagram types, design patterns, requirement gathering techniques, as well as a classically iterative, or \"agile,\" research &amp; design-delivery process.  </p>",
