We then examine Node's module system, including <strong>built-in module</strong><strong>s</strong>, <strong>application modularization</strong> as well as the <strong>NPM</strong> third party module registry. From there we tackle<strong> EventEmitters</strong> and <strong>Streams</strong>, as well as utilities for interacting with the local file system. Next we look at using Node to write both client and <strong>server</strong> web applications, as well as <strong>real time</strong> integration with<strong> Socket.I</strong>O. We wrap up with writing <strong>unit tests</strong> using both the <strong>built-in assert</strong> module and third party frameworks.<br></p><p><br></p>\n\n<p>  \tSo after this training, you will be able to judge if the particular characteristics of Node can help you in your projects.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    And of course you can download all the resources of this training in the download area.  </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Note again</strong>: We're very confident to give you a <strong>30 days</strong> money-back guarantee, no questions asked, so make sure to <strong>Enroll Now</strong>!</em><br></p>\n\n<p>  \t                                See you inside =)  </p>",
