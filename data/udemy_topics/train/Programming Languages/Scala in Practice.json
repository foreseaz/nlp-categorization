    "description": "<p>Scala is a programming language designed to include advantages from both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It is a concise, agile, and scalable language that can handle lots of data in real time. Scala is a popular choice for many open source and Big Data projects. The prominent Big Data framework, Apache Spark, is also developed using Scala.</p>  <p>Adastra Academy’s ‘Scala in Practice’ includes a general overview, the benefits of programming in Scala, and several hands-on exercises. Unlike other courses, students taking ‘Scala in Practice’ quickly become proficient in coding and develop a Mobile App as part of the course work. We also explore Scala’s main features that make it a unique programming language and various enterprise applications to understand why it is more often deployed than others. </p>",
