    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   In this course, we&#039;ll be walking hands-on-tutorial-style through the creation of an automated trading strategy using C# and the NinjaTrader platform, as well as methods for testing out its potential success. By the end of the lectures, you should be able to not only create a simple trading strategy, but also understand how to test it against historical market data, debug it, and even log data into a custom database for further analysis. Even if you have limited C# and trading strategy experience, the examples in this book will provide a great foundation for getting into automated trading and safely testing out strategy ideas before risking real money in the market.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   This video walks through the same material presented in the e-book Automated Trading with C# and NinjaTrader 7.<a href=\"https://leanpub.com/csharpninjatrading\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\"></a>  </p>",
