    "description": "<p>  \t    &quot;Scilab for Beginners&quot; takes a little bit more than 1 hour to introduce you to the main feature of Scilab: Matrices, Vectors and Scalars computation.  </p>  <p>  \t  The videos include many Scilab sessions to demonstrate the matrices, vectors and scalars definition and manipulation.<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \t    The &quot;basic&quot; operations introduced here are not so basis, as they are globally managed matrices, vectors and scalars manipulation.  </p>  <p>  \t    The addition and subtraction are intuive, as they are element by element operations. But the multiplication is the matricial global one, and you have to know a littke bit of linear algebra to understand it. The exponent and even matrices division are also introduced in that course.  </p>  <p>  \t    By the end of the course, you will be able to use Scilab as a high level caculator. You will be also ready to use Scilab as a laboratoty in our forthcoming series of courses in practical mathematics.  </p>",
