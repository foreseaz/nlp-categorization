Re-uniting All the coding languages till date.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">A Powerful Skill at Your Fingertips</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn Go (lang) Programming,</strong> language is a fundamental &amp; flexible programming language that is powerful enough for experienced programmers to use, but simple enough for beginners as well. python is a well developed stable &amp; fun to use programming language that is adaptable for both small &amp; large development projects, if you want to learn how to prog or want to branch out into other programming language,</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Content and Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>Suitable for beginning programmers, through this course of 65 lectures &amp; 9 Hours of content, You'll learn all of the  fundamentals &amp; establish a strong understanding of the concept behind Go (lang) programming practice every day,putting your new learned skills into practical use immediately.</p><p><br></p><p>Go is an amazing choice for a language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax.</p>\n\n<p>Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today. I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">why did Google create a new language?</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent( Java). <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Go</strong> language is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, typed language with the efficiency and safety &amp; compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.”\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come learn about one of the greatest languages ever created. You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go.</p>",
