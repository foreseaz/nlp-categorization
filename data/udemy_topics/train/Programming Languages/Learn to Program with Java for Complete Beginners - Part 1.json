The course begins with definitions of basic terminology as well as the typical &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program.  You will learn about basic Java data types next so that you can declare and use variables in your programs.  From there, you will learn to read information from the user and output information to the screen.  Finally, you will learn to create and evaluate expressions using arithmetic, relational and logical operators.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you are an experienced programmer who wants to learn Java, please see our <strong style=\"\">Introduction to Java Programming</strong> course, instead.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Hands On Learning</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              Unlike other online training courses, you are encouraged to actively participate in the learning experience by running example files during lectures and performing coding challenges during labs.
