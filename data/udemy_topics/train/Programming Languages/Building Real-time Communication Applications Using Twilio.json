You will learn to use tools that interact with users beyond the browser for a range of important use cases.</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t We will start by looking at the tools and services that Pusher and Twilio offer getting to grips with their web interfaces, debug console, and provisioning tools. Mid-way through the tutorial, weâ€™ll look at building useful real-time and communication-based applications and learn how to build applications that can leverage the power of both Twilio and Pusher combined. Then, we will move on to building telephone verification systems with the help of 2-factor authentication tools. Before we reach the end of this course, we will develop innovative IVR systems to guide users through a telephone menu system, and update other users with their progress in real time. Finally, we will create telephone conferencing tools, voicemail services, and automated call-back request systems.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t With this course, you will be able to verify your users, deal with their requests, and update them to progress and activities in real time, and much more.  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Michael Peacock </strong>is an experienced software developer and team lead, from Newcastle, UK, with a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Durham.
