Go is a language suitable for a wide variety of tasks, from <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">systems programming</em> to <em>writing web servers</em>. </p><p>In this course, we’ll learn the syntax of Go, but more importantly, how to “<strong>think in Go</strong>.” While many tasks can be performed in the same ways as they are done in other programming languages, there is usually a more streamlined solution offered by Go, and that’s what we’re here to learn. </p><p>I hope you join me for this exciting look into one of the most powerful and elegant languages there is!</p>",
