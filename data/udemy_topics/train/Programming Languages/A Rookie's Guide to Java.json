I often see courses claiming that you can \"Learn To Make Video Games (No Programming Needed!)\" But unfortunately if you want to make anything more advanced than flappy bird you'll need a programming language under your belt. Learning programming is fundamental to any career in the software industry, games or otherwise, and Java is a great starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is aimed at programmers looking to learn the basics of Java programming and assumes no prior knowledge. Java is the <strong>most widely used programming language</strong> currently so you cannot go wrong by getting to grips with it. It hold a heavy focus on the \"Object Orientated\" part of \"Object Orientated Programming\" and as such it is a subject that features heavily in this course. Being easy to learn and written in plain English, Java is a fantastic language to get started with. This course will start at the very basics and build up slowly to advanced topics. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I try to communicate with my students as much as possible! If you have a question I'm always available to ask! And I'll try my best to solve your problem; programming or otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I believe in quality over quantity, I try to keep my lectures short and concise so you can take it all in, and easily refer back to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in crisp 1080p, and each section comes with written material to recap what you've learned. This truly is one of the best ways to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Remember! All Udemy courses come with a 30 day refund if you're not satisfied with this quality content!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Take action today!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>(Preview videos are not available in HD and should not be used as a judgement of quality, only of content)</p>",
