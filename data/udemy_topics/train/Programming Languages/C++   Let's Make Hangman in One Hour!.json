Well in my lessons I have about an hour of content that will introduce you to C++ and take you from no experience to a programmer that will have basic knowledge of how certain functions work and making your own playable game that you can share with family and friends.  We&#039;ll be using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express and throughout the course you will you will learn about and script…  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p>  \t\t   ·Constants  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t   ·Vectors  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t   ·Random Function  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t   ·If Statements  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t   ·While Loops  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t   ·Basic ASCII Graphics  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t   I go along and build the application as I record so you can get see some common mistakes that are made and how I figure them out.  You&#039;ll get a basic knowledge of programming rules within the Microsoft Visual C++ framework.  I recommend this course if you are a beginner or have some programming knowledge and want to make a playable game with my guidance.  Hopefully I’ll see you in the lessons.  </p>",
