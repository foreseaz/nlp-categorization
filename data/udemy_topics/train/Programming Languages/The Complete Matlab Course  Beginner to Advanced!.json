    "description": "<p>              MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for \nwriting moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the \nmanipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to\n write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively\n complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively \nsimple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a \ngeneral-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is \nbeing used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences \nthrough all disciplines of engineering to finance and beyond, and it is \nheavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an \nindispensable skill in todayâ€™s job market.</p>",
