    "description": "<p>This course teaches you how to create desktop and web-based applications using Java Swing, Java&#039;s built-in user interface toolkit. Each tutorial is fairly self-contained; but we&#039;ll also build two complete applications step by step along the way, so you can choose either to work through the whole course or to dip in and out.</p>    <p>Among other things we&#039;ll look at nearly all Swing widgets, we&#039;ll take a look at JDBC for database access, the graphics API, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, serialization for saving data, the listener-event model and even basic animation.</p>    <p>When you finish the course, you&#039;ll be an advanced Swing developer, capable of creating complex and scalable Swing GUI applications.</p>  ",
