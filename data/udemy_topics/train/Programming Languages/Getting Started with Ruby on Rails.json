It takes you from basic material on the best practices that are embedded into the Rails framework, through to advanced material on developing real time applications with Rails.</p><p>The course contains screen casts and practical examples. We show you how to get coding right away using Nitrous - a cloud based development environment. So there is no need to spend time on the tedious business of installing tools on your own machine.</p><p>I am not a full-time teacher. My courses are informed by extensive real-world application development both in industry and academia. So I teach you what works in practice, and by following this course you will benefit from my 35 years' experience in a wide range of software engineering projects.</p>",
