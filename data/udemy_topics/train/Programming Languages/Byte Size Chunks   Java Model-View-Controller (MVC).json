It starts from zero, builds up the design, then gives plenty of real-world examples, but crisply and quickly.</li><li>The course is also <strong>quirky</strong>. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.</li></ul><p><strong>What's Covered:</strong></p><ul><li>The MVC Paradigm</li><li>Observer Design Pattern and event handling</li><li>Command Design Pattern and action objects</li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything - <strong>anything!</strong> - and we will always reply :-)</li></ul>",
