    "description": "<p><em>Update March 2016 - New lectures have been added for: <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">upgrading to version 4.2</strong> of the Rails framework, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">how to edit nested resources</strong>, and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">cleaning up notifications</strong>. I also added a guide for <strong>how to install the Ruby on Rails framework locally</strong> on Mac and PC.</em></p><p>+++++++</p><p>  \tWhat does it take to become a full stack web developer? Well, you need to know: <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">server side coding, database design, HTML, CSS, algorithm development, file manipulation, routing, API integration, and the list goes on and on</strong>. Trying to learn each of these topics individually can feel overwhelming and finding out how they are all connected cause most developers to quit before they even start.  </p>\n\n<p>  \tIt’s for these reasons why I wanted to create a unique course that will walk you step by step through every skill you will need to become a full stack web developer, and I do it by showing you how to build an actual production application. Starting completely from scratch I explain how to setup your environment, create the application, build in advanced features and finally deploy to the web!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Some of the key skills you will learn in the course are:</em>  </p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Rails scaffold generators<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use git repositories<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Building custom file uploaders and downloaders<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Database modeling and query generation<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Creating and handling form data for input into the database<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Setting up secure user logins<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Building a search engine for the app<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">HTML and CSS customization<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use the Rails console</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to deploy the application to a live website</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How the Model - View - Controller (MVC) framework works in action</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Object oriented programming (OOP)</strong></li>  \t<li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">And much more!</strong></li>  </ul>\n\n<p>  \tEach video in the course has a link where you can access the code that was created for that specific stage in the course, making it easy to follow along. After completing the course you will earn a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">certificate of completion for Comprehensive Ruby on Rails development</strong> and you will be ready to start building your own applications.  </p>",
