This is a course for <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">REAL BEGINNERS</strong>. We will introduce all the required programming skills from the ground up.<br></p>\n\n<p>Students will be exposed to all the stages in software development and develop problem-solving skills as well as learn the syntax of the C# language.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The challenges/applications are drawn from a variety of situations in the  <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">home</em>,<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">school</em> and  <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">workplace</em>. They address a wide spectrum of  interests including business, science, math,art,music, and <em>especially</em> <strong>ANIMATION and</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">GAMES ...(1/4 of the lectures)</strong>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My goal is not just to show you how to program, but to help you understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Not only do the videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but each time an important concept is taught, I offer you a challenge that is designed to help you really understand what you have just learned.</p>\n\n<p>You will go away and complete the challenge, and then come back and see the challenge answered and explained in detail in the video, allowing you to check your results!</p><p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
