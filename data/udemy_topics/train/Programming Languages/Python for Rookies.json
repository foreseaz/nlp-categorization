You can use Python on any operating system to build whatever you like, including but not limited to GUI Applications, Web Applications, and Console Applications.  </p>  <p>  \tI&#039;ll teach you how this seemingly strange language is actually quite simple. We cover the fundamentals to writing Python code from Syntax, Datatypes, Operators, and Looping. We&#039;ll even take a look into 3rd party package management!  </p>",
