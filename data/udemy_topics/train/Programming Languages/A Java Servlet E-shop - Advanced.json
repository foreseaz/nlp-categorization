The course is not meant to be a Java tutorial, and basic knowledge of java is desired. Having said that some java will be thought when we are covering Servlet. Throughout the course, we will be using <strong style=\"\">Apache </strong><strong style=\"\">Tomcat, </strong><strong style=\"\">MySql </strong>Server and <strong style=\"\">Eclipse </strong>IDE.  We will see how to set a <strong style=\"\">Connection Pool</strong> using <strong style=\"\">JNDI Initial Context.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        We will also create a basic<strong style=\"\"> Session Management</strong><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">(aka &quot;Shopping Cart&quot;), </strong>and much more.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Note: It would be nice if you can complete my course <em style=\"\">&quot;Java Servlet (e-shop)&quot;, </em>hosted on Udemy - However this is NOT a prerequisite.</strong>  </p>",
