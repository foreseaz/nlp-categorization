Python is super easy to learn but very powerful since it contains many possibilities.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is growing faster and faster everyday and it has surpassed many other languages over the years for a lot of reasons, which you will find out soon enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why take this course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course starts with explaining what programming really is? Have you ever wondered how things actually work in a program?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Teaches the foundation of GENERAL programming</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every student should have some foundations on what programming really is before learning any language, why? Because once you understand the core components of programming it will be a lot easier to learn any language and create better programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>New lectures added all the time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you like what you do, it reflects. This is not a job for me, so I wake up wanting to code and help my students. Basically you pay once, get the course forever and get extra values added all the time, you have to love that :)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.<strong> Fun place to be </strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love making my lectures fun and engaging, so no boring lectures here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>T</strong><strong>he support you get in this course in unmatched</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>have you ever joined a class and received very little support or none at all? Well that is not going to happen in this class, because I love helping my students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
