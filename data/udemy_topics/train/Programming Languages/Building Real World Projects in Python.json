The course offers you a unique approach of learning how to code by solving real world problems. Throughout the course we will be understanding how to identify and formulate the problems, what is the key to a great app, we will learn how to efficiently adopt the problem for the computer and the <strong style=\"\">most important </strong>that you will be writing a lot of code! The course is structured in a way that lectures are like labs where we study the material, do the quizzes, write programs and test them! The most important that you will be involved into work a lot in order to get the best experience!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Technical background</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tYou will understand how Python can be used to solve problems from different fields, including mathematics, cryptography, guess-n-check algorithms and more! You don&#039;t need to be familiar with concepts we will be solving, however the basic understanding of programming is needed, <strong style=\"\">only the basics</strong>, like variables, if statements, loops and functions.  </p>",
