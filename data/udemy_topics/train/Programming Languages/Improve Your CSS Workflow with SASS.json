All the other programming languages moved on without it a decade ago but CSS lacks the ability to improve it until the browsers lets us. </strong><strong style=\"\">SASS gives us that power, we can build upon what CSS started without having to change the way we work.</strong> </p><p style=\"\">The SASS will be compiling but the only time we&#039;ll know about it is when we get an error as soon as we try and save any of our mistakes. We can write CSS faster, stronger and simpler. If you&#039;re CSS process hasn&#039;t improved by at least 2hrs (the length of this course) in the next 30 days you can claim your money back!</p>",
