    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course will dive into the basic programming principles that the C++ language is built on. All programmers in the beginner and intermediate level should find this course useful and interesting.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course will primarily be made of lectures that show me typing code on screen while I walk my students through my thought process. I find this to be a great way to get ideas across to an individual as they will experience a visual of the process that goes on in a programmers mind.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course is made to be completed at your own pace, but could very well be completed within a month if studied by a motivated individual. I begin the course with the very basics, to where even the complete beginner at programming can understand the topics that we will be building upon. I then expand to intermediate and advanced topics that will push the individual to expand his or her knowledge on the subject. This will drive an individual to create unique, innovative applications that people and businesses everywhere, strive to acquire.  </p>",
