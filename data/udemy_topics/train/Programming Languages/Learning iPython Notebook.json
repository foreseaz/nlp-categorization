This course is designed for the absolute beginner, meaning no experience with Python or iPython Notebook is required.  </p>  <p>  \tYou will start by learning how to install Anaconda, then take a tour of iPython Notebook. From there, James will take you through two projects: creating a random password generator in Python and analyzing and visualizing stock ticker data. This video tutorial also teaches you how to present using iPython Notebook, including learning about the operations, functions, methods, and modules. Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of using iPython Notebook as a tool for programming in Python, and be able to perform data analyses in Python. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.  </p>",
