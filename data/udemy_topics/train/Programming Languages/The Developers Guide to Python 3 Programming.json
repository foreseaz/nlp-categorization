    "description": "<p>Python is growing in popularity as a favorite programming language because of its simple syntax, coding principles and even easier readability of the code. For newbie programmers, Python has proved to be a great and easy language to start coding in.</p>\n\n<p>Python is a simple, yet powerful programming language that offers high-level data structures and easy approach to object-oriented programming principles. The language allows developers to build complex websites, without any complex coding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is considered as an easy language to start coding in because of it doing away with complicated curly brackets, which can be found in other C-derived languages such as C++, JavaScript, etc. Instead of brackets, Python relies on indents to distinguish codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For someone who has just started programming, confusing brackets and remembering complicated coding principles can often be too much. This is where Python shines with its simpler coding practices. With the introduction of Python 3, coding has become even simpler using this language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, before we start getting into the nitty gritty of programming, we will first have to learn how to actually write codes in this language. This is where this Python 3 courses comes in. Transform yourself from a newbie to a professional coder in under 5 hours with this comprehensive course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn how to start writing codes and by the end of this course, you’ll be able to code your very own program using Python. This fundamentals beginner course will go over the basics in details with sample codes at every level to help you understand how the language works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tutorial will help you understand Python from the very beginning including basic concepts such as Functions, Conditions, Loops, Objects, Object-oriented programming principles, Classes, Package and Modules, Exceptions, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will also you use everything you have learned to create a functional program all coded in Python 3. This course is a perfect amalgamation of theory and practical knowledge to help you get started on your coding journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much packed in this in short course, what is stopping you from becoming the next famous programmer? Enroll now and let’s get started!</p>",
