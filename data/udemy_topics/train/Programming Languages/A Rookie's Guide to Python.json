I often see courses claiming that you can \"Learn To Make Video Games (No Programming Needed!)\" But unfortunately if you want to make anything more advanced than flappy bird you'll need a programming language under your belt. Learning programming is <strong>fundamental </strong>to any career in the software industry, games or otherwise, and Python is a <strong>great starting point.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This course is aimed at programmers looking to learn the basics of Python programming and assumes <strong>no prior knowledge</strong>. Python is an incredibly easy language to pick up on, it is written in straightforward English and is colour coded for maximum usability. Despite that it is <strong>powerful!</strong> Fully fledged programs are built running it. Companies using it to run their technologies include Google, Yahoo, CERN and NASA!</p>\n\n<p>I try to <strong>communicate </strong>with my students as much as possible! If you have a question I'm always available to <strong>ask!</strong> And I'll try my best to solve your problem; programming or otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>I believe in <strong>quality </strong>over quantity, I try to keep my lectures<strong> short and concise</strong> so you can take it all in, and easily refer back to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in<strong> crisp 1080p</strong>, and each section comes with written material to recap what you've learned. This truly is one of the best ways to learn.</p>\n\n<p>Remember! All Udemy courses come with a <strong>30 day refund </strong>if you're not satisfied with this quality content!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take action today! </strong></p>\n\n<p>(Preview videos are not available in HD and should not be used as a judgement of quality, only of content)<br></p>",
