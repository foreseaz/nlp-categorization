It is intended to follow on from Part 1, and dovetails nicely into that flow. In particular, by following this course you will:</p><ul><li>Understand Scala's composition and inheritance features</li><li>Create abstract classes and pure abstract members (methods and fields)</li><li>Override and overload methods</li><li>Create primary and auxiliary constructors</li><li>Call superclass constructors and methods</li><li>Understand and use parametric fields</li><li>Create factory methods in companion objects</li><li>Construct simple DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)</li><li>Understand top and bottom types and how Scala uses them</li><li>Write correct equals and hashCode methods</li><li>Use traits to mix behavior into classes</li><li>Know the different styles of packages and visibility modifiers</li><li>Be able to import anything from anywhere</li><li>Write pre-conditions and post-conditions</li><li>Test your code with unit testing</li>\n</ul><p><br></p>",
