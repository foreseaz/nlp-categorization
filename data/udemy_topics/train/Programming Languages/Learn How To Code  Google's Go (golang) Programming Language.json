    "description": "<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</p>\n<p>Go is an amazing choice for a language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax. </p>\n<p>Go was created by luminaries in computer science at one of the best, if not the very best, software engineering firm to have ever existed - Google.</p>\n<p>The credentials of Go are unsurpassed.</p>\n<p>But why did Google create a new language?</p>\n<p>In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.” </p>\n<p>In my opinion, Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today. I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used. </p>\n<p>Come learn about one of the greatest languages ever created. You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go.</p>",
