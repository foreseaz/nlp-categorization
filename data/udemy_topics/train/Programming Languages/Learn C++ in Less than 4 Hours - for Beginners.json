C++ is based on C, but extends the language with features such as function templates, namespaces, and (of course) classes. We&#039;ll spend a lot of time in the first hour of the course talking about streams, which simplify input and output a great deal.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Here&#039;s a list of what you&#039;ll learn:</strong></p><p>- Primitive data types and variables</p><p>- How to create and use namespaces</p><p>- Basic I/O in C++ using streams</p><p>- Using stringstreams: input and output directly from strings</p><p>- File input and output using streams</p><p>- Functions: how they&#039;re like C functions, and how they differ</p><p>- Function templates - a look at writing generic code</p><p>- Classes and objects</p><p>- Constructors and destructors</p><p>- Inheritance (Single and Multiple)</p><p>- The idea of friend class members. </p><p>If you&#039;ve been thinking about learning C++, then this course is a good first step. </p>",
