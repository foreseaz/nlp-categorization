This course is designed for users that are familiar with C#, although no experience with Xamarin Mono is required.    You will start by learning about the cross platform development options and the basics of Xamarin Mono, including the development environment and Xamarin Studio. From there, expert Keith Welch will teach you about the various layouts and controls, including stack layout, content and scroll view, and label and entry. This video tutorial also covers basic user interface elements, as well as more advanced controls, such as table views, list views, maps, and web views. You will also learn about page types, tabs and grids, and local and remote data. Finally, you will learn about device features, including the camera, photo gallery, messaging, and phone.     Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of using the Xamarin framework to create code that will work in both iOS and Android. ",
