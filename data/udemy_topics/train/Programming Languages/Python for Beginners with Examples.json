    "description": "<p>This Python course will get you up and running with Python very quickly saving you time spent googling for video tutorials, exercises and examples. The course includes them all.</p>\n\n<p>The course is ideal for those who haven't programmed before, but it should also work for experienced programmers who want to learn Python as long as they don't get offended by a bit of extra explanations.</p>\n\n<p>You will start from scratch and by the end of the course you will know how to write Python programs and you will build your first Python program that has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python Tkinter. The Python program you will build can run both on Windows and Mac as a standalone program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course also guides you on how to go about building more advanced programs with Python. You will learn how to use Python third party libraries for building programs in a wide range of application areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just a tutorial. The content of the course consists of a mix of video lectures, quizzes, exercises, and discussions with the instructor and the fellow students.</p>",
