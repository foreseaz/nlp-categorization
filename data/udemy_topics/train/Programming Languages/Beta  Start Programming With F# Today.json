    "description": "<p>This course aimed at <strong>people with little or no skill in programming</strong>, no prior skills are required all. You just need a computer with Linux, OSX or Windows and an internet connection.</p><p>This course is about <strong>introducing you to programming</strong> <strong>in F#</strong>. We’ll complete an F# project together and generate procedural images in code, while learning <strong>functional programming principles.</strong> We will walk you through and explain every line of code and point out all the important programming concept as we progress.\n</p><div>F# is a mature, functional-first language especially well suited to computer science, machine learning, distributed computing and web applications too. There really is no limit to what F# can do for you!\n<p>We’ve structured the course to make learning all the material as easy and accessible as possible. We’ll challenge you to complete an F# programming task in every video to make sure you’ve got a great grip on all the concepts. But don’t worry, because after every challenge, we’ll also walk you through a solution line by line.\n</p><p>We have structured the course to enable anyone, no matter their background or experience, to get up and running with F#.</p><p>If you want to program with a language that has computer science at its heart and want to future proof your learning then this course is for you. </p></div>",
