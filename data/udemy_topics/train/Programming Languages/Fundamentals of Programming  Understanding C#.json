C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. The many innovations in C# enable rapid application development while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What is this course all about?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          This course is designed for people with NO prior programming experience. You will learn how to write computer programs using Microsoft Visual C#. The topics in this course are handpicked to build a strong foundation for all new programmers.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What makes this course better than the others?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          This course is better than others due to the design of the lectures. Complex topics are explained in a way that anyone can understand. The instructor began as a self-taught programmer, and knows where new programmers make mistakes and get confused. All the topics in this course have the instructorâ€™s personal tips and tricks that helped him to succeed.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Where should I go after I complete this course?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          This course provides a foundation that allows you to continue your programming education in almost any area. You can stick with desktop development and learn how to build rich and immersive applications using technologies like WPF. You can enter the world of mobile development to build Android, iOS, and Windows applications using Xamarin with C#. If game development is your area of interest, you can build both desktop and mobile games using Unity with C#. If you are tired of software development, web development is also an option using ASP.NET.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Can I take the experience from this course to learn new programming languages?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          Yes you can! C# is a &quot;C&quot; based programming language. All programming languages in the same family are extremely similar and easy to learn after learning C#. Some examples of &quot;C&quot; based languages are:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">C</li>  \t<li style=\"\">C++</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Java</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Objective-C</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Perl</li>  \t<li style=\"\">PHP</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Python</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Future courses from this instructor.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          Stay tuned for future courses in:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Advanced C#</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Building Real World Application using C#</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Microsoft Certification in C#</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Xamarin iOS</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Xamarin Android</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Android Development using Java</li>  \t<li style=\"\">WPF</li>  \t<li style=\"\">WCF</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Data Structures and Algorithms</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Fundamentals of Java</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Fundamentals of C++</li>  </ul>",
