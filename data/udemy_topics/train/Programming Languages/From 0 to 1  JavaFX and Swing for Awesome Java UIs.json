The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.</li></ul><p><strong>What's Covered:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>JavaFX</strong>: JavaFX as the evolutionary successor of Swing; Javascript and CSS support; FXML and SceneBuilder; how FXML and Dependency Injection work; zippy synching with Properties and Bindings; 3D Animations; 2D Animations (Transitions and Timelines); Charting - for the first time in Java; Media support, and building a real Media Player; Image handling and animated GIF construction; multi-threading in JavaFX; plus all the standard stuff: menus, trees, browser controls;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Swing</strong>: Framework basics; JFrames, JPanels and JComponents; Menus and menu handling; Trees and their nuances; File choosers, buttons, browser controls</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Design:</strong> The MVC Paradigm, Observer and Command Design Patterns; Dependency Injection via FXML</li></ul><p><strong>Programming Drills<em> (code-alongs, with source code included)</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>A News Curation app</strong> to summarise newspaper articles into a concise email snippet</li><li><strong>Animated GIF</strong> generation, using Java Image libraries as well multi-threading support</li><li><strong>A fully fledged Media Player</strong> to play MP3 and MP4 files; complex wiring up of UI elements to make sure the little details (volume control, position sliders) work right</li><li><strong>2D Animations</strong> to rival those available in Powerpoint and other presentation software</li><li><strong>3D Animations</strong> including moving cameras, rotation and transition of 3D shapes </li><li><strong>Bubble Charts and Tables</strong> to represent revenue, market valuation and growth of a set of companies - a business app as good as Excel</li><li><strong>Javascript and CSS</strong> examples that show how these incredibly powerful tools can be used inside a Java UI app</li><li><strong>SceneBuilder and FXML</strong> support, so that design and implementation can be divvied up between designers and software engineers</li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything - anything! - and we will <strong>always</strong> reply :-)</li></ul>",
