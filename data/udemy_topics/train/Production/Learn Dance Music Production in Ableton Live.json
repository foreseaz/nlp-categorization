    "description": "<p>  \t           My name is Henrique Caiano (aka Remotion), I’m a <strong>DJ</strong> and <strong>Music Producer</strong> based in Portugal. I’ve been <strong>making music for 7 years</strong> and after a lot of hard work I managed to release more than<strong> 100 tracks</strong>, had <strong>massive support from the biggest djs</strong> in the industry, my tracks reached <strong>Beatport’s top 100</strong> many times and successfully launched my very <strong>own record label</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       Throughout the next lectures I’m going to show you how to create a beautifully structured and powerful track, capable of reaching the top charts.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t           On these series of lectures, I’m going to teach you step by step instructions on <strong>how to create a floor shattering track</strong>. By using my own techniques that I gathered through the years, you will learn how to create the <strong>perfect drum layer</strong>, you’ll learn how to apply the <strong>best sampling tricks</strong>, <strong>how to arrange your track</strong> the proper way, and finally you’ll learn <strong>how to mix and master</strong> your track so it sounds great, be it on your computer speakers, as well as on huge festival sound systems.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t           As a bonus, you will have an <strong>unlimited email line</strong> where you are free to ask as many questions as you like as well as the <strong>entire project files</strong> so you can play and learn with it, as much as you want.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Send me your finished tracks and I'll be happy to give you a detailed feedback.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   </p>\n\n<p>  \t   </p>\n\n<p>  \t   </p>",
