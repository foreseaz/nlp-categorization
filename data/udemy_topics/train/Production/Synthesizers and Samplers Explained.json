    "description": "<p>Musicians, Producers, Audio Engineers, Beat Makers, and Artists: Odds are you have used a sampler and a synthesizer already.  These instruments do amazing things, but do you truly understand what you are doing when you turn those knobs and push those buttons?  Or are you just trying stuff until it sounds cool?  </p><p>I can help you take the guess work out of that, as well as improve your workflow when making music.  Whether you use hardware instruments or plug-ins, these controls and concepts are universal to every synthesizer and sampler.  If you are creating using music software such as FL Studio, Logic, Pro Tools, Reason, Nuendo, Cubase, MPC Renaissance, etc., it doesn't matter.  Again, these concepts are universal.</p><p>This short course (less than 30 lectures, all less than 20 mins) will dig in to how synthesizers and samplers create and manipulate sound.  I will show you how to create a custom synth patch from scratch and how to create your own sampler instruments, as well as some basic MIDI sequencing and editing.</p>",
