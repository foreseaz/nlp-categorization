Using 100% high-definition screencasts, you will learn the ins and outs of this software. It is the free (lite) version of my full course on Massive.  </p>  <p>  \t I created this course because learning the principles of true sound design opened up a <strong style=\"\">world of possibilities</strong> for my productions. Massive helped get me there. Now I want to show you how to get there too.  </p>  <p>  \t You know that you&#039;re sick of being a preset-picker. Learn sound design and get over that production plateau that has been making you hate your mediocre mixes.  </p>  <p>  \t You will become a <strong style=\"\">master</strong> of Massive.  </p>",
