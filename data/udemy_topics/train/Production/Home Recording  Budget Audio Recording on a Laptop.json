    "description": "<p>For years I&#039;ve been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe Audio Recording can be learned by anyone, and cost shouldn&#039;t be a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I&#039;ve used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p><strong style=\"\">This is a segment of Ultimate Ableton Live, Part 2: Recording and Warping.</strong></p><p>In this segment I&#039;ll be focusing on how to record on a budget, on a laptop. This class will be taught using Ableton Live, but if you use another piece of software as your main tool (Pro Tools, GarageBand, Cubase, etc.) you will be just fine. The concepts here are universal, and can be applied to any audio software.</p><p>If you like this course, please consider signing up for some of my other Ultimate Ableton Live courses! And of course, once you sign up for Part 1 - The Interface and The Basics, you automatically get huge discounts to all the upcoming parts (the next 5!) of this class.</p><p><strong style=\"\">You will not have another opportunity to learn Ableton Live in a more comprehensive way that this. Start here.</strong></p><p><em style=\"\">J. Anthony Allen is an Ableton Certified Trainer, and a PhD in Music Composition and master of Electronic Sounds. His music has been heard internationally in film, radio, video games, and industrial sound, as well as the concert hall and theater.</em></p><p><em style=\"\">He currently as an adjunct professor of composition at the University of St. Thomas, Macphail Academy of Music, and the CEO of Slam Academy in Minneapolis.</em></p><p><em style=\"\">Praise for other classes by J. Anthony Allen:</em></p><ul style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><li><em style=\"\">&quot;Dr Allen does it again with his music theory for electronic musicians series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn&#039;t aware of.&quot;<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></em></li><em style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><li>&quot;The Best Teacher ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all mean without giving what you don&#039;t want to know.&quot;<br style=\"\"></li><li>&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;</li></em></em></em></em></ul>",
