Starting with basic magnetic theory &ndash; which is key to understanding concepts like dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio &ndash; this course will use clear animations to simplify complex technical concepts including test tapes, bias, azimuth, and audio tape recorder modes and controls. The course includes step-by-step tape machine alignment instructions that can be applied to many brands and kinds of machines.  </p>",
