    "description": "<p>  \t    This start-to-finish guide will take you step by step into the process of conceiving, writing, scheduling, recording, producing, and promoting your record. Cheryl keeps it real, tells it to you straight, and uses a no-nonsense, slow and steady approach to covering every nook and cranny of making your own CD, all in under 1.5 hours of video lectures and with two super duper valuable reference PDFs.  </p>  <p>  \t  Examples, links, and actionable items will keep you motivated and headed in the right direction. <br>  \t<br>  \t  Topics covered include: choosing songs, booking musicians, raising money, scheduling with the studio, recording instruments and vocals, working in the mix, mastering, production and pitching your record to licensing companies.  </p>  <p>  \t  • Take this course if you&#039;ve always thought you could make your own record but don&#039;t know where to start, how to do it, or if it was even possible to do on your own.  </p>  <p>  \t  • Take this course even if you have produced records in the past to see a new perspective and see where you can tighten up your process to save you time and money (and create a great product).  </p>  <p>  \t  • Take this course if you are helping other artists follow their dreams and become their hero.  </p>",
