    "description": "<p>For years I've been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe Ableton Live can be learned by anyone, and cost shouldn't be a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p><strong>In this class we are going to focus on using Ableton Live for DJing and Performing.</strong> I'm assuming that you already know your way around Ableton Live pretty well, and now you want to take your techniques to the stage. In this class I'll walk you through all the basics of using controllers, Audio Effect Racks, and some other tricks.</p><p>Also in the class I have a really special surprise. I've invited my friend James Patrick to show some of his techniques as well. <strong>James is a DJ that has toured the world, and is known internationally for his engaging performances. </strong>He is going to be IN this class, and has contributed several exclusive videos for this class.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>Audio Effect Racks</li><li>Using Effect Rack Presets</li><li>Building our own Effect Racks</li><li>Parallel Processing</li><li>Fade To Grey</li><li>Performance Racks</li><li>Controllers and Controllerism</li><li>MIDI Mapping</li><li>The Ableton Push Interface</li><li>The APC40 Interface</li><li>Follow Actions</li><li>Legato Mode</li><li>Launch Modes</li><li>Launching Clips in Performance</li><li>Effects Setup for Performance</li><li>The Crossfader</li><li>Mapping Controllers for Performance</li><li>...

It leaves you enough room to go explore. The classes go by quick, so you can be on your way at being proficient. What are you wait for!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Amazing - Seriously Loved It! I took all his courses and have to say I'm so happy! Learnt loads! Jason is an awesome teacher!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going through this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I like these courses because you can get up and running quickly without having to spend hours of time wading through TMI (too much information!). Jason hits the high points but shows you what you need to know. Thanks!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I've watched many other videos on scales and chords before, however, this one has been the best. I now understand minor scales and chords and even how to analyze songs. It really gave me the confidence to start producing music because I feel like I have some structure and guidelines to follow. AWESOME!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Clear and Informative - Jason has a clear uncluttered style (with the important dashes of humor) of presentation that is focused on the important key aspects of this course. Recommended for those starting out!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Dr. Allen does it again with his music theory series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section, and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn't aware of.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"The Best Teacher Ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all means without giving what you don't want to know.\"</em></li></ul>",
