    "description": "<p><strong>Soundgoodizer</strong> is a famous widely used effect plugin built-in on the Fruity Loops digital work station (daw) by Image Line.<br></p>  <p>  \t<strong>  Is usually used to enhance the sound</strong> of instruments/synths so that in other words it becomes mixed and mastered already and, as the name suggests, sounds better.  </p>  <p>  \t        Especially in the EDM genres is overused because of its simplicity or \"one knob style\" interface that saves you lot of time and does to the sound what you'd have to learn in ages in terms of mixing and mastering.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  Unfortunately there're no alternative plugins to date that nearly recreates the same effect made for Macintosh.  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  So what I did was to recreate that same effect using a small chain of plugins available for Mac.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<em>&gt;&gt; Channel strips for Logic and Ableton ready to use are included for download.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t    &gt;&gt; <em>The course has subtitles in english.  </em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em>&gt;&gt; Couple of plug-ins installed required, please check the course requirements.</em>  </p>",
