In this course I&#039;ll be showing you how to do what it takes to transform a well produced, yet cold, lifeless mix into a hit ready for the airwaves.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Mastering is not some dark, mysterious art, it&#039;s a learning process and takes experience and knowledge of the tools and techniques you have at your disposal.  There&#039;s no need for expensive gear and fancy hardware, everything you need is inside your computer.  </p>",
