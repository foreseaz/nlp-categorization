Right from the start, he covers why most youtube tutorials fail in teaching how to make professional music in that they ALL cover the same ultra-basic method of starting with the kick drum, adding the snare, then the hi-hat. This is the musical equivalent of 'My name is -x- and I'm here to say'. If your foundation is bass/snare/hihat, then layer melody on top, you're never going to advance far. This is where Joseph stands out from the others. He gives you the insider knowledge gleaned from years of production that will give you the edge you're looking for. The best part of this course:You learn a solid understanding in the fundamentals of music theory. This ALONE (with practice) will give you the edge over other 'artists' who just randomly put notes together hoping to find a good sounding melody. Joseph gives you really valuable tips on how to build a song and even more important, you get to look over his shoulder while he creates a beat in real time. This course doesn't teach you how to use any software because you can use what he teaches in any production environment you may have, and honestly, with what I learned here, I can tell you it would only take away from the course. I only hope he creates a course on how to sequence drums because that last beat he drops...****! I wanna know how to do that!\"</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"I've been making beats for a long time and bought this course on sale just to see what it was about. I'm glad I did because I learned a few great things in here that I never knew about. The section about the chords was awesome! I got the most value from this section. The instructor definitely knows what he's talking about and shows in his beat making demonstrations. He has awesome piano and beat making skills! Anyone that can make beats from just a keyboard workstation has serious skills. I like the part about how music is spiritual and is something you feel, that resonated with me. This course is re-commended for beginners looking to take their beats to the next level. If you apply the lessons learned in this course you definitely will!\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"I think the course is Fantastic because he actually builds beats on the spot and they are.....FIRE!!!....The rhythms of today. I loved the course and will look to take all the courses you offer.\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>See you on the other side! :)<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>- Please note that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">this is a course for beginners</strong>. It is designed to help you take your beats to the next level if you are just getting started or have just a little experience under your belt. It would be best to not to enroll if you are a seasoned producer who makes music full time. <br></p>",
