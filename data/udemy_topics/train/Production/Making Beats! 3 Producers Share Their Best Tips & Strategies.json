    "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to Making Beats - 3 Producers Share Their Best Secrets!</strong></p><p>This class is unlike any class I've done before: It is a fully collaborative class. That means you are not just going to be hearing about how I make beats, and my production tips and secrets. You will hear those, but you will also hear from two other well-known producers to show you some of <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">their</strong> tricks as well. This is an art, and the best way to develop your own style is to hear the perspectives of several teachers - not just one.<br></p><p>For years I've been teaching Ableton Live in the college classroom. These classes I'm making for Udemy use the same syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost. I believe anyone can learn Ableton - and cost shouldn't be a barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I was named as a semi-finalist for the Grammy Foundation's Music Educator of the Year award because of my in-person university classes. Now I'm taking those classes to Udemy in an online format in order to reach more students, and give them the joy of Music Theory.</p>\n\n<p>In this class, we will cover:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Drum Racks</li><li>Recording Drum Racks</li><li>Making Your Own Drum Racks</li><li>Monitoring the Kick in Alternative Channels</li><li>Working on the Triplet Grid for Better Grooves</li><li>Playing Beats with Controllers</li><li>Setting up Controllers</li><li>MIDI Mapping</li><li>The Push Interface</li><li>Effect Racks</li><li>Building Audio Effect Racks</li><li>The Operator Synthesizer</li><li>Creating Ghost Notes</li><li>Velocity Adjustment Tricks</li><li>The Groove Pool</li><li>Quantizing Tricks</li><li>Effect Automation</li><li>...and much, much more!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">And of course, once you sign up for Making Beats - 3 Producers Share Their Best Secrets, you automatically get huge discounts to all the upcoming parts of this class.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You will not have another opportunity to learn Beat Making in a more comprehensive way than this.

It leaves you enough room to go explore. The classes go by quick, so you can be on your way at being proficient. What are you wait for!\"<br></em></li><li><em>\"Amazing - Seriously Loved It! I took all his courses and have to say I'm so happy! Learnt loads! Jason is an awesome teacher!\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going through this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"I like these courses because you can get up and running quickly without having to spend hours of time wading through TMI (too much information!). Jason hits the high points but shows you what you need to know. Thanks!\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"I've watched many other videos on scales and chords before, however, this one has been the best. I now understand minor scales and chords and even how to analyze songs. It really gave me the confidence to start producing music because I feel like I have some structure and guidelines to follow. AWESOME!\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"Clear and Informative - Jason has a clear uncluttered style (with the important dashes of humor) of presentation that is focused on the important key aspects of this course. Recommended for those starting out!\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"Dr. Allen does it again with his music theory series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section, and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn't aware of.\"\n\n</em></li><li><em>\"The Best Teacher Ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all means without giving what you don't want to know.\"</em></li></ul>",
