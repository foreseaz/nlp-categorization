    "description": "<p>  \t    You should take this if you&#039;ve ever wondered how groups like Daft Punk get their sound.  Or, if you just want a crash course in music production, so you can tell people you produce dance music, this would be the course to take.  </p>  <p>  \t          In an hour, you&#039;ll learn how to go from having little to no musical experience to mixing and producing a dance track with vocals (using a <strong style=\"\">vocoder</strong>, that alien-like voice synth) AND you&#039;ll be able to take these tools to create your own music.  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You don&#039;t even need instruments</em>--just three things:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>A computer keyboard</li>  \t<li>A built in mic on your smartphone or computer</li>  \t<li>A free copy of Ableton Live (download a 30-day trial on their website)</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t          I&#039;ll show you a trick for getting right to producing without playing a single note.  You don&#039;t need to be a genius or talented -it&#039;s all there for you.  </p>  <p>  \t          NOTE: The trial of Ableton lasts only 30 days, so make sure you finish this course quick so you can get started on new songs!  </p>  <p>  \t        After this crash course, it should be easy enough for you to move beyond the song I teach you into new songs, including doing your own remixes and covers of any music.  </p>",
