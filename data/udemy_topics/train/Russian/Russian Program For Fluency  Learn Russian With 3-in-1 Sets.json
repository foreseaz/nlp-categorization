    "description": "<p>Some people take years to master fluent Russian. You need to do more than just 'collect' knowledge - you need to develop your skills so you can use Russian grammar rules and vocabulary without thinking. The aim of this course is to effortlessly teach you fluent, automatic Russian.<br><strong>Speak Russian Fluently and Effortlessly Using the Learning To Know Russian System</strong></p><ul><li><strong></strong>Develop fluency in spoken Russian</li><li>Destroy your language barrier and fear of speaking</li><li>Improve your understanding and pronunciation</li><li>Find out about real life in Russia with fascinating Travellers' Notes</li></ul><p><strong>Become A Confident, Fluent Russian Speaker With Highly Efficient 3-in-1 Lesson Sets</strong></p><p>Speaking fluently, stress-free, without hesitation is the dream of any language learner. But many students end up collecting knowledge: grammar, words, phonetics – but not speaking fluent Russian. That's why this course uses techniques that <strong>develop the skill of fluent speaking, train your brain and vocal apparatus</strong> so you can process and pronounce Russian speech.</p><p>The Learning to Know Russian system teaches you to easily and effectively start speaking Russian. The system was created over 5 years by a team of learning professionals, managed by Denis P. Ivanov. </p><p>In the course, apart from getting a look into real life in Russia, the 3-in-1 lesson sets are all based on highly-effective, proven teaching technologies that will take your Russian to fluency.</p><p>This course includes 30 video lessons that last a total of 4 hours. First and foremost, the course is designed for beginner to intermediate level students, but it can also be of help to those who struggle with speaking and comprehension.</p><p><strong>The course is structured around the unique Learning to Know Russian system</strong>. Each of the 10 lesson sets consists of 3 lessons and 3 steps to fluency.</p><p>The first step of each lesson set will have you listening to <strong>understand Russian words</strong> in a situation that makes sense – this is the Context Lesson</p><p>Then you will listen, read and pronounce to <strong>prepare your vocal apparatus for speaking</strong> and your brain for listening comprehension – this is the Repetition Lesson.</p><p>Step three will have you <strong>breaking down your language barrier</strong> with simple question-and- answers stories. Conditioning yourself to answer these questions quickly makes up the Storytelling Lesson.</p><p>The course gives you a lot of flexibility to learn the way you want, but I recommend you aim for <strong>deep immersion - </strong><strong>studying 50 hours and more</strong>. You'll get the most value from the course when you go for the intensive option.</p><p>You will be able to <strong>download the lessons in MP3 and PDF format</strong> so you can study on the go.</p><p>As a nice extra, the course also includes 10 topics on life in Russia – all of which are interesting and helpful to those planning on travelling to Russia. </p><p>Once you finish the course, you will <strong>be confident when speaking</strong>, you will have seriously improved your conversational Russian. Your listening comprehension will also be vastly improved and, most likely, you will have a completely <strong>new outlook on language learning and your linguistic abilities!</strong></p>",
