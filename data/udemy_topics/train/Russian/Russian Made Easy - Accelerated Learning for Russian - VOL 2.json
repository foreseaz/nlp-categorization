    "description": "<p>  \t Volume II  of &#039;Russian Made Easy&#039; picks up where Volume 1 left off. It continues to use modern techniques like <strong style=\"\">contextual learning</strong> for vocabulary acquisition, <strong style=\"\">construction branching </strong>for fluency, and<strong style=\"\"> pattern recognition </strong>for grammar. The &#039;Russian Made Easy&#039; series teaches beginner&#039;s Russian in a fun, efficient style. With thirty episodes in all, each episode approximately 20 mins long, both volumes of the course could be finished in a week, but it&#039;s best to study only one episode per day.  </p>  <p>  \t This course is ideal for absolute beginners to Russian, as well as those with some experience but who just haven&#039;t been able to find the right course. Along with learning approximately 300 words and phrases, when you finish the course you&#039;ll also understand:  </p>  <p>  \t * All six Russian verb conjugations  </p>  <p>  \t * All six Russian cases  </p>  <p>  \t The course lays a rock-solid foundation for those who seek to master the Russian language.  </p>",
