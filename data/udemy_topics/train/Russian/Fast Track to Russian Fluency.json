    "description": "<p>  \tThe goal of <strong style=\"\">Fast Track to Russian Fluency</strong> is to turn you into a fluent speaker of Russian on the most common topics of conversation, including &quot;Friends &amp; Family&quot;, &quot;Work &amp; Travel&quot; and &quot;What You Did.&quot; In all, there is approximately <strong style=\"\">five hours of video </strong>here, to be consumed in short sessions.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course is structured around numerous, natural conversations between native speakers. Then, from the conversations the instructor will pull out the constructions and will guide you to fluency with each phrase. The SLT (super-literal translation) will be given for each line, and you&#039;ll learn how to create your own &quot;Construction Branches&quot; which are a key to developing fluency.  </p>  <p>  \tYou should take this course if you have some experience in Russian but aren&#039;t able to have fluent conversations yet.  </p>",
