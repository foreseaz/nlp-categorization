If this thought stirs you, you are at the right place!Think about self-driving cars, phones, washing machines or any device with built-in intelligence - what governs this intelligence? Microprocessors! When Intel introduced the Microprocessor commercially in 1971, its multiple uses and versatility were not foreseen. Today, the use of a processor is limited only by the engineer’s imagination.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t    Here’s a program that will kick-start your journey to becoming a good embedded systems engineer. We offer ‘Introduction to Microprocessors’ as the first in this series.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t    While you can learn about Microprocessors just about anywhere, we believe learning from an industry veteran will give you the preparation that is critical to succeed. Bhaskaran Srinivasan, a veteran of the embedded systems industry will be guiding you through this program.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t    Join us on this exciting journey as we explore how Microprocessors power smart machines. In the next few pages of the Learner’s Handbook, we will tell you more about the curriculum, duration, teaching methods and career options available to you after the completion of this program.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Learning Plan</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    You are expected to spend approximately 14 hours to go through the entire program.
