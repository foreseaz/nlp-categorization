It contains an introduction, tutorial, a number of \"how to\" guides, and then reference documentation for the components that make up the framework.</p>  <p><strong>Compatibility with standard hosting</strong></p>  <p>CodeIgniter 3 only needs PHP 5.2.4, and plays nicely with almost all shared or dedicated hosting platforms. Many webapps need a database, and CodeIgniter supports the most common, including MySQL.</p>  <p><strong>No restrictive coding rules</strong></p>  <p>Use your own coding and naming conventions, with only a few caveats that deal with classname conflicts. CodeIgniter looks to empower you, not shackle you.</p>  <p><strong>Simple solutions over complexity</strong></p>  <p>CodeIgniter encourages MVC, but does not force it on you.</p>  <p><strong>Exceptional performance</strong></p>  <p>CodeIgniter consistently outperforms most of its competitors.</p>  <p><strong>No large-scale monolithic libraries</strong></p>  <p>CodeIgniter is not trying to be all things to all people. It is a lean MVC framework, with enough capabilities to improve your productivity, while providing for third-party addons/plugins for additional functionality.</p>  <p><strong>Nearly zero configuration</strong></p>  <p>Much of the CodeIgniter configuration is done by convention, for instance putting models in a \"models\" folder. There are still a number of configuration options available, through scripts in the \"config\" folder.</p>  <p><strong>No need for template language</strong></p>  <p>CodeIgniter comes with a simple, substitution based, templating tool. Addons/plugins are available for most of the full-blown templating engines, if that is what you are used to.</p>  <p><strong>Spend more time away from the computer</strong></p>  <p>Don't we all want it? CodeIgniter is easy to learn and to get proficient with.</p><p>#Codeigniter #Codeigniter3 #Rapid application development</p><p>#BCIT #Basics #Background #MVC #PHP  #studyEasy #Easy Course</p><p>#Framework #Bootstarp #Performance #Websites</p><p><br></p>",
