The Management Information Systems course explains the benefits of computers to organisations, how the work of an organisation is affected by computers and how you can deploy and manage them to support your organisation’s goals and strategies.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Why Learn MIS?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t   Computers, in all forms, have become an integral part of our daily life. Some estimates say that by the end of 2015, there will be more Indians carrying smartphones in their pockets than there are Americans doing so! Computers may not appear essential for everyone but today, the lives of each and every person are affected—and often benefited – by their use and deployment. Governments, corporations and other organisations cannot operate efficiently and effectively without them. Some businesses, such as Amazon and Flipkart, run almost entirely on computer systems. In other cases, the use of computers by organisations, such as banks, ensure better services to customers.  </p>  <p>  \t  The Management Information Systems course will help you understand the benefits of computers to organisations and, more importantly, how to deploy and manage them to support an organisation’s goals and strategies. No matter which function of an organisation you work in—finance, marketing, human resources or production—you will need to understand how your work is affected by and how you may effectively deploy computer systems.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Learning Plan</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  You are expected to spend the following effort in completing this course:  </p>  <p>  \t  Activity                                         Time Spent (hrs.)  </p>  <p>  \t  Read Learner Handbook                      1  </p>  <p>  \t  Watch videos for all modules             20  </p>  <p>  \t  Self-Assessment Exercises                5  </p>  <p>  \t  Total                                                    26  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What Next?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course provided you an overview of the field of MIS.
