    "description": "<p>This course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate 70-461: &quot;Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012&quot;.</p><p>In Session 1, we learned all about dates, strings and number data types, and in Session 2 we constructed SELECT queries, JOINed multiple tables together and used DML commands, and in Session 3 we created views, constraints and triggers to encapsulate language and improve security.</p><p>We will further encapsulate our routines by creating procedures, allowing us to EXECUTE parameterised commands with just one statement, and we&#039;ll add some error handling with TRY, CATCH and THROW. </p><p>We&#039;ll also combine datasets together, by looking at UNION and UNION ALL, INTERSECT and EXCEPT, CASE, ISNULL and Coalesce, and the mighty MERGE statement. By doing this, we will complete objectives 11, 12, 13 and parts of 6 and 18 from the 70-461 exam.</p><p>No prior knowledge other than what we covered in Sessions 1 to 3 is required. However, prior experience with Excel or Access would be beneficial.</p><p>There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.</p><p>Once finished, you will know what how to write procedures, add error handling, and combine datasets together, and we&#039;ll have expanded on our current knowledge of T-SQL.</p>",
