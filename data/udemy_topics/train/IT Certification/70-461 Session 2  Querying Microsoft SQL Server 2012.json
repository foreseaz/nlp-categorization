    "description": "<p>This course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate 70-461: &quot;Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012&quot;.</p><p>Rather than present one huge course, this course takes some of the basics and then goes in depth.</p><p>In session 1 we learnt all about dates, strings and number data types and functions in some detail.</p><p>We&#039;ll create tables which use these, and then INSERT some data into them. Then we&#039;ll write queries which will retrieve and summary this data, using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY. </p><p>We&#039;ll then JOIN these tables together to find where we are missing data and where we have inconsistent data. We&#039;ll then UPDATE and DELETE data from the tables. This will allow up to fully complete objective number 1 from the 70-461 exam.</p><p>If this sounds too basic, then please look at my other sessions.</p><p>The only prior knowledge which is required for Session 2 is that which has been taught in Session 1.</p><p>There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.</p><p>Once finished, you will know what how to create tables, insert data and create analyses, and have an appreciation of how they can all be used in T-SQL. </p>",
