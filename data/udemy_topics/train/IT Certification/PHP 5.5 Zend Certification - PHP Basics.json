It is a certification that shows that the programmer knows the ins and outs of the PHP programming language. </p><p>This course is the first in a series of courses designed to cover the exam syllabus.  It focuses on the first of the three most important sections of the syllabus.</p><p>This course is designed for programmers with some programming experience (preferably in PHP) who want to prepare for their Zend Certified Engineer 5.5 exams.</p><p>Although this course has the word “basics” it’s not a beginners course and is not aimed at people who have no programming experience. It's more about the basics of PHP than it is about the basics of programming.</p><p>Programmers who have a good amount of experience in another language should be able to use this course to pick up the idiosyncrasies of the worlds most popular web programming language.</p><p>This course includes quiz questions and PDF notes drawn from my book.</p>",
