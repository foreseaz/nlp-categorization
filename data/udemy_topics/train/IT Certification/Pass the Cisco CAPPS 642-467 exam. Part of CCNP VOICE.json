We don&#039;t just talk about a topic. We demonstrate it using multiple phones communicating with CUCM or CUME or Unity Connection etc. Watch the calls be set up, transferred, torn down and so forth in real time.</span><br style=\"\">  </p>    <p>This video course allows me to explain and demonstrate concepts in far greater detail than would be possible in a 5 day course. There isn&#039;t enough time to explain all the concepts properly in a standard instructor lead course. However, here I am able to do that. I have even added some additional content from the CVOICE course to explain and demonstrate more advanced concepts.</p>    <p class=\"PIN_1373053954162_hazClick\">Why pay $3,695 for an instructor lead course (with some companies) when you can get all the content here for $47?</p>    <p>And watch as many times as you like, watch on your iPad and even download all the videos!</p>    <p><span><br style=\"\">  </span></p>  ",
