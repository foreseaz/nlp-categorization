Now it is time to not just learn a topic, but to understand them. This is where you need to stop using courses that just give you 5 minute videos on a Topic. I have seen Private Vlans taught in 8 minutes. How you can you call your self a CCNP with 8 minutes of training.</p><p>We go through topics in the way to make sure you can fish for a life time. If you take your studies seriously, then this is the course for you. If you are looking for handouts and 5 minute clips because you paid $10 for the course, you will be disappointed here. This course takes serious commitment over a period of time to complete.  </p><p>You will find this course giving you the power to watch, learn, and stand on your own two feet. How this possible, because of my mission. Others are here to make money for their courses. I am here to provide you the tools to be successful with understanding the technology. The By-Product is you being able to pass the exam, and become the Engineering that you deserve to be.</p><p>Be Determined!</p><p>Be Strong!</p><p>Be Cisco! </p>",
