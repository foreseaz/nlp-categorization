This course is designed for the beginner, meaning no experience with Oracle 12c is required.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  You will start by learning about the Oracle relational database, then jump into learning about the SQL SELECT statement. From there, author Steve Ries will teach you about conditionals in SQL, conversion functions, and implicit and explicit joins. This video tutorial also covers subqueries, data manipulation, and data definition language. Finally, you will learn about the exam, and Steve will provide you with hints and strategies to help you prepare.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Once you have completed the course, you will be fully capable of working with the SQL programming language, and in doing so, you will be much better prepared for the Oracle Database 12c SQL Fundamentals exam. Project files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.  </p>",
