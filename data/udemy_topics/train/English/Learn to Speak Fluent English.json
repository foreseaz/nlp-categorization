You&#039;ll learn how native speakers actually pronounce things, and you&#039;ll learn the special words and grammar that are unique to fluently spoken English.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course is structured around an audio story. Each chapter is then broken into sections, where we analyze and learn all the most common words and features of fluent English. In the Fluency Drills section, you&#039;ll practice everything you&#039;ve learned until you have it mastered.  By the end of the course, your English will be at a much higher level, both in understanding what native speakers say, and in your ability to speak with smooth, high-level English.  </p>",
