    "description": "<p>  \t Fluent Spoken English is its own language with its own vocabulary and grammar. In this course, you&#039;ll learn to Understand Fluent English. We do this by taking a close look at R.S.P.s, or &quot;Real Speech Patterns.&quot; These include the J Morph, the Ch morph, reductions, reduction groupings, and more. Remember, the focus in this course is on listening and understanding. It should take approximately two weeks to complete, if doing one lesson a day (as is recommended). If your goal is to finally understand fluent American speech -- whether in movies, at work, with friends and so on -- then this is the course for you!  </p>",
