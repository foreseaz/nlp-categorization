The first part of this is your pronunciation. Even the best words can sound bad because of a bad accent.</p><p style=\"\">This course will teach you from the smallest parts of pronunciation to the biggest parts and help you train your accent each step of the way.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">This course will take you over 3 hours to complete but remember that an accent takes time and training to change, so it is suggested that you do only one section per week and train every day. The recommended time is approximately 13 weeks to complete the course.</p><p style=\"\">This course is for anyone who wants to understand how English pronunciation works and change their accent.</p>  ",
