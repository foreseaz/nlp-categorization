    "description": "<p>Do you find it difficult to really hear the difference between certain sounds in English?</p>\n\n<p>For example, what is the difference between Sheep and Ship?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many students of English have difficulty with vowel sounds in English because they often don't exist in other languages and this can lead to serious problems in their communication.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we look at the twenty <strong>vowel</strong> sounds in English, how they <strong>sound</strong>, and how they are usually <strong>spelt</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We then practise the sounds together.<br></p>\n\n<p>Also included are audio files of the lessons themselves, and some practice sentences that include lots of words with the sounds from each lesson. You can download these and practice them at home, in the car or wherever you like!</p>\n\n<p>This course is split into 10 lessons and we look at two sounds in each lesson. By the end of the course you will have covered every vowel sound in English. You will also gain familiarity with the transcription alphabet, which you can then read in dictionaries and understand exactly how the word is pronounced. </p><p>This course is ideal for anyone who wants to improve their accent, particularly if they want a British English accent.</p>",
