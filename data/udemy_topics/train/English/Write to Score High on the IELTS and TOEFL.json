    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   Many students have to pass the IELTS or TOEFL Exams in order for them to continue their education in the country of their choice. The writing portion of these exams is difficult for many students. This class directly teaches students how to score high  in the elements of  task achievement and grammatical range and accuracy. These are 2 of the 5 areas students lose points in the most. This course also targets dozens of key vocabulary words needed in the areas of technology, education, global business and more. Not only are the words taught, but example sentences and collocations are modeled  so students learn to use these words correctly.</p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Students will look at example essays and how they are good and how they can be improved. Lectures have practice exercises for students to complete and they can ask the teacher any questions they  have. </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course takes about 1 week to complete and is structured into three parts REVIEW and PRACTICE of key grammatical issues, VOCABULARY development and APPLICATION of these in writing. </p>",
