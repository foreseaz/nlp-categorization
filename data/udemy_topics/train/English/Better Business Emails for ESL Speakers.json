Whether you're looking for work or in work already, being able to write professional sounding business emails separates you from the rest.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Course Content</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              There are 15 original lectures (and bonus lectures added when I have time), quizzes, and exercises you can download to practice what you watch. I am also very happy to help any students who are having trouble understanding the ideas. The course is split up into sections as follows:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Section 1: Introduction to Better Business Emails</li>  \t<li>Section 2: Start (and finish) as you mean to go on.</li>  \t<li>Section 3: The main body.</li>  \t<li>Section 4: Getting your English right.</li>  \t<li>Section 5: Finishing your emails.</li>  \t<li>Section 6: Rounding everything off.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Learning Objectives</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              At the end of the course you will be able to:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>write great subject lines.</li>  \t<li>know what openings to use.</li>  \t<li>create concise emails that are easy to write.</li>  \t<li> use the correct closing phrases.</li>  \t<li>look for problems when proofreading</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Who should take this course?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>Please do not enroll if you only have a basic knowledge of English. If you don't understand this description, you will not understand the lectures.  </p>  <p>  \t                        This is a course for ESL speakers with intermediate to upper-intermediate English (CEF â€“ A2 to B2). If you are at an advanced level (C1 to C2), but you have trouble with emails, you will find this useful too.  </p>  <p>  \t                            Secondly, this is a general course giving you tips and strategies to help you improve your business emails. These might be asking for information, writing to a client, or answering an email from your boss. Also, you will not get lots of sample emails in this course, but you do get lots of quizzes and exercises to help you practice what I teach.  </p>  <p>  \t        Go to the top of the page and enroll today; you could be taking your first step towards a better job and/or more money. </p>",
