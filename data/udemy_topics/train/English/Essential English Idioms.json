    "description": "<p>So, you’ve been studying English for years. You’ve reached a good level of communication, but you sometimes struggle to understand native speakers, and you still don’t sound natural when you speak. What can you do to reach the next level of fluency?</p><p>One way to improve your proficiency is to focus on <strong>idioms</strong> – phrases and expressions that all native speakers use but that are difficult for non-native speakers to understand.</p><p>But are they really that common? The quick answer is yes! According to research led by Howard R. Pollio of the University of Tennessee, <strong>native speakers use on average 4 idioms per minute when speaking</strong>. So, clearly, focusing on developing a mastery of English idioms will help you not only understand native speakers more easily, but also sound more <strong>natural</strong> and <strong>interesting</strong> when you speak. </p><p>Sure, there are many lists of idioms available online. But they don’t prioritize the most common, useful, or frequently used idioms, and they don’t provide enough example sentences to truly help you master these idioms.</p><p>In contrast, this course focuses only on essential idioms that can be used in a variety of day-to-day situations. A series of fun, informative, and detailed video lectures provide <strong>clear explanations</strong>, numerous <strong>example sentences</strong>, and a list of <strong>common phrases and structures</strong> using each idiom. </p><p>The videos themselves are presented by a friendly native English speaker and include related images for each example sentence. They will not only give you a clear understanding of the meaning of the idioms – they will also show you the key phrases and structures you need to use the idioms naturally. Furthermore, they will model how to pronounce the idioms in a natural manner, so that you can truly sound like a native!</p><p>In addition to all of that, Essential English Idioms comes with <strong>30 activity sheets</strong>, offering both <strong>writing and speaking activities</strong> to help you truly master each and every idiom on the list. There are also <strong>six review activity sheets</strong>, so that you can test yourself and track your progress.</p><p>Included in this package:</p><p><strong>44 </strong>video lectures (<strong>2 hours</strong> of video), covering a total of <strong>77</strong> frequently used English idioms.</p><ul><li><strong>30 <em>Essential English Idioms</em> videos</strong>, each containing:\n<ul><li>a clear definition</li></ul><ul><li>5+ example sentences</li><li>a list of common phrases and structures using the idiom, each with a further example sentence</li></ul><ul><li>a list of common phrases and structures using the idiom, each with a further example sentence</li></ul></li><li><strong>14 <em>Other Idioms with the Same Meaning</em> videos</strong>, covering:<ul><li>a further 47 frequently used idioms</li></ul><ul><li>2+ unique example sentences per additional idiom</li></ul></li><li><strong>30 activity sheets</strong>, including:<ul><li>comprehension questions that test your ability to recall the key vocabulary and grammar structures related to each Essential English Idiom</li></ul><ul><li>writing and speaking questions to help you use each Essential English Idiom in a natural way</li></ul><ul><li>writing and speaking questions to help you use each Other Idiom with the Same Meaning in a natural way</li><li>key notes from the video including the definition and common phrases and structures using the idiom</li></ul></li><li><strong>6 review activity sheets</strong>, including:\n<ul><li>ordering exercises</li></ul><ul><li>mix and match exercises</li></ul><ul><li>writing and speaking questions</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>So, what are you waiting for?</strong> <strong>Improve your English today with <em>Essential English Idioms</em>!</strong></p>",
