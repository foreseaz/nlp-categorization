    "description": "<p>This course covers all the concepts of Financial Statement Analysis and Financial Reporting. It covers 20% of the syllabus of CFA L1 and builds the foundation in Finance. The learnings from this course are not just useful for the candidates preparing for the CFA exam but also for those aspiring to enter the field of finance without formal education of commerce. </p><p>This course is formulated in various Study sessions and readings just as structured in the CFA program. I have made 73 video lectures for each subtopic taking into account that the attention span of students is short. Each topic is followed by concept checkers on that topic and I also explain how a question should be attempted on the CFA exam.</p><p>This is a tough subject and a student would take between 60-100 hours to get an understanding of FRA through self study, however, taking this online course, with help them understand this complex topic in less than 15 hours! Therefore taking this course is strongly recommended to working professionals preparing for CFA exam who have limited time available for studying.</p><p><br></p>",
