    "description": "<p><strong></strong><strong>Master English Pronunciation and Listening.</strong></p><p>Of course the two most important things when speaking English are:</p> <ul><li>1)Being understood by who you are talking to (pronunciation).</li> <li>2)Understanding the other person (listening skills).</li></ul> <p>However, these two areas are often <b>totally ignored</b> by English language teachers and are very difficult skills to master on your own. <b>The result?</b> Students of English are often totally lost when they have a <b>real life conversation</b> with someone who isn't either <i>speaking very clearly</i> or <i>slowing down what they are saying</i>. This means that the students are totally missing out on learning English naturally through real conversation.<b></b></p><p><b>So, why study pronunciation and listening skills together?</b></p><p>For years I have taught all sorts of students from different countries and backgrounds and have come across the same problem over and over again. Even if a student sounds good, if you actually listen, you will discover that their English is quite broken. In particular students often miss out smaller words such as 'a' and 'the' and the prepositions such as 'in', 'at' etc. When I ask them to pronounce these words, they give me the perfect 'classroom' pronunciation. The problem is that no one speaks like that <b>in real life</b>. So that's the problem; because they don't know the real life pronunciation they can't hear it in real conversations, and because they can't hear it, they can't get used to hearing it and start using it naturally. So as soon as I teach them the <b>real everyday pronunciation</b> they are able to <b>hear the words properly</b> and in turn are able to use them as well. It's like magic how quickly their pronunciation, listening skills and English usage improve when taught in this way.</p><p>This course will help you master this problem and many other intermediate issues such as intonation and easily confused words as well. We are constantly updating the course and are on hand to help you with any questions or issue you may have.</p><p>Benefits of the course:</p><p>1)Understand <i>the details</i> of what people are saying and not just <i>the general idea</i>.</p><p><span></span>2)Be able to speak to native/fluent English speakers without them having to repeat or slow down what they are saying.</p><p><span></span>3)Feel comfortable speaking to friends and work colleagues without constant misunderstandings.</p><p><span></span>4)Improve your pronunciation so others can understand you more easily. Avoid confusion and embarrassing situations.</p><p><span></span>5)Enjoy speaking in English more. The better you are understood (pronunciation), and the better you understand others (listening skills), the faster you will learn and the more fun you will have interacting with other English speakers.</p><p><span></span>6)If you are not <b>totally satisfied</b> with the course, you can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase. So it is totally <b>risk free</b> for you.</p> <p><b>What this course is:</b> Full of easy to understand explanations. Activity based; learn through actually doing. Every lesson has lots of opportunities for you to practice what you are learning. Designed to take you from 'intermediate classroom' usage to real life usage.</p><p><b>What this course isn't:</b> We don't just concentrate on pronouncing the same old sounds that other lower level courses do. We haven't included any jargon or strange 'pronunciation symbols'. So literally anyone can follow along and benefit immediately.</p><p><b>Bonus!:</b> For all our paying customers . Just send us a short recording of yourself speaking (it's easy to record on a mobile phone) and we will send you in-depth feedback on where you need to improve your pronunciation.</p><p><b>So get started right away.</b> The course is short enough so you can start seeing <b>real progress immediately</b> but detailed enough that you can keep going back and <b>improving more and more.</b></p>",
