    "description": "<p>  \t       Hello everyone!  Welcome to your English course.  </p><p>  \t     This class has been designed by a medical doctor!  The goal is to to help you improve your English speaking, listening, writing and reading skills. </p><p>  \t       Although this  curriculum was created for people who study or work in medical settings, it is broad enough that everyone who takes it will improve his or her English.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       You will learn English faster than in a traditional course because of the problem-based-learning method. This simply means that you learn from real-life situations. The great thing about the PBL method is that you can learn basic, intermediate, advanced and specialized English during the same course.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       This is a creative, non-traditional way of teaching.  Instead of simply giving  you information to memorize, I will guide you through problems using  written documents, listening exercises, conversations and questions.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t         It will be a lot of fun and you will notice an improvement after the first lesson.  </p>\n\n<p>Please note that two (optional) 45 minute Skype lessons are included free with this course.    All lessons are taught by a native English-speaking experienced physician!!!  </p><p>Part two will be published soon.<br></p>",
