Join me and others from around the world as we practice our English skills and get to know each other.

Let me put this experience to work for you.</p><p style=\"\">I concentrate on helping people prepare for tests such as the IELTS, TOEFL, and SAT. I also edit and proofread documents, websites, and university applications. As you might have guessed by now, I live and love the English language.</p><p style=\"\">And, yes, I know English can be difficult; but it is also beautiful, and it can give you so much pleasure.
