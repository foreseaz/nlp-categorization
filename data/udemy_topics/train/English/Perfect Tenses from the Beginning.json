These lectures do more than ask you to memorize rules, by discussing the reasons why we use these tenses and how they fit with other parts of grammar. <strong style=\"\">Purpose</strong> is the name of the game. </p><p>This course is meant for busy people who want to learn English but don&#039;t have enough time to dedicate hours with a textbook. None of the lectures are too long so you can understand what you need without wasting time with unnecessary details or pointless work. If you like, you can probably finish this course in around 1 hour, though sometimes repeating lectures might be necessary to fully understand a concept.</p><p>This course will help you become more <strong style=\"\">confident</strong> in English. Understanding how to use perfect tenses can break the habit of only using simple sentences and allow you to <strong style=\"\">express yourself</strong> much more clearly than before.</p><p>In conclusion, this course is what you need to level up your English and become a more confident learner!<span></span></p>",
