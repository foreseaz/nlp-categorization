    "description": "<p>  \tThe goal of this course is to teach you the common idioms and expressions used in everyday business English in America. In each section you&#039;ll hear a conversation between native speakers featuring five new expressions. In the next section, we&#039;ll examine each expression and teach you the meaning and how it&#039;s used. You&#039;ll learn similar (non-idiomatic) expressions, and get practice using these idioms in their place. Finally, in the Fluency Drills, you&#039;ll master each idiom by working with it in common constructions.  </p>  <p>  \tThis free course is only volume #1 out of four volumes. To complete the entire course will approximately one month, but to finish this free Volume #1 will take about one week.  </p>",
