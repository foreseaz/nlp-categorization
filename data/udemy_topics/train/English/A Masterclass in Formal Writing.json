    "description": "<p>Formal Writing is a vital skill in almost every workplace. This course can teach you how to excel in the crafting of reports, essays and formal letters.</p><p>All the skills you will need are broken down into bite-size chunks with clear explanations followed by opportunities to put these into practice. You can then check you progress as all the tasks and questions are followed immediately by the answers. </p><p>Suitable for almost all levels, you can pick and choose which skills to focus on, but there is so much ground covered that you will definitely find your horizons expanded. I have poured 10 years of teaching experience into these slides and they have been trialled with numerous groups in classrooms before being adapted for the Internet.  </p><p>As a special bonus, there is also a Masterclass in persuasive writing, which will teach you the skills necessary to communicate your point of view and convince your readers.  </p><p><br></p>",
