My name is Matt, and I run a website called The IELTS Teacher. I am a British native with a Bachelor's Degree in English, and have been helping students to learn English since 2008.

I have already taught thousands of 1-to-1 IELTS lessons, and helped hundreds of students towards their target scores. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\t      Technically speaking, there are actually 4 key ingredients to the course.
