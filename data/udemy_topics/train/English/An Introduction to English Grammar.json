    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course is about grammar, exactly the way new students in the classroom first want to see it: as an overview. It has video lectures to explain the form, meaning or function of the grammar point. After that, there is a short quiz to do to help you learn, keep the knowledge from the lesson. There are also additional downloadable things to help you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course is in three parts. The first part explains how to make grammar. The second part explains what the meaning of the grammar point is. The third section goes into more detail about specific grammatical points and how it works in real life.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Even if you are happy with your grammar, I recommend taking this course so you can better organise the information in your head.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course is 51 lectures and is a total of approximately 2.6 hours long. We recommend doing one session per day.  </p>",
