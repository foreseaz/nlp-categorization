    "description": "<p>The objective of this program is to have the pentatonic scale so etched into your brain that when you improvise in your favourite pop, r&amp;b or gospel song pentatonic melodies, or riffs and runs, just spill out of you!</p><p>In this program we learn through repetition and by logically grouping specific types of notes together using the visual aid of \"pentatonic triangles\" combined with audio clips. The triangles, when used in tandem with the audio exercises serve as a tool to help us to memorize the pentatonic scale, its inversions and other pentatonic melodies. </p><p>Terminology: Singing lessons, Improvisation, Riffs and Runs, melodies, Inversion, Vowel, Consonant.</p><p>Course Materials: Video tutorials, MP3 exercises</p><p>Structure: The course starts with a theoretical introduction to the Pentatonic Scale.  It then presents a series of melodies neatly organized in the form of a Triangle composed of numbers starting with full triangle exercises and progressing to half triangle exercises.  There is an MP3 exercise associated with each lecture.</p><p>Take this course if you would like to broaden your knowledge of pop, r&amp;b and gospel vocalization</p>",
