    "description": "<p>This course is all about learning how to sing in tune. It is all about mastering the ability to be on pitch and in tune. Before breath control, warm-ups, posture, resonance, shaping, and any other various real or imagined vocal techniques, one has to be able to simply sing in tune. Otherwise you are just yelling in an interesting manner.</p><p>If you have ever been told you were tone deaf or think you are tone deaf but want to sing, this course is for you. The gradual fundamental basics provided in this course will give you an unshakable ability to not only sing in tune, but sing well. And if you already can sing, this course may very well fill in those gaps in ability that you didn't even know existed.</p><p>I don't go into a bunch of flourish and filler and so forth.  The majority of this course is practical exercises, called drills, that are done in a specific order designed to build the correct singing foundation.  Along with these drills are downloadable versions of the drill instructions for you further unlimited use.</p><p>Taken from the first part of my book, Singing From Scratch, this course provides you the ability to sing in tune and the the tools needed to hone and master that ability to whatever extent you wish.<br></p>",
