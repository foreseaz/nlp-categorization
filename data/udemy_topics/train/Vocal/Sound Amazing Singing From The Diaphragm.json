    "description": "<h5>About This Singing Course:</h5>  <p><span>Master your diaphragm and its surrounding muscles, and you will certainly unearth your true vocal potential.&nbsp; Developing a great singing voice is about more than just your vocal cords; your whole body can be a source of power.&nbsp; In particular, the muscles of your torso (back, abdomen, ribs, chest, pelvis) are of great value.&nbsp; These muscles surround the diaphragm and aid it in functioning efficiently. This is the knowledge that singers like Carrie Underwood, Pavorotti, Renee Fleming, Celine Dione, David Phelps, and Christina Aguilera have taken full advantage of. </span>&nbsp;</p>  <h5>The Process Is Threefold:</h5>    <p><span>1) We must awaken the muscles and reflexes that are your birthright to command, but have - unfortunately - become weak due to lack of use.</span></p>    <p><span>2) We must then strengthen these muscles and teach them to aid the diaphragm in fueling your voice.</span></p>    <p><span>3) Lastly, we must isolate and strengthen the diaphragm itself.&nbsp; This is a very simple process, but one that has remained a &quot;secret&quot; amongst powerhouse vocalists for far too long.</span></p>  <h5>The Result:</h5>    <p><span>ENHANCED RANGE:&nbsp;The upper range becomes much easier to access!&nbsp;The larynx stabilizes, and register blend results more naturally.</span></p>    <p><span>VOCAL PROTECTION:&nbsp;Learning to sing with a connection to the body provides a healthier means of sound production.&nbsp; Incidence of hoarseness and vocal damage can be eliminated completely.</span></p>    <p><span>IMPROVED CONTROL:&nbsp;With the torso muscles controlling the air, instead of the neck, the vocal folds are free to be more responsive to your mental commands.&nbsp; Singing feels easier, more natural, and becomes more enjoyable.</span></p>    <p><span>BEAUTIFUL TONE:&nbsp;An &quot;ugly&quot; or harsh tone is most often the result of excessive neck tension.&nbsp; The true beauty and uniqueness of your voice is choked away, because of strain. When the tension is redirected to the proper torso muscles, the full overtones and true ring of the voice are restored.</span></p>    <p><span>VIBRATO:&nbsp;It&#039;s a byproduct of healthy tension/breath pressure.&nbsp; Vibrato frequently spontaneously results, as singers improve their breath control/body connection. &nbsp;</span></p>    <p><span>POWER/ BELTING:&nbsp;There is a very big difference between strong, powerful, beautiful singing and, wellâ€¦ yelling.&nbsp; Singers who lack connection to the support base of their bodies will invariably sound like they&#039;re screeching, instead of singing powerfully.&nbsp; The body connection makes all the difference in maintaining fullness and richness in belted tones.</span></p>  <h5>How Long Will It Take To See Results?</h5>    <p><span>Honestly, results are usually heard after the very first lesson. However, keep in mind that this is a process. We are building a support structure - a fuel base for your voice. With each lesson we will add another piece to the puzzle, until the picture is complete. The process WORKS, but you have to be diligent. Skipping lessons or failing to do the daily practice sessions is a surefire way to sabotage yourself.</span></p>    <p><span>Some of the exercises seem so simple, maybe even too good to be true; other exercises are kind of silly. But they work! Suspend your disbelief. Give yourself a chance to realize your full vocal potential. After 5 weeks, you&#039;ll be singing better than you ever have before, and the lessons will continue to grow your voice for many weeks beyond that.</span></p>  ",
