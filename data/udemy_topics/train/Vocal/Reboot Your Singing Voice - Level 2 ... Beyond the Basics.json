Now get excited about applying all the fantastic things you&#039;ve learned!  I&#039;ll show you exactly how to use what you&#039;ve learned to turn technique into performance.  <strong style=\"\">Technique is no good unless it&#039;s applied to actually singing a song.  And that&#039;s what we&#039;ll be doing, step by step.</strong></p><p>You need to know how to take what you learned in a vocal exercise, and use that knowledge to make singing easy!  At the end of this course you&#039;ll be able to identify your vocal problems, and know exactly how to solve them, no matter what style of music you sing.  This is a &#039;how to&#039; for sharing your voice.</p><p>It&#039;s one thing to do a vocal exercise -- but you need to know how to use that skill when you&#039;re singing a song in the real world!
