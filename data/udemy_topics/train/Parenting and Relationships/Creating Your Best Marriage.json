    "description": "<p><strong>Creating Your Best Marriage</strong> was designed for a marriage program that couples could complete in the privacy of their home.  I have a private practice and complete many large speaking engagements per year, but not everyone wants to tackle marriages issues in public.  In this course, the lectures have stories and experience that any marriage can relate to, with jokes and entertainment along the way.  Every less has written actionable advice and exercises that you can do with 3 minutes a day before sleep. You will learn how to improve:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Communication with your spouse and kids</li><li>Time prioritization between family and work</li><li>Preventing divorce and much more</li></ul>\n\n<p>Based on Gary's research, and over 25 years helping couples turn around their marriages, he brings you his 4 session program to create immediate change in your marriage. Gary believes in helping you get back to those feelings you first felt when falling in love with your spouse. He gives you tools that will instantly and positively impact your marriage. This program has been featured on the Today Show and numerous other programs. Bring Gary into your home with this 4 session program complete with workbook activities. </p>",
