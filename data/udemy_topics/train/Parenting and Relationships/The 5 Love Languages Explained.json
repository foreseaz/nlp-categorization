    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">The 5 Love Languages Explained: The Secret to Love That Lasts</strong> examines, distils and explains the theory of romantic love presented by Dr. Gary Chapman is his book, &quot;The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts&quot;. The central thesis of this book is that romantic love - the kind of passionate and euphoric state which we see depicted in movies, books and pop music - is, actually, a delusion intended to ensure the propagation of the species, not as a form of lasting happiness. As sobering as this thesis is, the good news is that lasting love can be achieved but only by couples who learn how to express love in their spouse&#039;s primary love language. The course is structured in 13 sections, with one lecture per section.  </p>",
