You will learn to break down the creative process into components, and discover a structured method that allows you to produce a polished presentation quickly. Completing this process will increase confidence in your personality and uniqueness.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on student demand, more emphasis may be placed on the \"political-economy\" of the dating industry. OKCupid, and other online dating platforms think first of maximizing profits, despite the flowery advertisements otherwise. Unfortunately, some of the ingredients to create a \"quality profile to attract more quality matches\" are not very politically correct. The work of mathematician &amp; hacker Chris McKinlay and columnist Dan Slater heavily influenced the seven step success process, not dating website instructions. However, by actively applying the concepts herein, you will better understand the fundamental reasons women generally do or do not respond to messages.</p>",
