    "description": "<p>In this course we offer parents and caregivers a 30 minute introduction to Alan Kazdin's research on Positive Discipline. Use our downloadable worksheets to follow along as we talk you through the steps from defining the behavior you want to change all the way to the dreaded timeout.</p>\n\n<p>We are not here to make judgments. There is no prescription for perfect parenting or perfect children for that matter, and we certainly wouldn’t ever want to make parenting more stressful than it already can be. Our goal is to <strong>de-stress</strong> your parenting experience by making lots of research-based practical and playful parenting tools and strategies available to you to help solve everyday parenting challenges and to inspire the kind of play and interactions that promote positive development. Use them for ideas or for inspiration so you can pick and choose what works for you and your family.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>",
