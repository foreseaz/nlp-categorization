Kids lock themselves in bedrooms for hours on end.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      David&#039;s son was &quot;<em>Educationally powerless but in &quot;Call Of Duty&quot; (he) commands an army</em>&quot;.  Delusional!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      David is not only a Graphic designer working with Video Game makers, he also has a son who is a video game addict and another who he has helped through the addiction to lead a normal life, and working on the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      You will learn the difference between addiction and obsession, what to do, how to handle it, and how to help your child (or someone you love) <strong>overcome this anti-social addiction</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>You have more control</strong> over your child <strong>than you think</strong>.  <strong>Regain the power</strong> in your relationship with your child now <strong>before it is too late.</strong> (Need some proof?
