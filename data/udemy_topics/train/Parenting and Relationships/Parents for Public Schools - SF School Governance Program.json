    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tSo, what is school governance and who is the ideal audience for this course?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tWell, we’ll talk more in depth about “the what” of the School Governance Program in the first section of this course, but school governance is essentially the formal ways in which people come together to make decisions on behalf of California’s public schools and the students they serve. For the purposes of this course, we will focus on school governance pathways that include – and are often led by – parents.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAs for “the who,” we’ve designed this course with California’s public school parents and caregivers in mind. As such, the content will be concise and relevant; key ingredients to ensuring you’ll be able to use what you learn today at your school site immediately.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tWe hope you enjoy this course as much as we’ve enjoyed designing this experience for you. Really like what you see? Contact Parents for Public Schools of San Francisco to learn about additional modules of the School Governance Program to broaden your understanding of these important topics.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"\">Let’s get started!</span>  </p>",
