    "description": "<p>\r\n\t   Weâ€™ve all heard the stories of toddlers who will only eat food that is yellow or shaped like a fish. Stories of picky eaters who refuse to eat their vegetables, sneak their dinner to the family dog at every opportunity and turn up their nose at anything not in the shape of a nugget. Eliminating picking eating behaviors and creating an adventurous eater starts at the moment you introduce solid foods. <em>A Solid Start</em> is a comprehensive course in infant and early childhood nutrition where you will learn how to properly introduce solid foods to your infant without the use of purees. A method that saves the family time, money and creates adventurous eaters! Most importantly, introducing solids the right way reduces the risk of obesity, diabetes, eczema and Celiac disease.\r\n</p>",
