    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     This course covers the nuts and bolts of online dating and explains how to move through the process from start to finish. By the end of the course you&#039;ll be able to engage in online dating in an effective manner. No prior knowledge of the subject is required -- all you need is a willingness to date other people and be open to forming a meaningful relationship. You&#039;ll learn how to:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Choose the best web platform for your online dating efforts.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Create a profile and select photos that draw positive attention.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Efficiently search for potential dates.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Communicate with people you are interested in and with people who are interested in you.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Go on actual dates.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t     The strategies you will learn are supported by scientific research and operate according to basic economic principles. Additional resources are available in supplementary materials.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     The course is organized in a series of easy-to-follow video lectures that conveniently last only a few minutes each and include plenty of examples. The entire course takes a few hours to complete, but then it&#039;s up to you to apply what you&#039;ve learned -- and practice makes perfect. The instructor is available to provide feedback and advice to help you answer these questions:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">What do I really want out of dating?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What is non-negotiable for me in a relationship?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Where can I find the people I want to connect with?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How much time and effort am I willing and able to put into dating at any given moment?</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Online dating takes a lot of patience, benefit of the doubt, and self-reflection. But the key to doing it effectively is to detach from the outcomes and try to learn what you can from the process itself. Once that happens, youâ€™ll find it to be a remarkably rewarding experience.  </p>",
