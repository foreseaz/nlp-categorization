You do not have to conform to any quests, guidelines, or rules. You do what you want, when you want. The game encompasses creativity and ingenuity, while also teaching patience and logical thought. There are no &quot;true&quot; restrictions. There is an incredible amount of educational value riddled throughout the game, and much of it will be outlined throughout this course.  </p>",
