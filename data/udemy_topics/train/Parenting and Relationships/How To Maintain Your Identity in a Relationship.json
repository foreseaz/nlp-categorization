    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  For years I would lose myself in relationships. I would fall so hard that my life became more about my partner than about my own wants and needs. It came to the point where I didn&#039;t even know who I was.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Maybe you&#039;ve felt the same, or are in a relationship right now where you are scared to lose who you are. Well, then this course is for you. In this course I teach you not only  how to maintain your identity within a relationship, but also how to tap into who you are so you know you&#039;re worth holding onto.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  No materials are needed, all that&#039;s required is that you come with an open mind and a commitment to doing the work. The course will be a mix of audio and text.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The point of the course is to introduce you to techniques that you can start applying now. To get you thinking and seeing your life in a different way so that you can begin to take care of yourself within relationships.  </p>",
