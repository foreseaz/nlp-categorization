    "description": "<p>This course considers the dynamics of dating and marriage from a historical perspective. Emphasis is on understanding relationship theories and structural changes within modern dating. Considerations from a historical and academic perspective are presented along with traditional \"people-skills\" training philosophy (i.e. Andrew Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People).</p>    <p>From a practical perspective, this course helps men attract a partner. However, the emphasis focuses on broad themes not specific dates or individuals to keep the class streamlined.</p>  <p>Instead of a specific list of assignments and directions, this class focuses on overall strategy, theory, and history. However, the course content can become particularly powerful when used to structure online profile personal statements (\"About Me/Summary) and similar activities. In addition, the considerations of learning differences, mental health, ethnic diversity and positive mental attitude will greatly assist some students. Ultimately, this course seeks to change the world by developing more men of character and wisdom by providing a bigger picture of modern dating &amp; marriage.</p>",
