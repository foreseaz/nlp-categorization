I've been coaching women one on one regarding intimacy for many years and I've written three books about intimacy. I decided that I could reach more women with an online course.  This course includes my three books, 14 videos, worksheets, homework and sexercises that are all design to help you care for yourself and grow closer with your partner. If you can commit to spending five minutes a day on improving your relationship, magical change can happen and you can have the relationship you desire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n  This course is respectful of your needs and desires and I strive to give you the tools to thrive within your relationship. Through this course I will help you to know what your role is in creating your ideal union. The course includes the specific steps that you can take to feel what you need to feel in order to be a happy, fulfilled woman. </p>",
