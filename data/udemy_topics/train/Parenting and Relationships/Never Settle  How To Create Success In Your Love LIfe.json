    "description": "<p>I believe that you can approach success in your love life the same way you approach success in your business. I link being a great spouse to being a successful entrepreneur because they are often required to take full responsibility for where they are and that goes for when they are winning or losing. You may or may not own your own business but I assure you that taking a piece of your time each week to work on yourself in the area of love will drastically increase your chances of finding and sustaining it. The same way allocated time to learning in the area of finances will drastically increase your bank account.</p>",
