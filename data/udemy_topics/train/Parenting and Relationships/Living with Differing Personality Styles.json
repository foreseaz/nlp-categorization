    "description": "<ul>\r\n\t<li>In this world, we are all unique.  We have our own personal style, our own way of communicating, making decisions, orienting to the outer world and how we get our energy.  If you&#039;ve ever wondered why you clash with certain people, are unable to get others to accomplish task, goals and objectives or even why your kids and husband seem to be so hard to understand . . . look no further.  We have the answers.  You are not crazy.... they are just not you.  Personality makes us unique and once we understand not only how we respond to the world, we can also understand how others do as well.  It will open new doors to understanding ourselves and building stronger relationships with those around us.  This workshop gives us the basics to understanding personality PLUS shows us ways to interact with others so we can reduce conflict and achieve greater harmony both in business and in life.  </li>\r\n</ul>",
