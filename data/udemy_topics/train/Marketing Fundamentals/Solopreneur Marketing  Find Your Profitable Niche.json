I am a self employed acupuncturist and prior to working with Lisa I was spinning my tail doing lots of stuff at once then getting tired and not doing anything for several months. I was feeling like my business was never going to grow. Lisa helped me to get clear about my business message, helped me to come up with strategic methods and timelines for reaching people, was a great sounding board for working out ideas and helping me to discern which marketing activities would NOT be worthwhile for me, my brand and my style.  I cannot recommend her enough.\"  </p>  <p>  \t                                                  ~ Marie B, 5 Star Review posted on Yelp  </p>  <p>  \t                                                  Click the <strong>\"take this course\" button, top right</strong>, ... don't waste time or money, get started now!  </p>  <p>  \t                                                  Lisa Cain  </p>",
