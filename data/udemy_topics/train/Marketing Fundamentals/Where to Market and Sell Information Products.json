This is a Beginner level course taught from real life examples and results - not theory. From 2009-December 30, 2012 I had hundreds of information products online producing zero dollars. Now I have over 20 on multiple platforms that sell every single day and I&#039;m sharing the #1 secret that you must learn online to succeed.  </p>  <p>  \t     I strongly suggest that you enroll in &quot;How to Create and Package an Information Product&quot; and complete this course so that you have a product to market and sell.  </p>",
