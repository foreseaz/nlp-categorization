    "description": "<p><strong>4 Fundamentals For Online Marketing Success - Course Description</strong><br></p><p>In this (less than 1 hr) course \"The First 4 Fundamental Steps Towards Online Marketing Success\" I reveal four of the fundamental steps critical to Online Marketing (Same for Internet Marketing) success. Miss the first two fundamental steps and you may be OK at the outset but as you get further down the road, you'll either begin to <em>flounder or stall</em>. Miss paying attention to the last two fundamental steps and your online marketing efforts will definitely <em>flounder and possibly fail.</em> </p><p>Because of the easy access to resources on the Internet, you may think that it's enough to just get started, thinking; \"I'll build my online marketing strategy along the way.\" Not so, without a clear vision of what you want to accomplish and the fuel to get you there is like arriving at your destination and being totally unprepared for what greets you. It may be a pot of gold. </p><p>This is the same as walking into a client meeting unprepared yet, confident that you can wing it and then walk out totally embarrassed. What happened? Most likely, you did not have the information the customer was expecting. You did not do your homework. Yikes!</p><p>In reality, it turns out that the homework may have been quite simple but required a focused effort. This is what this course on the first four steps towards online marketing is about. Although the four steps are fundamental, most online marketers miss them. So, don't be one of them. </p><p> I invite you to go ahead and watch the Intro and peruse the curriculum and get started. I think you'll be glad you did.</p><p><strong>Here's what others have said about Andre:</strong></p><p> <strong></strong><em>Should Be Required Instruction For All New Internet Business Owners.
