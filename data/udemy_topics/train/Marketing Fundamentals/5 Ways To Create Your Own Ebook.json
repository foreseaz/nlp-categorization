    "description": "<p style=\"\">Let me start off by saying that this course is NOT about teaching you what to write and the mechanics of writing an eBook. Rather it is focused on the HOW - The creative ways in which you can create an eBook from what you already know from knowledge gained or experience so that you can push out an eBook faster and without compromising the quality.</p><p style=\"\">Now, even though I don't focus on the WHAT, I know that there may be persons who register for this course that may still be on the fence about what to write. So to help you out and to get you rocking and rolling, I have provided a resource to help pull out ideas that you can work with at least at the start until you get comfortable and you are able to run on your own. I have also provided some FAQ's to answer some questions that may come to your mind plus some bonus tips to consider to ensure your book is complete and ready for public consumption.</p><p style=\"\">This course caters to all types of learners and is done in all formats- video, audio, text and powerpoint slides. So if you fit the profile of who should take this course as listed below, then let's not delay any further. Let's dig in and create that eBook!</p>",
