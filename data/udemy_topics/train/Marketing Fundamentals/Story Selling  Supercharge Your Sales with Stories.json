It's a way to connect with them and relate to their problems, frustrations and underlying emotions.</p><p>When you tell a story that has elements your prospects to relate to, it immediately persuades them to take action and buy what you're selling. As opposed to pure information without stories tends to “roll off” and not stick.</p><p>In this course, I teach you a simple framework for creating stories that persuade, trigger action and causes customers to buy your products and services.</p>",
