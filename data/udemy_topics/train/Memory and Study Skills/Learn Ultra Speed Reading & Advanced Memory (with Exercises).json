Speed reading \nmethods include chunking and eliminating subvocalization</p><p>Whether\n you're hitting the textbooks in philosophy class or reading the morning\n newspaper, reading can feel tedious. Train yourself to speed read to \nget through these tasks much faster. Reading faster does lead to less \nunderstanding, but with practice you can overcome some of this effect.</p><ul><li>Take a break every 30–60 minutes. This will keep you focused and reduce eye strain.</li><li>Analysing\n and changing your reading can become difficult because you start \nfocusing on your reading techniques rather than understanding the text. \nMake sure you're not reading too fast and you properly understand what \nyou have read.</li><li>Practice in a quiet, well-lit environment. Use earplugs if necessary.</li><li>If you can't improve your reading speed, have your vision checked.</li><li>Read\n important texts when you're alert and well-rested. Some people function\n well in the morning, while others think better in the afternoon</li></ul><p>Coming to memory improvement part,</p><p>There is no such thing as a \"bad memory\", and everyone can improve their\n memory, as long as you are not suffering from memory loss as a medical \ncondition. If you want to improve your memory, there are a number of \nthings you can do, from eating blueberries to using a variety of \nmnemonic devices. If you're optimistic and dedicated, you'll be able to \nimprove your memory, whether you want to win the World Memory \nChampionships, ace your history test, or simply remember where you put \nyour keys.</p><p>Do you have trouble remembering someone’s name ten seconds after being \nintroduced? Do you sometimes forget why you walked into a room? While \nfrequent occurrences like these could be a sign of a medical issue, it \nis far more likely that you could simply benefit from training and \ntechniques to increase your short term memory. If so, remember that this course is a good place to start!<br></p><p><br></p><p>I am hoping to meet you on the inside.<br></p>",
