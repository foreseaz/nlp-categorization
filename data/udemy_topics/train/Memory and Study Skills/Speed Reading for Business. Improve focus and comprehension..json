    "description": "<p>  \t            THIS IS THE 4 HOUR SPEED READING COURSE PROGRAMME THAT CAN DOUBLE YOUR READING SPEED  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">You will read at least 66% faster or your money back.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The teacher, Alex Garcez,</strong> gave up his Engineering degree in the third year because he was a very slow reader, however, his weakness became his strength, after taking a speed reading course, and deciding he was not going to become a laborer but an entrepreneur. Since then he took a Business Degree, Masters in Marketing and Advertising, and developed the <em style=\"\">Revolution Speed Reading Method. </em>He personally coached more than 3,500 people and most of his clients improve their reading speed by more than 100%.  </p>  <p>  \t            With more than 9,000 clients taking this two hour course online in 53 countries, Alex expects to motivate people to read more books. His method is based on science, and he has achieved amazing results while coaching professionals from companies such as: <strong style=\"\">Goldman Sachs, GE, J P Morgan, Google, Bloomberg, eBay, The Wall Street Journal, Sage, The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, Thomson Reuters, Adecco, Lloyds Bank, Citigroup, PwC, HSBC and O2.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            Alex Garcez discovered that your brain loves speed, and he thinks that fast is fun - slow is boring! If you think you have short attention span to read books, documents and social media, then you probably read slowly and carefully. Instead of understanding the text you get bored and distracted, needing to skip back to re-read text countless times. The main reason is that your brain is too powerful to go at such a slow pace and will drift off into something more interesting to think about.  </p>  <p>  \t            You will assess your reading speed at the beginning and throughout the course. So, if you spend 3 hours reading at work and improve your reading speed, on average, by 33%, you will save a whole month of work every single year.  </p>  <p>  \t            You can find more information at his website.  </p>  <p>  \t    Please Google &quot;The Speed Reading Coach&quot;  </p>  <p>  \t<u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">This is what you&#039;ll cover during the training course:</strong></u>  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li>Assessment of reading speed and comprehension</li>  \t<li>Understanding the Reticular Activating System</li>  \t<li>Reading actively instead of passively</li>  \t<li>Avoid back skipping to re-read</li>  \t<li>Brain waves to do intellectual work</li>  \t<li>Speed reading online software</li>  \t<li>Speed read without any training</li>  \t<li>See how the eyes work when you read faster</li>  \t<li>The mechanics of speed reading strategies</li>  \t<li>Understanding the left and right brain functions</li>  \t<li>Understand how to speed read using a pace maker</li>  \t<li>Speed reading practice</li>  \t<li>Expanding your memory</li>  \t<li>Understanding mental blocks</li>  \t<li>Further speed reading practice</li>  \t<li>Neuro-Linguistic Programming applied to speed reading</li>  \t<li>Develop your focus and online reading</li>  \t<li>Expanding peripheral vision</li>  \t<li>Advanced reading practice</li>  \t<li>Ergonomics and performance</li>  \t<li>Assessment of reading speed and comprehension</li>  \t<li>Using the Mini Max Target</li>  \t<li>How to plan to speed read a book</li>  \t<li>Motivation to start reading more</li>  \t<li>Becoming an expert in your area</li>  </ol>  <p>  \t            Take this speed reading course now, improve your reading skills and save your valuable time!  </p>  <p>  \t            This is a 4 Hour course.
