All you need is an easy-to-learn, step-by-step system. This course will teach you the entire Way of the Learner Comprehensive Study System in seven core lectures.<br></p>\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">“As one of the initial testers of the Way of the Learner Comprehensive System, I am so excited to see Ben moving forward with this program! As a lifelong student and accounting/finance professional, I highly recommend this course. I personally tested it in my Master's Level Finance studies through the The College for Financial Planning, and assure you that WOTL students will find themselves more attentive, and able and ready to quickly net down information for absorption and application--a critical life skill.” </em><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Benjamin P</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Having tested previous versions, I wish I had this program years ago! Ben has had a long-time passion for learning how to learn, and that is exactly what this course helps with. I remember him talking about this 5 years ago at the start of my bachelors. And now as I get ready to finish my doctorate in natural medicine, I can see how much his enthusiasm has aided my own educational goals and excellence.” Weston H</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Less stress. </em>Confusion is the source of much anxiety. How many times have you had to prepare for a test, but when you sat down to study, you had no idea what to do—whether to re-read the chapter or review your notes or highlight text. You just sort of winged it. The Way of the Learner Comprehensive Study System dissipates confusion by providing you a step-by-step procedure to mastering your studies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Greater confidence. </em>Once you have learned how to learn, learning becomes less challenging. You will not cringe at the sight of a large textbook or shirk that training manual that has been sitting on your desk. Having been fully equipped for battle, you are ready to conquer any learning obstacle confronting you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Increased enjoyment. </em>When you are no longer overwhelmed with your studies, you will begin to see that learning can be a wonderful experience. You may take up new hobbies or learn new skills. You may even find yourself engaged in “recreational studying.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">New opportunities. </em>Imagine what effect learning skills can have on your life. Think of all the areas in your life that could be improved through knowledge. What if you became the go-to expert in your field? How would your relationships improve if you were able to enhance your communication skills? Imagine the relief of learning how to manage your finances. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Way of the Learner Comprehensive Study System can truly transform your life.</p>",
