    "description": "<p><em style=\"\">*Note, this course is the prequel to the 3 part series on speed reading, note taking and memory.*</em></p><p>You might be thinking to yourself, <strong style=\"\">why didn&#039;t I just do a 4 part series?</strong></p><p>Well, I could have, I though about it. But the 3 parts above are really the key to learning something when you have a curriculum in front of you, which is common when you are in school.</p><p><strong style=\"\">The reason why this course is important is because self learning takes one key person out of the equation...your teacher.</strong></p><p>You pick your school, and you let them figure out who the best teachers are. </p><p>But when you are learning on your own, you don&#039;t have that certainty of knowing that you have a good teacher leading you on the right path towards learning your chosen subject matter.</p><p>Instead, you have hundreds of Youtube videos, thousands of books and millions of articles all competing to teach your the same subject matter.</p><p><strong style=\"\">So the question becomes, how do you choose where to learn from among all these options?</strong></p><p>How do you know you are on the right path? </p><p>Are you even looking in the right places? </p><p>Are you spending too much money? Or not enough?</p><p><strong style=\"\">Here&#039;s a thought exercise for you:</strong></p><p>Pick any subject you want to learn...just pick one, and imagine that you are now a student learning that subject at an ivy league school with the top expert in the world teaching you.</p><p>Except it&#039;s 30 years ago, mid 1980s. </p><p>Do you still want to learn from that person today? </p><p>Is information that is 30 years old still relevant and useful to you?</p><p><strong style=\"\">Maybe, but for many of you the answer is no.</strong></p><p>Look at almost any domain of knowledge, especially the ones related to skills of the future, and you will find that information gets old very quickly.</p><p>(And on the flip side, often times the classics from hundreds or thousands of years ago are better than any more modern treatment.)</p><p><strong style=\"\">So why go through this whole exercise?</strong></p><p>Because research isn&#039;t just about getting &quot;good&quot; information, it&#039;s about getting the information that is useful right now.</p><p>And much of what is easily available online is outdated.</p><p>But it&#039;s hard to know this when you don&#039;t know anything about how a certain field of knowledge is progressing. What was true and right and the best way 5 years ago is usually not what the thought leaders are doing today.</p><p><strong style=\"\">And if you are an entrepreneur, or looking to find a new career or do something on the side, you know that part of the secret to success is knowing about trends before they happen.</strong></p><p>Before I finish here, I want to ask you one more question:</p><p>How much time should you spend planning a project before you actually get started doing it?</p><p>The answer most people give is 10 or 20%. </p><p><strong style=\"\">But most of them rarely spend this much time, especially on big decisions.</strong></p><p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re going to learn that new subject you were thinking about earlier.</p><p>Rough estimate, maybe that is a 100 hour or 500 hour or 1000 hour skill. </p><p>Meaning maybe you don&#039;t spend that time to get to a beginner level, but that is the total time you will spend for the rest of your life using and developing and learning that skill. </p><p>Life long learning at it&#039;s core (Shout out to Scott).</p><p><strong style=\"\">What that means is, even if you are a risk taker, you probably don&#039;t want to go below 10% for planning.</strong></p><p>And research is your &quot;planning&quot; stage for learning. </p><p>If it&#039;s a big time skill, maybe it&#039;s even more than 1000 hours. That means you should be spending ALOT more time researching than you probably are right now.</p><p><strong style=\"\">It&#039;s so important to get this part right.</strong></p><p>Because if you learning the wrong framework, the wrong model, the wrong language, from the wrong teacher, you are going to have to re-learn that stuff later on, and at the same time fight off the old way of thinking.</p><p>That&#039;s why it takes pro golfers or NFL quarterbacks so long to fix their swing/throwing motion, because they have to undo thousands of hours of practice to build into muscle memory the new pattern.</p><p><strong style=\"\">But I get it, when you do the math it still does add up to a lot of hours, and you may be thinking, well...I already get enough out of Google. After a few pages the results aren&#039;t that good anymore anyways.</strong></p><p>Well, you are in for a surprise. Because this course is going to show you all the ways that most people never think about for how to spend that research time so that by the time you start, you are already in the fast lane and totally confident that you have the right info to learn going forward.</p><p>Research is the sleeper in the race because most people think they have it already figured out. It&#039;s the dark horse that will give you a permanent performance boost if you put your money on it.</p><p>If you&#039;re ready to ride, sign up above and let&#039;s get started.</p><p>Timothy</p>",
