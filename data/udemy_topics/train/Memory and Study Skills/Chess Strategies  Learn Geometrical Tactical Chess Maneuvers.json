    "description": "<p>This course covers geometrical chess motifs such as <strong>Blockade</strong>, <strong>Opening of a file (rank, diagonal)</strong>, <strong>Clearing the space</strong>, <strong>Damming and X-Ray Attack</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>This course really helps to see the whole board and to learn how to make your <strong>pieces interact</strong> even if they are located on different sides of the board! </p>\n\n<p>We will demonstrate not only the concept of these tactical chess manoeuvres but also the logic behind finding these moves in your own chess games. </p>\n\n<p>This course is broken down into 5 sections (one for each motif). In each section you will find 3-4 tutorials analysing different chess puzzles (the difficulty of the positions analysed in these puzzles increases as you go along). </p>\n\n<p>Also each section contains an analysis of a game played between two chess grandmasters to demonstrate how effective these tactical manoeuvres can be and finally we prepared <strong>quizzes</strong> for you to practice and the end of each section.</p>\n\n<p>We look forward to seeing you in class!</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely, </p>\n\n<p>Mark and Viktor</p>",
