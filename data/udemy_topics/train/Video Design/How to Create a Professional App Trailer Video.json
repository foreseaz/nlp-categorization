No After Effects experience required!</strong><br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t       Introducing the app trailer course that allows you to create professional looking promotion videos in minutes. The included After Effects template was built with an app reskinning mindset. Simply replace a few graphic elements in the Resources folder.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Only 8 Graphic Files to Change!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      There are only 8 graphic files you need to modify or change. That’s it! Just name your new files the same as the existing files in the Resources folder to customize the templates. The files consist of 4 PNGs, 3 PSDs and one MP3 per template.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">For Portrait and Landscape Apps</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This course actually includes two separate After Effects templates that will each output 15 second app trailers. One template is designed for apps in built in Landscape orientation, the other template is for apps built in Portrait orientation. You can easily “reskin” the templates with new graphics to create multiple videos for your app.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Create 3 iTunes Screenshots Automatically!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      In addition to creating 15 second trailers, the templates will automatically build the 3 screenshots you’ll need in iTunes Connect when you’re setting up your app for submission. The screenshots will be rendered in these 3 sizes without any additional work.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><u style=\"\">Portrait Screenshot Sizes<br style=\"\">  \t</u></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·1536x2048  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·640x1136  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·649x960  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><u style=\"\">Landscape Screenshot Sizes<br style=\"\">  \t</u></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·2048x1536  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·1136x640  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·960x640  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      The best thing about these screenshots is that it takes ZERO additional work to create them! Once you have replaced the graphic assets for your video, the screenshots are already done without you having to spend any additional time on them!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Template Features</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Built in Adobe After Effects (.aep files)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·1280x720 HD video resolution  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Only 8 files to change  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Switch from Black or White iPhone graphic  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Selectable background colors  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Create 3 App screenshots with no additional work  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      ·Detailed Instructions  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t ·Unlimited Use License of included templates  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      An app trailer is an important part of your ASO and app marketing plan.
