You can use them as an overlay and even as a transition between two video clips. </p><p>If you go online, you will find that there is a plethora of light leaks already available for sale, and even some for free. But why buy or download one when you can do it yourself? in this course I’m going to show you how you can create and customize your own organic light leaks, and then I’ll teach you a variety of ways to use them in your projects. </p><p>The cool part is, you don’t need any professional video or photography equipment to create these. I’ll be using all common items you will most likely already own. </p><p>I designed this course for anyone interested in video content creation, whether you’re a hobbyist shooting video on the weekends, or a filmmaker or television production professional.</p><p>So there’s absolutely no reason why YOU can’t take this course. So let’s get started.<br></p>",
