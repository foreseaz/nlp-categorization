He's so knowledgeable in editing, and fixing tracks so they're usable. His course helped me edit many minutes of recorded audio from a client that had constant fan hiss on it. His suggestions cleaned up the file so I didn't have to ask my client to re-record several hours of content.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>I highly recommend Soren as a great instructor. Soren's idea to easily block background noise from the sides and back of a mic is something that I really needed. His straightforward instructions made it really easy for me to save $200 to $800 (which is the price at B&amp;H audio) for a similar noise reduction device. I spent under $10 on his solution, and it was fast, easy and fun to put together. I highly recommend this course to any one who wants to know how to do recording and noise reduction better, and to anyone who wants to save considerable expense on audio recording equipment accessories.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>by Rick Worsnop</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>I recommend this \"how-to\" course. It will help improve your voice recordings.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>This course deals with a major issue that plagues voice recordists: noise. It shows you how to reduce noise at the source, by reducing what gets into your microphone, then how to clean up what's left with your recording software.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>The most fun part of this course for me was the Do-It-Yourself intro to building sound modifiers, like a pop filter and sound-proof surrounds for your mic. I thought the pop filter design was particularly ingenious, and all of these DIY projects could save you a lot of cash while greatly improving your sound.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>The section on using audio software like Audacity or Sound Forge, to clean up noise in a recording, was also useful. The instructor used features like normalization, EQ and compression that are widely available and work similarly in most recording apps. This is the only place I felt the course fell a little short. There was a lot of normalizing and tweaking of EQ without much explanation, and that may mystify some people. In the case of a track with one or more transient peaks (from lip smacks or other extraneous noises) normalizing won't appear to do much at all. I wish the instructor had mentioned to go through the audio and manually edit out such noises before normalizing.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>There's some good advice in the summary bullet points at the end of the course, and I could see this material growing into a more detailed sequel.</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Overall, I enjoyed the course and would recommend it as well worth the $19 tuition.</em>  </p>",
