In the Field Production workshop, we focus on ease, affordability and resourcefulness in professional-quality video production.</p><p>The Field Production Workshop takes students into the process of cinematography, lighting and audio. With a focus on the manual controls available through larger 3-chip DV cameras, such as the Sony Z5U, <strong>this class is intended for individuals who either already have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of video production or who have never even touched a camera before!</strong> Learn how to use manual shutter speed, iris, focus, and audio like a pro to get the highest quality video possible!</p>",
