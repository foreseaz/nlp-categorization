    "description": "<p>  \t  Most so called 'street fighting' courses are taught by instructors who have never seen an angry man in their lives. When it comes to defending yourself from an aggressive assailant who is probably both drunk and high on drugs you will find that fancy techniques simply don't work.  </p>  <p>  \t  Tony Somers and Matty Evans are acknowledged experts in situational awareness, conflict avoidance and Real Self Defense. This is the fighting system created by Geoff Thompson who has had over 200 real fights while working as a doorman in some of the toughest pubs and nightclubs in the UK.  </p>  <p>  \t  What you are about to learn is not pretty but it could save your life. First you will learn how to engage your attackers fear response before you move onto street punching, stranges, chokes, aggression and most importantly the 'fence' which is a protective space you can use.  </p>",
