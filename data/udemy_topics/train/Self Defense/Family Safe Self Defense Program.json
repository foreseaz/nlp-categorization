    "description": "<p>Your kids are facing more and more sophisticated predators every day. While we think \"stranger danger\" is all they need to know, but in reality children are abducted, bullied and sexually assaulted 80% of the time by someone they know. <br></p><p>This program will guide parents to help kids deal with this fact. Family safe is based on law enforcement and psychological research and delivered in a way that will enable you to talk about it with your children without scaring them. </p><p>You will give your child a specific set of rules to follow when they are out of your supervision either at school, a friends house or at the park. When one of the 6 RULES is broken your child will know it is time to take action and escape. <br></p><p>This is not something for you to sit and make your child watch...this is for you and you're going to need to tell them and show them. It's simple and only takes an hour to watch the program and then a handful or minutes a couple of times a week to talk to your kids. We've included some drills as well if you feel the need to bring it to the next level. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
