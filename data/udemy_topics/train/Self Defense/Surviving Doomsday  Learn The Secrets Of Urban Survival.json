And people died.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>2015 :</strong> The Paris Terrorist Attacks</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2015 :</strong> Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake),which killed more than 7,000 people and injured more than twice as many, magnitude 8.1 !!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2011 :</strong> The Tsunami in Japan forced 300,000 people to evacuate their homes. People died of starvation and other incidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2010 :</strong> The earthquake in Haiti killed an estimated 300,000 people. Think about that! That's 100 times the amount of people that died in the terrorist attacks on US soil on September 11</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2010 :</strong> BP oil spill that caused marine and wildlife in the region to die after 210 MILLION gallons of oil flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. Many people who were dependent on the marine and wildlife to feed their families were suddenly out of business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2005 : </strong>Hurricane Katrina hit the United States, causing billions in property damage. Looting, violence, and chaos erupted as violence spread across several cities. People were “sheltered\" in the Superdome in New Orleans where 6 people were found dead and several people were raped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2004 :</strong> The Indian Ocean Tsunami killed over 230,000 people in 14 different countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This doesn't even take into account the dozens of tornadoes, blizzards, snowstorms, droughts, fires, earthquakes, mudslides, droughts, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, and other catastrophes that hit the United States and other regions on a daily basis.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>P.S. </strong>We're living in some of the craziest times in history and many experts agree that it's not a matter of “if\" but “when\" you will face an emergency that is beyond what you and your family have prepared for.
