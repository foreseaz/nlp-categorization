The concept of using electricity for self-defense has been in place since the 1800s, but has been implemented for civilian use until only just recently in the 1980s and 90s. During these periods, products as the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">stun </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">gun </strong>and the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">TASER </strong>were born.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Of ALL the self-defense products on the market, <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">electroshock weapons </strong></em>are by far the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">most misunderstood</strong>. For example, did you know that...<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Stun Guns </strong></em>and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">TASERs</em></strong><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> </em>are different products?</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Amperage </em></strong>is more important than<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> </strong><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">voltage</strong></em>?</li><li>In some states it is<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> ILLEGAL </strong>to own electroshock weapons?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You most likely were not aware of these facts! Stun guns and TASERs, like any other self-defense product, are <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">weapons<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">. </strong></em></strong>And for any weapon (or tool, for that matter), you should know how to properly use it. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to teach you everything that you need to know about these very popular, yet highly misunderstood, self-defense tools.
