Through the teaching methodology of the Progressive System you will build a strong foundation for the principles and techniques of  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. </p><p>The BJJ Progressive System was developed and created by Mestre Sylvio Behring. Mestre Behring created the progressive system as a teaching tool to help develop the foundations of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Self-defence for the beginner to the most advanced. The Progressive System is a world-wide awakening to this one of a kind teaching methodology.  </p><p>Two of the greatest minds in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu today, both Mestre Sylvio Behring and Professor Shah Franco have passed their knowledge onto one of their top students and teachers, Professor Jesse Richardson.  </p><p>Professor Jesse Richardson, co-founder of Matador Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has now taken this invaluable knowledge of the Progressive System and has evolved it once again to a new level of understanding and teaching methodology.  </p><p>This teaching methodology of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu can be used with the traditional gi, no-gi or with normal street clothes. Featured in this course are basic modifications and variations that you can apply to almost every situation in self defense or sport Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>",
