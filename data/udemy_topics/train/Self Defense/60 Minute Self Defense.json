Introducing the 60 Minute Self Defense Program featuring SDTS Combatives. <br><br>Contrary to what you've been told, you don’t have to be an ultimate fighter, super soldier or grand master 10th degree black belt to defend yourself. All you need are a few basic moves, understand a couple of primary principles and you will be able to identify, avoid and escape any assault.<br><br></p><p>The program starts with strategy and builds your self defense plan that begins with awareness and avoidance. Then takes you through nonlethal weapons like pepper spray and personal alarms, then moves you through striking, defense against multiple attackers, grabs and hold and finally what to do if you're on the ground facing much larger and multiple attackers. <br></p><p>This is for you if you want to know the bare [and BRUTAL] necessities of self defense. </p><p><br></p>",
