In this lecture I break down the secret formula that I used to change my life over the course of 2 years.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I grew up in a low income family, with a mother who had a serious depression and a father who was a janitor.  Both of my parents loved me immensely but the tools were not presented as simple as they were to be successful.  Over the course of my life i put together the tools I show you that helped me change my life forever.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIf you loved my class please give me a positive review it really does help.
