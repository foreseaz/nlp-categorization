You will learn how to effectively  create, generate and distribute a complete and functional Adobe  Captivate Simulation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        You will learn how Captivate records a software simulation, how to configure Captivate to better work with your own Simulations, what objects are added by Captivate and how to configure  the objects to suit you for your own desired look and feel.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        There are no additional supplemental materials provided as all you will need is a computer and Captvate 8.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Many Captivate courses begin with introducing you  to the application, pointing out this and that in the very beginning.  This course takes a different approach. One more realistic in the way  that typical authors actually USE and experience Adobe Captivate. It&#039;s  WORKFLOW based, and Captivate is gradually introduced to the learner.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        Along the journey, best practices and tips are offered to help you be more effective.  </p>",
