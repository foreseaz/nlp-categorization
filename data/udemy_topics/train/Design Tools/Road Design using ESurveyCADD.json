    "description": "<p>Designing Road with ESurvey CADD</p><p>ESurvey CADD can be used for creating Geometric design of roads and highways, Railways and canals. Prepare Cross Section, L Section and quantity calculation of Road, Canal, Nala, Pipe, Rail Road Etc.,. In this series of videos you will learn how to create an ESurvey CADD file for designing Roads. </p><p>One of the Challenges Road Design Engineers face while trying to use the latest technology tolls is that, if they start using the software, Learning software will take a lot of time and even if it is learnt they find it difficult to access the support and finally end up in making the drawings &amp; volumes by consuming more time. All these days most road designers believed that it is a complex process and needs expertise to handle the software. At ESurvey we have tried our best to make design of road a comfortable, pleasant and user friendly experience, for completing the geometric design and computation of volumes based on the created cross sectional template.</p><p>Road Design module of ESurvey CADD includes designing Horizontal Curve, Vertical Curve, Profile Correction, Super Elevation, Road Widening, Plan Profile creation etc. for both new and existing road projects including strengthening and widening.</p><p>Take 45 Minute course to believe what we claim. Thank you very much for watching the introduction video. </p>",
