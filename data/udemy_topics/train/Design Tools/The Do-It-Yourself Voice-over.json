    "description": "<p>  \t        You hear voice-overs just about every day. On the radio, television production, films, training videos, web presentations, and on commercials on TV are just some of the productions that use voice recordings.  </p>  <p>  \t        Voice-overs are recorded and placed over the top of a video or film and commonly used in documentaries or news reports to explain information.  </p>  <p>  \t        Although many of these are hired professional voice-overs, many people are unaware that producing a good voice-over isnâ€™t as difficult as they might think and the equipment you need  is inexpensive. And you don&#039;t need to have a naturally gifted voice to create a good quality voice-over.  </p>  <p>  \t        In this course you will learn about basic audio  recording techniques, equipment options, acoustic treatment, and how to  properly use equipment for producing great voice-overs. In addition to the technical aspect of this  course, you will also learn about how to prepare for the script.  </p>  <h4></h4>",
