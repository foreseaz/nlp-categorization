You will learn what the software does, how to install the software, set up for your first recording, record your screen, edit that recording, add some audio, and finally produce your first video.  </p>  <p>  \t  Download PDF resource guides which include section summaries and hyperlinks to additional learning material.  Practice what you learn by creating your own files and downloading course files.  Watch as I go through the same steps to edit a real lesson for Udemy.  Post questions and answers to help fellow students.  Send messages or ask questions and receive answers from me within a week.  </p>  <p>  \t  The linear format of this course allows beginners to start with the first video lesson and move through the course step by step.  This course is also modular so you can jump directly to the sections you need without having to go through the material you are already familiar with.  </p>  <p>  \t  Check out the free resources available in this course and be sure to enjoy the Top Five Tips video.  </p>",
