    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t If you have <strong style=\"\">never opened Final Cut X</strong> and are learning it for the first time, this is the right course for you. If you are upgrading from iMovie or coming from a past version of Final Cut, then this course will also be a great guide in order to help you through the new features that Final Cut X offers.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t I have been using Final Cut Pro since version 4 came out and I remember reading through hundreds of pages of the manuals in order to learn. I wish I had video tutorials to learn from but video training wasnâ€™t popular yet so I had to teach myself.  All these videos are 1920 x 1080 which means that you can see every pixel of my screen (nobody likes watching low quality tutorials).  When you finish the checkout a download will automatically begin.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t The course includes some of the practice footage so you can follow along with the lessons.  </p>",
