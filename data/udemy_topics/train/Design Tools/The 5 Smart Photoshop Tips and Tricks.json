    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t          This course covers 5 main fundamental Photoshop skills that will allow you to branch your skills out further for more flexibility and speed. If it has been a long time since you have used Photoshop this is great as a refresher course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          You should successfully complete the course within 5 days, but remember it is practice that will make you fluent. To help with this further, high resolution images have been provided for you to practice your new skills.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          This course consists of 5 in-depth video lessons to leave you with specific skill sets that will allow you to confidently practice on your own initiative.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This is a slow paced course deliberately designed to cater for all learning abilities. For those of you that already have a fairly good understanding of Photoshop you may find this course a little slow as I cover every single detail and also give examples of how it should not be done.  </p>",
