This course is designed for the absolute beginner, meaning no previous experience with SolidWorks is required. If anyone wants to fill up his/her gap regarding SolidWorks assembly topic, then this is also right course for them.<br></p><p> <br style=\"\"> <br style=\"\"> <em><strong></strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Follow along with our expert instructor in this training course to get:</strong></em></p><p>Concise, informative and broadcast-quality SolidWorks Parts Essential training videos delivered to your desktop.</p><p><strong>4.5+ hours of HD video tutorials</strong></p><p><strong>Over 76 individual video lectures</strong></p><p><strong>An online quiz (30 questions)</strong> - to test what you've learned in SolidWorks assembly topics</p><p><strong>Exercise files</strong> â€“ to help you become proficient with the material.</p><p>The ability to learn at your own pace with our intuitive, easy-to-use interface</p><p>A quick grasp of even the most complex SolidWorks 2015 assembly Essential subjects because they're broken into simple, easy to follow tutorial videos.</p><p>You will start by learning basic and intermediate topics in assembly such as create assembly, positioning parts, apply mate and so on. This video tutorial will then cover how to apply basic mate and different types of mate option. Then this course will also cover lots of intermediate topics such as advanced mate type, handling sub-assembly, apply assembly level features and so on. Then, you will learn how to work with advanced tool such as linear, circular, sketch driven pattern and so on. Finally, this course will also cover few advanced topic such as assembly configuration, fixing mate error, top down assembly etc.</p><p><br style=\"\"> Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will be fully capable of using these tools and techniques to create your own assembly and get control perfectly using this 3D modeling software. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons. One quiz is also added to evaluate your skill after learning this course.</p><p>In this SolidWorks 2015 Assembly Essential training video tutorial series, you'll quickly have relevant skills for real-world applications.</p><p><strong><em>We will cover the following topics</em></strong></p><p><strong>Creating Assembly</strong></p><ol> <li>Making new assembly</li> <li>Add multi parts</li> <li>Positioning parts</li> <li>Add mate to all parts</li> <li>Apply different type mate</li> </ol><p><strong>Mate type</strong></p><ol> <li>Concentric</li> <li>Parallel mate, Tangent mate and perpendicular mate</li> <li>Distance</li> <li>Angle</li> <li>Smart</li> <li>Multiple mate mode</li> </ol><p><em><strong>Working with sub-assembly</strong></em></p><ol> <li>Create sub assembly inside another assembly</li> <li>Make sub assembly in flexible state</li> <li>Add empty part to the assembly</li> <li>Create virtual assembly</li> <li>Create folder to organize assembly</li> </ol><p><strong>Assembly level features</strong></p><ol> <li>Extrude Cut</li> <li>Feature scope of Extrude Cut</li> <li>Revolve Cut</li> <li>Fillet</li> <li>Chamfer</li> <li>Weld bead</li> <li>Hole series</li> <li>Create smart component</li> <li>Apply smart component</li> <li>Belt chain feature</li> <li>Swept cut</li> <li>Regular exploded view</li> <li>Radial exploded view</li> <li>Interference detection tool</li> </ol><p><strong>Pattern type</strong></p><ol> <li>Linear component pattern</li> <li>Circular component pattern</li> <li>Pattern driven component pattern</li> <li>Sketch driven component pattern</li> <li>Curve driven component pattern</li> <li>Mirror component</li> </ol><p><strong>Advanced mate type</strong></p><ol> <li>Profile center mate</li> <li>Symmetric mate</li> <li>Limit distance and angle by mate</li> <li>Width mate</li> <li>Path mate</li> <li>Linear coupler mate</li> <li>Cam mate</li> <li>Slot mate</li> <li>Gear mate</li> <li>Screw mate</li> <li>Hinge mate</li> </ol><p><strong>Work with mate errors</strong></p><ol> <li>Mate Reference</li> <li>Capture mate Reference from assembly level</li> <li>Solve common mate error</li> <li>Solve mate problem using MateXpert</li> <li>Replace mate entities</li> <li>Copy with mates</li> </ol><p><strong>Assembly configuration</strong></p><ol> <li>Making new assembly level configuration</li> <li>Control feature in the assembly level configuration</li> <li>Advance option in configuration properties</li> <li>Parent-child option in configuration properties</li> <li>Design table</li> <li>Speedpak</li> </ol><p><strong>Top down assembly</strong></p><ol> <li>What is top down assembly</li> <li>Top down design environment</li> <li>Visibility option for part mode in assembly</li> <li>Power of in-context feature</li> <li>In-context feature in depth</li> <li>Create new part in assembly</li> <li>Virtual part vs external part</li> <li>External reference</li> <li>oRemove external reference</li></ol>",
