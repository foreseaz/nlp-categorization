We will start with the Rectangular Marquee tool, the Elliptical Marquee tool. Then later we move on to the Lasso tools, and finally to the Quick Selection tools. We also cover how to make complicated selections in a refined way. We look into the Refine Edge panel that has come about after Photoshop CS5 and how it is a very powerful tool to make selections of difficult objects like hair.<br><br>If you're someone who has to make composites from photographs or even apply adjustments to parts of your photographs, you definitely need to take this course.<br></p>",
