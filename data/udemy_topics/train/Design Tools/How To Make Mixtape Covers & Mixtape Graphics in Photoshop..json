Many of these videos play music in the background, don't talk about the steps slow enough to understand or speed the video up super fast confusing you even more. When you have a question, they don't reply or even bother helping you.  </p>  <p>  \t                       You want someone who will teach you step-by-step right?

You'll now be able to do it yourself and make a hot cover like the majors.</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>- No more waiting on the designer to finish when he's ready. </strong></li>  \t<li><strong>- Charge other rappers to make their mixtape covers.

Many don't know how to.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>And 2. </strong>Because if mixtape designers reveal their secrets on how they make the mixtape covers, you won't hire them when you need a mixtape cover.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Well can't I can go to YouTube and learn?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                            Sure, check out YouTube. First off -- The videos that show you how to design mixtape covers aren't user-friendly. They <strong>don't</strong> take the time to show you the steps or explain slow enough on how they create them. They rush through the steps. They speed through it all. They play music in the background and don't talk teaching you how they did it. They don't answer questions helping you.  </p>  <p>  \t                                              This training series does take the time to show you step-by-step on making mixtape covers easy in Photoshop.  </p>  <p>  \t                                            If your <strong>SERIOUS</strong> about learning, join this class.
