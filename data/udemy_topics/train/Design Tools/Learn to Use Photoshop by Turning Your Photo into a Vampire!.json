Over the course, we&#039;ll show how to not just add fangs, but also show exactly <em>how we made our model go from tan, to pale white</em>…WITHOUT losing her skin texture! We take you step by step from the original image, to a pretty convincing vampire.</p><p>This course takes the average beginner about 2 hours to get through, if following along, and has plenty of tips and tricks to sink your teeth into… sorry for the pun :)</p><p>Enjoy!</p>",
