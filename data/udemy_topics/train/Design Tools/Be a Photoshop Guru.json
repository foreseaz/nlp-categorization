Whether you have been using Photoshop for years or are learning for the first time, you will quickly discover new applications to create stunning images with this photography video. Much more than just a how-to Photoshop video, “Be a Photoshop Guru” introduces the most important tools in Photoshop and then gives you very creative ways of applying them for amazing results. This program doesn’t just simply show what the tools do; it shows you how to use them in your photography! In this video Jim uses CS4, however this program is designed to help users of any version of Photoshop because it focuses on techniques rather than teaching a specific version of Photoshop.
