    "description": "<p>The cornerstone of this course is engineering simulation and I will use an example focusing on the aerodynamics of drones to teach you how simulation can be incorporated in engineering and design.  </p>\n\n<p>For this course, we will be using SimScale, which is a browser-based software. The platform can be directly accessed at www.simscale.com </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will start off the course with a very short introduction to aerodynamics and how a propeller works.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then we will jump into creating the physics-based simulation of a 3D printed mini quadcopter using SimScale. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude the course we’ll take what we have learned and discuss how engineering simulation can be used to optimize the design of the propellers. In the hand-on exercises you will be using SimScale to simulate the quadcopter with 2 different propeller designs so that we can compare their aerodynamic performance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Prior knowledge of basic engineering concepts and CAD design are helpful but not required for success in this course.</p>",
