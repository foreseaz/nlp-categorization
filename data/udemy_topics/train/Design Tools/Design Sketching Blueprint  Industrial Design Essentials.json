Maybe you're a fashion designer or industrial design student who use sketching to visualize your ideas or maybe you're just starting out and want to learn the basics of design sketching, then this course is for you.</p><p><strong>What will I learn in this course?</strong></p><p>You will learn how to improve your line quality, exercises for sketching smooth lines and curves, how to sketch a perfect circle free hand, practice ellipses in perspective, introduction to product design sketching, form idea generation, how to use simple geometries to simplify the design process and so much more!</p><p>Thank you for taking interest in my course, I hope to see you inside.</p><p>Your instructor,</p><p>Marouane</p>",
