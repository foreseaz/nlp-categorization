    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Introduction:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"></strong>Welcome to Developing Star Trek Effects in After Effects. We will becreating several awesome effects in a style similar to the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies.The Effects we will create are: A Starship in space, A Ship ﬂy by, A Starship shooting a Missile, Phasers and Pulse Guns, Transporters, and Forceﬁelds. We will use After Effects and 2 Video Copilot Plugins (Optical Flares and Element 3D) to create these effects. We will also talk about perfect compositing: perspective, aesthetics, randomize, feathering, environment, color &amp; timing.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Lesson 1: Ships in Space</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \t </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t       We will be using After Effects tools as well as plug-ins to create a scene of a Starship  </p>  <p>  \t       ﬂying in space that is located near a planet.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Class 1</em></strong>: Explain the effect and about 3D Models and how to ﬁnd them on the net. Also,we will talk about what 3D models work with the Element 3DPlugin.

We will learn a matting technique to work with trees in footage and other helpful compositing tricks like adding wiggle and motion blur to a whole scene to increase the action.  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Class 1:</strong></em> Explain what the overall effect is, the tools/ assets needed and where  </p>  <p>  \t      someone could ﬁnd them.

We will use Optical Flares to create pulse blast and the beam effect to create phasers. We will also learn how to use AE lights to create casted light from our blast on the ground, and some tracking tips.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Class 1:</em></strong> Explain what the overall effect is, the tools/ assets needed and where  </p>  <p>  \t      someone could ﬁnd them.

We use Keylight to get alpha channels from our green screen footage using a special nested  comp technique. Then we will use our alpha channels and particles to create this effect. We will also learn some color correcting techniques.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Class 1:</em></strong> Explain what the overall effect is, the tools/ assets needed.

We will use the CC Sphere effect and Fractal Noise to create a  </p>  <p>  \t    cool forceﬁeld effect. We will also learn some other techniques to create a cool techie texture and some more lighting tips.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Class 1:</em></strong> Explain what the overall effect is, the tools/ assets needed and where  </p>  <p>  \t    someone could ﬁnd them.
