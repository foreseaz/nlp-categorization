For example, you can create an action that changes the size of an image, applies an effect to the image, and then saves the file in the desired format.  </p>  <p>Actions can include steps that let you perform tasks that cannot be recorded (for example, using a painting tool). Actions can also include modal controls that let you enter values in a dialog box while playing an action.  </p>  <p>  \t                                              In this course i'll show you how to create photoshop actions<strong> By Creating 5 Projects</strong> !  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Project 1 - Create a HD Qulity Image Retouch action</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                  Into our 1st project we'll create a Image retouch action which make any image look like a HD Image.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Project 2 - Create a 3D Image Action</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                  Into our 2nd project we'll create a 3d image action which make any image look like a 3d image.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Project 3 - Create a Hand Sketch Image Action</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                  Into our 3d project we'll create a Hand Sketch Image Action which make any image look like a Pencil Sketch potrate.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Project 4 - Create a Oilpaint Image Effect Action</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                  Into our 4th project we'll create a Oilpaint image Effect Action which make any image look like a oil painted.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Project 5 - Create a Glowing Text Action</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                  Into our 5th project we'll create a Glowing Text Action which give us a nice glowing text effect.  </p>  <p>  \t  ...and after these projects end i'll show you <strong>how to sell these actions for profit</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t<em>There is nothing to lose in these course but you <strong>Learn Some Solid Skill.</strong></em>  </p>",
