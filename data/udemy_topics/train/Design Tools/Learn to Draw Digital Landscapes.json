I will teach you how to draw and paint each element that makes up landscapes. Learn to paint the sky and clouds, and add color to the sky. I will teach you how to draw and paint trees that are full and bare. Learning to draw grass, weeds, and other foliage as well as rocks, water, and reflections in the water. I will show you how to paint in the ground that will have the real colors of the grass and dirt areas using perspective techniques to show different angles of the ground. Finally, I will show you how to create custom Photoshop brushes to make your drawing and painting easier. Learning to create custom brushes is a steal in itself, you could create custom brushes and sell those.  </p>",
