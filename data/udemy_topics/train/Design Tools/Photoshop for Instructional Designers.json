    "description": "<p>  \t      This course will introduce you to various functions an instructional designer needs to know in order to carry out their job. Although an instructional designer is NOT a graphic designer, knowing the basic functions of Photoshop assist tremendously in day-to-day tasks. </p><p><strong>Please note: this course is NOT a how to do everything in Photoshop course, it is for people that need Photoshop to carry out their day to day tasks as an Instructional designer.  There has been negative feedback because the course is not \"complete,\" again, this is not a course that will teach you all functions, but rather which ones I use day to day as an instructional designer in creating learning materials.  It really is not common that I use all the Photoshop functions during my work. If you are not involved in training or education this course might seem lacking, but it is the stuff I do on a daily basis.  Have fun!</strong></p>  <p>  \t      Photoshop is a graphics-editing program that is used to create and manipulate images. The program's versatile nature makes it useful for a huge range of imaging tasks, and Photoshop is used in a myriad of fields. If you hear people talk about layers, masks, graphic design, tools, palettes, magic erasers, layer masks, transparencies, PNG files, JPEG files, PSD files, and other terms regarding Photoshop but don't know what they all mean, this course is for you!  </p>  <p>  \t      This course will cover basic Photoshop functions and their application to creating learning materials by an instructional designer in their day to day tasks.
