    "description": "<p>  \t  In the past 5 releases Revit MEP has really matured and found critical mass within the engineering and building design field. This VTC course will give you a foundation for every feature you will need to successfully model the systems of a building and release a set of construction documents. Author Damon Ranieri will first focus on the picks, clicks, and tools most often sought after as a user begins to settle into a Revit workflow. From there, he will explore some of the ìback of houseî tasks like creating templates, choosing appropriate settings, and dealing with a content library. He will show you how to set up the job before moving on to modeling the building systems. You will explore all the features and techniques needed to produce readable drawings efficiently and profitably. In short, this course will take you through the entire life of a project, allowing you to envision how youíll realistically apply Revit to your work. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>",
