    "description": "<p>  \t   This design course is intended for people with no background in design, as well as those who may be designers but would like to learn a new and simple tool that is accessible on the web.  </p>  <p>  \t   Canva was invented by a group of former Google employees. I am highly impressed with the interface and it&#039;s usefulness.  </p>  <p>  \t   Even if you are not a pro, you can start designing beautiful graphics in less than an hour!  </p>  <p>  \t   The only limit is your imagination.  </p>  <p>  \t   A well balanced design composition that is appealing can draw in more clients and customers as opposed to an unbalanced and unappealing ad which can actually make people feel uncomfortable and turn them off of your online products, or eBook.  </p>  <p>  \t   So it isn&#039;t just a luxury to have  well designed graphicsâ€”it&#039;s a need if you want to attract a bigger audience.  </p>  <p>  \t   Jump in now and let&#039;s get started! We&#039;ll have you designing like a pro in no time!  </p>  <p>  \t   Best of all- the Canva interface is free and accessible on the web from desktop and tablet.  </p>",
