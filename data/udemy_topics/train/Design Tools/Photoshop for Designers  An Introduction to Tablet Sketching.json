We are going to use the cube we create in this class as an example and add different textures to it such as wood, fabric and metal and I’m going to show you a trick that will speed up the process and make it look really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for you interest in my class, now let’s get started! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Marouane</p>",
