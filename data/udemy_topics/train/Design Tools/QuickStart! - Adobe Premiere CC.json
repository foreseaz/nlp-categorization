    "description": "<p>  \tPremiere Pro CC is the latest version of Adobe&#039;s professional video editing software. And with Creative Cloud, they have totally changed the way you access the software. So author Mark Struthers begins this VTC QuickStart! course with a quick overview of the changes and an explanation of how to access Premiere Pro via the Cloud. Then he dives right into project creation. He shows you what you need to know to quickly get up and running in Premiere from how to navigate and adapt the UI to suit your needs to exporting the finished sequence (and much more in between). This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>",
