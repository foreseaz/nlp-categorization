Muse is a new tool from Adobe that allows you to create professional HTML Web sites using familiar tools like those found in Adobe InDesign. With Muse, simply design your site as easily as you would create a print layout. This allows you to produce user-friendly, interactive sites that you and your clients will love. Never hand off your design to a developer to code a site for you again! But Muse isn&#039;t just for graphic designers--it&#039;s for anyone who wants to build and publish Web sites to the latest Web standards without writing code.<br style=\"\"></p>",
