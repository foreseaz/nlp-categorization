I'd like you to remove all rules and regulations about design and let your creativity flow free. In this class, we are going to give the blank canvas a purpose without holding anything back.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What will I learn in this course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn how to tackle a blank canvas. I know this can be intimitading, not knowing where to start. You will learn how to explore shapes using silhouettes, shading &amp; rendering with basic bruses, adding highlights, rendering and visualizing light such as LEDs and glowing surfaces and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will also learn the 3 tricks I use on most of my sketches as a final touch to make them look crisp like they're popping out of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure you download the attached .psd file and brush set used in the course!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for taking interest in my course, I hope to see you inside.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your instructor,</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Marouane</p>",
