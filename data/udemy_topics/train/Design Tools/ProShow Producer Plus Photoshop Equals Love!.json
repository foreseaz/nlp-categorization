    "description": "<p>In this course we'll be creating three unique effects that combine Adobe Photoshop and ProShow Producer.  You don't need to be experienced with either program, but you do need to own both in order to follow along.</p><p>First, we'll be creating a framed cutout in Photoshop that you can add your own photos to in ProShow Producer.  We'll animate the frame and photo and save it as a Slide Style that you can use again and again!</p><p>Next, we'll create a PNG embellishment out of a hand print and then add it to a slide in ProShow Producer.  We'll use Keyframing to make the hands appear to \"slap\" onto the photo!</p><p>Finally, we'll use Photoshop's cloning tool to create a multi-layer image out of a single image in Photoshop.  Then we'll animate both of those layers in ProShow Producer, creating a stunning depth of field effect.</p><p>After you've completed this course, you will be able to use these techniques, using your own photographs, to create your very own unique slide styles.</p>",
