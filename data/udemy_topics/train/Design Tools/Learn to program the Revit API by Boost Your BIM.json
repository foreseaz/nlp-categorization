    "description": "<p>  \t  This course is for people who want to do more with the Autodesk Revit building information modeling software.  </p>  <p>  \t  You can do a lot of great things with Revit as it ships &quot;out of the box&quot; from Autodesk, but there are still many tasks that are repetitive, boring, and error-prone. There are also many situations where you can be more effective and productive if you can add additional functionality to Revit.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will cover a wide range of topics in the Revit API. Each topic will be taught by walking through a set of C# code samples that progress from the basics to more advanced concepts.  </p>  <p>  \tMore content will be added to this new course in the upcoming weeks. If you see a topic that you like added, just let me know and I will try to make that addition.  </p>",
