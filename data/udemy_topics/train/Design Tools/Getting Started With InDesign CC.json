First, you’ll discover the InDesign interface and learn how to navigate through document layouts quickly. Then, you’ll see how to set up your documents, including how layouts need to be set for commercial reproduction. Next, it’s on to handling text, text frames, and how to thread text frames together. Then, you’ll see how to work with a variety of shapes, mix new colours, and import graphics into your layouts. Finally, you’ll see how to convert your layouts to static images and PDF documents for sharing with co-workers. All this and more awaits, so let’s get started!</p>",
