    "description": "<p>  \t  Autodesk Maya remains the industry standard for creating 3D content-- and with good reason!  Maya&#039;s robust and expansive toolset includes incredible modeling, UV layout, surfacing, lighting, rigging, animation, dynamics, and rendering tools. In fact, this toolset is so extensive and deep that many game and broadcast studios use Maya exclusively for all of their CG production needs. In this introductory VTC course, we will dive into Maya 2013 and touch on all of the different Maya modules by applying these tools to a series of fun exercises. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>  <p>  \tWork files for this course can be downloaded from the first lecture.  </p>",
