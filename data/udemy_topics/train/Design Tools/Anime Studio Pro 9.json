    "description": "<p>  \t <span class=\"GingerNoCheckStart\"></span>Animation can be an overwhelming process to learn, even with a user-friendly piece of software like Anime Studio. VTC is here to help! In this course, you will learn how to plan, design, and animate a cartoon. Starting with the very basics, author Chad Troftgruben will teach you how to outline, script, and storyboard your story. Next, he will demonstrate Anime Studio&#039;s basic tools and features, building your foundation for more advanced works. Finally, you will dive into the creation process by drawing characters and scenes, rigging bone structures, setting camera positions, incorporating dialog, animating sequences, and editing it all together. By the time you complete this course, you will be ready to finish the story we have started and even create your own original works! This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>  <p>  \tWork files for this course can be downloaded from the first lecture.  </p>  <p>  \t<span class=\"GingerNoCheckEnd\"></span>  </p>",
