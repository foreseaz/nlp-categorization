    "description": "<p>This lengthy tutorial series examines how to draw giant robots with vector art. You&#039;ll learn design principles (specific to stylized robots), texturing, shading, lighting and much more. All but about 10 minutes of the course is done using Adobe Flash. An optional Photoshop video is included to teach you how to make your exported image from Flash appear more like a hand-painted movie poster.</p><p>The course is divided into seven sections, the first three cover some of the basics which will be used in creating the final piece. The last four sections are entirely dedicated to creating the final project. Much of this is done in real-time (no speeding through significant parts), &nbsp;so you will have a real feel for what it takes to draw an epic robot.&nbsp;</p>",
