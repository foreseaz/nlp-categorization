    "description": "<p>  \tJump into the world of Dreamweaver CS6 and web design with this 7+ hour  hands-on course hosted by award-winning software trainer and designer,  Geoff Blake. First, Geoff will run you through the basics, getting you  comfortable in the Dreamweaver interface, working with documents,  defining new websites, and customizing the interface. Then, it’s on to  building a fully functional web layout from the ground up. You’ll learn  how to wireframe a rough design, insert navigation menus, and test your  work for usability. Handling text, graphics, and building a  well-constructed set of sitewide CSS rules to control it all brings your  site together; and Geoff even takes you through Photoshop and  Illustrator workflows, showing you how to get the most out of your  favourite Creative Suite applications. Then, you’ll see how to roll out  your site, and set and test hyperlinks; followed by a look at how to  integrate various page elements, including a self-running slideshow,  tables, a contact form, and a Google map. Finally, take your site live  by uploading it to a live web server, and test it across various  browsers on both the Mac and Windows platforms. Roll up your sleeves and  delve into this practical, task-oriented look at building contemporary  websites in Dreamweaver CS6!  </p>",
