This course will show you how to edit videos using Movie Maker.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t To illustrate the concepts, I made an actual short video of a trip I did in Mexico.  It&#039;s a compilation of videos I took at that time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t Watching this course and following along on Movie Maker will give you the skills to edit your own videos.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t I hope you find the course easy to follow and inspiring.\r\n</p>",
