Through my time being a photographer and working in the consumer electronic business I noticed something. No one really understands how to organize digital media. I also found that I was no good at it either. As I dove into the wonderful world of photography I though I would see this problem disappear. I would say to myself, &quot;These are professionals. They must handle their files efficiently.&quot; That mindset ended quickly as I found that most creatives have no mind for workflow. But they desperately wanted to learn it. So I set out to find the best workflow I could. This training course is it. It is all my research on how to work efficiently and effectively all rolled into one. It is The Perfect Lightroom Workflow.<br style=\"\"></p><p class=\"PIN_1372992651590_hazClick\" style=\"\">We work on a 6 STEP process:</p><p class=\"PIN_1372992651590_hazClick\" style=\"\"></p><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Import</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Select and Organize</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Normalize</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Creative Edit</span></li><li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Export and Convert</span></li><li style=\"\">Archive</li></ol><span style=\"\">In this course we will take you through all these steps and how make them work with your studio.&nbsp;</span><p style=\"\"></p><p class=\"PIN_1372992651590_hazClick\" style=\"\"><span class=\"PIN_1373161450537_hazClick\" style=\"\"><span style=\"\">This is not a course in all the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of Lightroom.
