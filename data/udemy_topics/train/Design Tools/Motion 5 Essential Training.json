    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tMy goal was simple for this training course â€“ create a spectacular  tutorial package and deliver it at an affordable price for everyone.   This is an HD video training course aimed to handhold beginners through  the Motion 5 experience.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis is the quickest and easiest way to learn Motion 5 in my opinion.  Books and manuals can be frustrating and slow.  From the first time you  open up Motion to when you put your project into Final Cut, I will take  you through the entire journey.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe course includes templates that you can customize yourself,  project files so you can follow along, and footage so you can practice  what I teach.  </p>",
