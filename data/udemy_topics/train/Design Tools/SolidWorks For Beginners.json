    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Welcome to SolidWorks for Beginners. If you&#039;ve only had limited exposure to SolidWorks, or even no exposure at all, you&#039;ve come to the right spot! This goal for this course is to walk you through a complete design in just an hour or two, and teach you the fundamental skills for creating Parts, Assemblies, and Drawings. We take an approach of assuming you have no experience with SolidWorks at all, and get you comfortable with the Interface, all of the picks and clicks, and try to give you a deeper understanding into Parametric Modeling. We also talk about something called Design Intent, and will discuss this concept quite a bit throughout the course as well. At SolidProfessor, we have found that one of the best ways to really reinforce what you learn here in the videos, is to try to do it yourself! If you don&#039;t have SolidWorks, don&#039;t worry! Take your time going through the course, and you can always come back and watch any lessons again later if you need a refresher. We hope you enjoy the course. Now go ahead and get started!  </p>",
