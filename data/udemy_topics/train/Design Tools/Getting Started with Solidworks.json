Once you&#039;ve learned your way around, you&#039;ll be taken step by step through the creation of a motor mount for a multi-rotor airframe. This course will include setting up your files for 3D printing, and you&#039;ll get the opportunity to see the 3D printer in action, as well as the final replacement mount!</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> Understand Sketches, Features and what they are.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Construction Geometry and using it to efficiently locate aspects of Sketches.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Automatic Rebuilding and invoking it manually.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Solidworks Magnifying Glass.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The Rollback Bar.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Centerline Behaviors.</strong></li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Understanding requirements and constraints during design.</strong></li></ul>This course requires only Solidworks. The 3D printing of the completed part is included to demonstrate the entire process from front to back but is not essential to completing the course.   At 2 1/2 hours, this course is designed to get you working in Solidworks as <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">quickly as possible.</em></strong> After an introduction to the UI and proper navigation, you&#039;ll complete a mini-project before tackling your motor mount. From there you&#039;ll work through the entire process from beginning to final printed component!   Take this course to get your feet wet with Solidworks <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">quickly and efficiently.</em></strong> This overview will take anyone with a basic familiarity in 3D or drafting from new to creating basic designs in just a few hours and is an excellent primer for more in-depth learning.<p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Start learning today!</strong></p>",
