Long-time VTC author Brian White examines Adobe&#039;s introduction of a subscription-based license to their products. He then explains the changes to InDesign including under the hood changes, feature enhancements, and the new QR code generator. He goes on to cover the InDesign/InCopy collaborative workflow which enables copywriters and editors to make changes to a document without altering the original design&#039;s integrity. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>",
