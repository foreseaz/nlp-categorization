When you have finished this course, you will have both a Kindle ebook and a printed book available for purchase on the Amazon store. </p><p>The course is structured on a simple step-by-step basis using screenshot videos. A supplementary ebook covering the same elements will be available to refer to offline. </p><p>I designed this course for novelists because the format of a novel is simple - a certain number of words divided by chapters. The insertion of images will be covered, but  If you&#039;re writing children&#039;s books with images and wrap-around text, or non-fiction, then this course is not for you.</p>",
