    "description": "<p>  \t <strong>Adobe</strong> revolutionized the publishing world when it introduced InDesign over a decade ago, and InDesign is now the publishing industry standard. However, its power isn&#039;t limited to producing print and digital magazines. It can be used to create virtually any type of material, such as collateral and packaging. With the release of Creative Suite 5.5, InDesign gained digital publishing capabilities built right in, for easier publication on tablets like the Apple iPad, and the Samsung Galaxy and other Android-based devices.  </p>  <p>  \t Learning InDesign is not optional. For the past several years, every working print designer has been expected to learn InDesign. With the explosion of digital publishing, mastering InDesign is even more critical. This InDesign course for beginners will get you up and running, and give you a solid foundation upon which to build your skills. Once you&#039;re done, you&#039;ll be able to build layouts that contain graphics and large amounts of text that flows between multiple pages. Lectures are shown in CS 5.5, but everything covered works in even the most current version of the software, which is <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external-link\">InDesign CC (Creative Cloud)</a>.  </p>",
