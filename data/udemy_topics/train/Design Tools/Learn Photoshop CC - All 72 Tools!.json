If you are like me you need to be hands on and see how things work. Prepare for the most extensive Photoshop Tool education on Udemy!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Who is this course for?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t          The beautiful thing about this course is that if you already know some of the more basic tools you can skip ahead and click on the ones you may not be as familiar with. Feel free to learn at your own pace or review as necessary. I have been using Adobe Photoshop for over 15 years and I still find myself learning new techniques. So whether you are a pro or just getting started this course will teach you something new.  </p>",
