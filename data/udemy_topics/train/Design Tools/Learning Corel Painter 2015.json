This course is designed for the absolute beginner, meaning no experience with Painter is required.  </p>  <p>  \tYou will start by learning how to manage layers, then jump into learning about the Painter desktop, including the toolbox, color panels, and menu commands. From there, Rhoda will teach you brush control basics and how to use cloner brushes. This video tutorial will also cover topics such as the effects menu, selection techniques, working with text, and dynamic layers. Other topics include auto-painting, smart stroke cloning, and the watercolor brushes.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course includes several projects to help you learn how to effectively use the tools in Painter, including creating a pastel portrait, a travel poster, an urban collage, and a caricature drawing. Once you have completed the course, you will be fully capable of using the tools and brushes in Painter to create your own digital artwork. Working files are included, allowing you to follow along with the author throughout the lessons.  </p>",
