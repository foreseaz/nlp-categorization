    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    Working efficiently in any encoding tool requires two levels of knowledge; First, you have to know how to use the program. Second, you must know the requirements of your target platform to ensure that your file plays optimally on that platform.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    In this course, you&#039;ll learn both. First, you&#039;ll learn how to use the Adobe Media Encoder as efficiently as possible, with multiple tips and tricks to maximize encoding quality and performance. And you&#039;ll learn the requirements of multiple target platforms, from general-purpose streaming, mobile playback and uploading to YouTube, to disc-based productions like Blu-ray and DVD.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    You&#039;ll learn that in some cases, the presets included with Adobe Media Encoder are spot on. In others, they need some adjusting to maximize quality, playback compatibility or both. In some very rare cases, you probably shouldn&#039;t use the Adobe Media Encoder to produce your files at all.  </p>",
