I have designed this training so that I can address many of the questions faced by business owners and non-technical types as they work to launch their own sites. </p><p style=\"\">We will review all the different sections that are â€œout of the box&quot; for WordPress. We will also review easy add-ons like custom themes, plugins, and widgets. Towards the end of training, we&#039;ll get into some basic customization that won&#039;t require much more technical knowledge than HTML and CSS.</p><p style=\"\">This course includes about 4 hours of video training sessions, plus various mini-eBook with the step by step content used in this training to keep as reference.</p><p style=\"\">I will also provide weekly &quot;office hours&quot; and, using the discussion board on the course, will help students through the setup and configuration of whatever theme they have installed on their sites.</p>",
