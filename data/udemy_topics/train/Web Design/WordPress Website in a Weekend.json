You can take longer if you like, but the course is designed to help you build your first WordPress website in only 2 days.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course starts with learning all the things you need to plan out and get in place before you build your website. Then it moves into setting up your domain name, hosting account, and then installing WordPress. The bulk of the training comes after that and shows you how to build out your site, add different types of content, and adjust the look of the site with no actual coding required.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will empower you to create your own website without having to hire someone else to do it. It also lays the foundation for you to start your own freelance web design business if that&#039;s what you want to do.  </p>",
