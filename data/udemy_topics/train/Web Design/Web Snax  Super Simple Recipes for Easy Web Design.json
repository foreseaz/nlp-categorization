Thanks!\" </em>-Shawn G. Miller</p>\n\n<p><em></em><em></em><em></em>Â <strong></strong></p><p>  \t<strong>      Are you ready to get a FULL web design foundation and overview (the equivalent of 12 power-packed smaller courses) all in one concise bundle from an artist and professor teaching web design since 2002 to hundreds of happy University students? </strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t            Use these bite-sized lessons to make your own website from scratch or learn how to  manage a website that someone else created for you.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t            Worried that you are too late to get started or there is too much you don't know? Online tools, software programs, coding languages, and methods change  or come and go, but <strong>a good web design foundation will stay with you no  matter which direction you go in or which tools you ultimately use.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t            This course will teach you best practice web design fundamentals that NEVER change (the way software programs change) along with several current and easy methods for creating beautiful websites. Learn at your own pace and in the order you choose. <em>Web Snax </em>is one giant, delicious resource that you can come back to again and again.  </p>\n\n<p> <strong></strong> <br></p><p>  \t<strong></strong>Most of my past and current students are artists, designers, and technophobes who now never have to pay anyone else to make their own websites, saving themselves thousands per year.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                                          Many have also gone on to start their own web design businesses or joined companies as well-paid web designers and content managers. <strong>If they can do it, so can you.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>This fun and easy to follow course was originally created in Nov. 2014 for my <strong>Web Graphics, Coding, and Site Design Students</strong> from <strong>The American University of Rome </strong>to use as a resource at the end of our busy semester and beyond. It's now open to the public, is constantly being updated, and has received glowing reviews from students all over the world.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t       In <em>Web Snax</em>, I draw upon my experience teaching web design on four continents to students from all walks of life and can show you how to create and manage your own website regardless of your personal software/hardware set up, resources, and budget.  \t<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                                             New lessons are continuously added, making this <strong>the most comprehensive online web  design course available </strong>and the best choice for right-brained, visual learners who are often intimidated by technology, software, and  the like and prefer to be <strong>taught in plain language from a fellow creative.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'm a  tenured Associate Professor of Digital Media and the Program Director of  Film &amp; Digital Media at <strong>The American University of Rome </strong>and a practicing award-winning multimedia artist.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                                                                          I have run my own charitable website, Aura's House that has raised over $100K for needy children in developing countries around the world.
