    "description": "<p>  \t       As an artist and musician, I learned how to create websites out of pure necessity. I am not a professional programmer - <em>I learned through trial and error and studying on my own what works and what doesn&#039;t work</em>. I&#039;ve now written hundreds of websites for artists, musicians, bands, galleries, and other organizations.  </p>  <p>  \t       In 2009 I created this class, &quot;Web Design for Artists&quot; as a class I teacher in-person around my area. The class has been very successful, and I&#039;m really excited to bring it to an online platform. My goal with this class is simple:<strong> I want all artists to have a website, be able to manage their website, and to never, ever, have to pay someone to do it for them.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This is a hands-on class: I am going to make a website for myself during this class, and walk you through every step. Nearly every video is a &quot;walk through&quot; on how to do something. And because I&#039;m not a technical web designer, we won&#039;t get bogged down with any abstract terminology - only what we need. Lets dive in!  </p>  <p>  \t<em><strong>Praise for other classes by J. Anthony Allen</strong><br>  \t</em>  </p>  <ul>  \t<em>  \t<li><em><strong></strong>&quot;&lt;/em&gt;Dr Allen does it again with his music theory for electronic musicians series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn&#039;t aware of.&quot; <br>  \t</em></li>  \t<em>  \t<li>&quot;The Best Teacher ever, who make you understand the in &amp; out Music Theory by all mean without giving what you don&#039;t want to know.&quot;<br>  \t</li>  \t<li>&quot;I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going thru this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.&quot;</li>  \t</em></em>  </ul>  <p>  \t<em><em>  &lt;/i&gt;  </em></em>  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  </p>",
