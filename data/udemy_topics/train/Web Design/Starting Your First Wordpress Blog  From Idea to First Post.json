In under an hour, I will take you through the entire process to get your first WordPress blog up and running.  </p>  <p>  \tWe will start by narrowing down your ideas and deciding which one is going to be the topic of the blog. We will then determine your domain name, hosting site, and even install Wordpress once we have purchased your site. This will all lead to a brief overview of WordPress and doing things like: Installing a theme, editing your basics info, understanding the difference between a post and a page, and even publishing your first post!  </p>  <p>  \tThis course will not turn you into a experienced web designer, but it will help you get your first blog up and running in a snap.  </p>",
