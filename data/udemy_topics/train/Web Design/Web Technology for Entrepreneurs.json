    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   This course will teach you the fundamentals of web technology. You will learn the major components and technologies that go into the design and development of large scale, high traffic web applications. At the end of the course, you will be very familiar with the tech vocabulary as well as all the different frameworks, libraries, and services used in building a modern web application.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course differs from many online courses since it does not spend any time on implementation. Other online courses are focused on coding tutorials, and although that can be great for users who want to be able to make something from scratch, it is impractical for others, especially entrepreneurs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIf you&#039;re still a little unsure about what exactly this course is, perhaps a little car analogy will help. We teach you how all the components of a car make it run, but we won&#039;t teach you what type of wrench you&#039;ll have to use to loosen a bolt. We teach the big idea, not the bits and pieces.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tAgain, this class is primarily geared towards those without technical backgrounds. Programming and the knowledge of how to program will not be necessary.  </p>",
