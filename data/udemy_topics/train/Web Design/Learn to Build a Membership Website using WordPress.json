Now you can with Wordpress.</p><p>This course  is a complete course for anyone, no matter what your technical ability. This course assumes no prior knowledge!</p><p>We'll start at the beginning, by choosing a domain name and setting it up to work with a web host.</p><p>Once Wordpress is installed, we'll login and have a look around to familiarize ourselves with the main areas of the Dashboard.</p><p>If you have some valuable content which you want to sell on your own custom branded website and earn money then this course is for you. </p><p>Everything used in the course is free apart from Domain and Hosting which is anyways required for any website.<br></p><p>I have designed this course in a <strong></strong>simple step-by-step but to the point fashion so anyone will be able to build their own website with no previous experience in shortest time.<br></p>",
