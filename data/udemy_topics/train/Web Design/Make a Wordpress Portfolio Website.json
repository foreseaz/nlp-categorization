    "description": "<p>In this course I will be teaching you how to make a wordpress portfolio website in wordpress. We will be using wordpress for several reasons. The first, and possibly the most important reason is because wordpress is free to use and easy to manage. Secondly, wordpress is a very powerful content managing system where you can integrate plugins to give your website amazing added features for absolutely free.</p><p>The course will be presented in a way that a beginning wordpress user can understand. I will go step by step through the setup process, which includes how to sign up for a hosting account with an affiliate coupon and how to register our domain name. After that we dive into installing wordpress and getting started with our portfolio website design. During this part of the course we build on one step to the next so it is best not to skip around.</p><p>I suggest that individuals who want to have or possibly improve their current online portfolio take this course. This is an outstanding way to not just showcase your work, but also a wonderful way to get noticed by potential clients, employers, and more. It's really an investment in yourself. This course can likely be completed in full in a few days. I hope to see you on the inside! If you have any questions before enrolling please feel free to reach out to me.</p>",
