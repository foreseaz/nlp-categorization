The course is structured into two categories. The first is to provide simple, yet sufficient, foundational knowledge about movement and running. The second is a complete set of drills and exercises along with a schedule for practical skill development. No other methodology about running has a standardized, systematic approach backed by over 40 years of research and practical implementation.
