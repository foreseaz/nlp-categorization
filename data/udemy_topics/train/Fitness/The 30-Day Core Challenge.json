They think about aesthetics. </p><p style=\"\">And while a good Core Training Program, can help you get great looking abs, Core Training is about more than getting a six-pack. </p><p style=\"\">A strong core means less risk for pain and injury and it also means you can lift more and run faster (and even do more pull ups and push ups). </p><p style=\"\">What many people also don&#039;t realize is that Core Training is about more than working your abs â€“ it is about strengthening everything from your shoulders to your knees. </p><p style=\"\">That is why in this 30-Day Core Challenge we will provide you with exercises and workouts that work everything from your shoulders to knees, including the muscles down your frontside and your backside. </p><p style=\"\">This 30-Day Course will even strengthen your glutes because your glutes are a key part of your Core and are often overlooked because people spend most of their time focused on working their abs with crunches. </p><p style=\"\">Our Core Program doesn&#039;t waste your time with crunches because a proper Core Training Workout Routine isn&#039;t about doing a million crunches. Crunches don&#039;t give you much bang for your buck. They don&#039;t burn many calories to burn the fat potentially hiding your abs and they don&#039;t strength many muscle groups at once to make you functionally strong. </p><p style=\"\">That is why in this 30-Day Core Challenge, we will provide you with a variety of Plank Variations, Hanging Core Exercises, Crunchless Core Moves and Glute Bridges to strengthen and tone your entire core.</p><p style=\"\">Get started today with our 30-Day Core Challenge Workout Program and build a stronger Core without crunches!</p>",
