Learn to use dumbbells in a smart and efficient way and make the most of your training, spending in just around 15 minutes per workout.</p>\n\n<p>This course teaches you 20 awesome dumbbell exercises and 10 high intensity workouts that you can do just about everywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don't waste your time on sitting around at the gym for hours. Grab two dumbbells and get the intensity on!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You get a video tutorial for all 20 exercises and also full videos of all 10 workouts, so you can work out together with the instructor. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why this course is better than many others? All workouts here are functional, full body exercises. Compared to traditional dumbbell movements where muscles are trained in isolation, exercises shown here are by far more beneficial for burning fat and increasing lean muscle mass. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Be ready for some jumping, pushing, pressing and snatching movements. You get your heart rate up while lifting moderate to heavy weights, so you'll be combining strength and cardio training in every workout. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
