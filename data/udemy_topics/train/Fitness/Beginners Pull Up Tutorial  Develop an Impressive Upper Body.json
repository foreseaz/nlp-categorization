Too many to list, but here are a few that are very important: </p><ul><li><strong>You get stronger</strong></li><li><strong>Your upper body gets bigger and more defined</strong> - sort of like the upper bodies of the ancient Greek and Roman warriors</li><li><strong>You develop the upper body muscles</strong> that will help you tremendously in other major exercises, like shoulder and bench presses</li></ul><p> I'm talking from experience - <em>I know how instrumental the pull up exercise was in my own physical development and my athletic career..</em> </p><p>Hi, my name is Ivan Nikolov and I teach this Beginners Pull Up Tutorial course. </p><p> I've spent over 23 years doing hard gym training and competing in natural bodybuilding competitions.
