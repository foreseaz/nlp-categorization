    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     Most of us are pretty smart and successful people in life.  We read, we work hard, and strive to make progress in our lives as we see fit. With all of that being true for whatever reason we simply can&#039;t stick to implementing a healthy exercise and nutrition plan for any extended length of time. There are just so many starts and stops that it is demoralizing. 65% of the population in America is over fat. More than half of that number is obese.  We pay the price of being busy and ambitious with our waistlines.  We settle for not enjoying the level of fitness &amp; health that we desire. We have less energy, foggy thinking, lower vitality, and have become open to so many chronic physical ailments and diseases.</p><p style=\"\">Many of us lose motivation after a few days or weeks around fitness?  You start out with the best intentions and then you get busy with life and before you even know it you have fallen off of the exercise bandwagon. You are back to eating whatever junk is convenient and the pounds are packed back on.  The  worst part of all is that once again we are a few pounds heavier and softer than before? Your energy is not as high as it should be? The mirror is not showing you the reflection that you want to see and you know that if you could just master consistency with your fitness efforts you you would be a lot closer to being that better version of you that you know deep down is inside. You&#039;d be a better human, a better father or mother, better employee or CEO, you&#039;d just feel better period know that you are realizing a higher potential.   You are smart enough to know that a healthier body and mind favorably impacts all that you do. </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t\t\t<strong style=\"\">&quot;Built To Thrive</strong> <em style=\"\">Maintaining a Fit Body In  Busy World&quot;</em> is the right course for you If you want to discover why fitness is an area of struggle for yourself or for so many others around the globe. It teaches people how to unlock the inner ability laying dormant in us all to make fitness and other areas of struggle that yield great reward stick as a priority that gets done consistently.  \t\t</p>  \t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\tThis course outlines the practical and psychological steps that can be quickly learned and implemented (in a matter of 5 weeks or less.) toward mastering internal motivation that us humans need in order to eat &amp; exercise the way that we know that we should. &quot;Built To Thrive&quot; bridges that gap between knowing what to do and actually getting it done.  There is a focus on who we are becoming on the inside both in our hearts and in between our heads.     \t</p>  \t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     &quot;Built To Thrive&quot; uniquely teaches students on a deeper level.  This course uncovers the thinking, doing and being that makes some people able to exercise  &amp; eat healthily without fail.  It also uncovers why others struggle and how to rewire the brain for fitness success. Simultaneous fitness/nutrition instruction are paired with personal development tools seamlessly in short videos.  They are combined with action modules at the end of each module for you to physically implement what was taught. The smart approach of training the mind, adding knowledge, and working the body simultaneously is what makes this work.                   \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet&#039;s face it we all intellectually know what to do when it comes to fitness. Staying the course and maintaining the motivation is the most common problem.  Making fitness a priority is the underlining problem that makes us fail with fitness efforts. &quot;Built To Thrive&quot; was designed by Andre Farnell to de mystify how people take charge of their fitness and nutrition in ways that are sustainable and enjoyable.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p style=\"\">  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                Fitness is the tangible form of personal development &amp; is marketed and perceived in a way that sets so many up for failure .  We are programmed to believe that we are one diet away or one cool exercise program away from realizing our best bodies in the mirror and adding to the quality of our lives. It is time for us all to see past the charade. We believe that &quot;If we can just find the time&quot;, or if &quot;I just get myself together and...&quot; or &quot;If I could just get this food thing under control&quot; &quot;If I had a personal trainer I would be fine&quot;.
