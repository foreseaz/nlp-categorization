These exercises are designed specifically to bring the most value to beginners. Now that doesn’t mean that this course is going to be a cake walk, quite the contrary actually. It will force you to <strong>WALK</strong> outside of your comfort zone. It’s not just going to be a step, but rather a commitment to <strong>WALK</strong> and stay awhile, hopefully forever. </p><p>Unknowing to most, actions come first and then you think. So stop thinking and start acting. You don’t need anything but enthusiasm to be prepared for this course. I challenge you <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> to be the boldest and strongest version of yourself. </p>    <p>I just hope that you say <strong>YES</strong> to yourself more often. </p>",
