It is one of the best calisthenics exercises there is. In fact, we show you some advanced variations of how you can incorporate the pull-up in a larger workout routine to train your full body from your legs to your abs to your upper body.</p><p>If you have ever wanted to be able to do a pull-up, but were never able to, we show you how to train to build up to a single pull-up and go far beyond that.</p>",
