You'll never have to put a playlist together again after this course.  You'll always be ready to teach any kind of indoor cycling class in seconds and have thousands of songs ready for your ride.  After this course you'll be able to find songs and edit songs for your class and never teach the same class twice. I designed this course for anyone interested in learning how to put together an indoor cycling class in seconds.  It contains song lists, song breakdowns, charts, audios and examples, so you'll feel like you're right next to me learning this course.</p>",
