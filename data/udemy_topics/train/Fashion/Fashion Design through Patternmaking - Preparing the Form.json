    "description": "<p>  \t    This is an optional class intended for students who want to see how the body is divided for clothing design.  If you have purchased a form or are considering buying one this class will teach you how to mark and tape the torso before you begin to work.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you have no need for a form you can skip this class and go directly to draping on a friend or family member.  Students who take this class will gain better understanding of how to divide the figure for garment design.  </p>  <p>  \tNote:  This is a how to demonstration that will walk you through steps of marking your form.  The class is presented in real time with moments shown in high speed video, 4 times faster than real time.  The high speed scenes allow you to see the process without skipping much of the process.  </p>",
