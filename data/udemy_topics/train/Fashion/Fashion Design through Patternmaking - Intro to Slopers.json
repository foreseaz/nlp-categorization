    "description": "<p>  \tAfter some consideration I decided to rebuild my course to include 1/2 scale examples of slopers and the garments they create.  This is presented in 1/2 scale and will introduce you to the three foundation sloper patterns you will learn to make in this pattern making  course.  The slopers are 1. the Five piece basic sloper, 2. the Torso sloper and 3. the Knit torso sloper.  This class also cover four basic variations of the Fitted waist dress (straight, A-line, flared, and added flare) and four variations of Torso based dresses (the Shift, the Chemise, the Semi-fitted sheath and the Sheath).  </p>",
