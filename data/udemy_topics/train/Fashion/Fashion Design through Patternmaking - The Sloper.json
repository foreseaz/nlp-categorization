    "description": "<p>  \t    This course will focus on the flat pattern method of fashion design.  We will be making patterns for non-strech garments. Designing clothing in two dimensions requires a designer to drape a 3 dimensional foundational garment that becomes a working sloper when deconstructed and presented as 2 dimensional shapes.  In this class you will learn to drape a custom foundation for any body.  After the garment is draped we will correct the shapes and create a perfected sloper. Draping a Sloper is a pre requisite toward fully understanding how patterns work. Moving forward in the course we will use our  slopers to explore the three major concepts of pattern making. 1. How to create shape. 2. How to create volume. 3. How to cut to the body.  </p>",
