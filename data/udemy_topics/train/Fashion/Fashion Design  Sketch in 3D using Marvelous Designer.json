    "description": "<p>This course is about being able to turn a flat drawing or sketch into real looking clothing using 3D software. You will get lectures that cover tool and concepts along with Marvelous designer files of the final output and textures used. I would however recommend to look around the web for your own textures for more creativity. This course is broken down into two projects. The first which is designing a Shirt will focus on using each tool and each video is dedicated just for that so that it is easier to reference if needed. The Second Project is the Pants. This project is broken into three separate videos. Third area of focus will cover animating your garment, import your own avatar, learning more about textures and exporting your garment images.<br><br>By taking this course will be learning about a tool that covers more than just fashion but it open up other industries like game and movies. You will be learning a skill where you can either save money for your fashion company or provide 3D clothing for your game characters. Â </p>",
