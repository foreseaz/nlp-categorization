This course will help you avoid all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Registration of your trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows you to <strong>obtain nationwide protection, sue in federal courts, and prevent other businesses from infringing your brand.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can also save money on not having to hire a lawyer. </strong>By taking this course, you don’t need to consult a trademark lawyer every time you need to check whether you will be infringing on another brand’s trademark. Knowing how to do it on your own will save you a lot of time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You've put a lot of time and effort into creating your business. Whether you're just starting out or you're already established, <strong>a registered trademark will help expand the protection of your brand nationwide.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>COURSE TOPICS</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>What is a trademark?</strong></li><li><strong>Who needs a trademark?</strong></li><li><strong>When should you trademark?</strong></li><li><strong>What can you trademark?</strong></li><li><strong>Risks of trademarking on your own?</strong></li><li><strong>How to conduct your own trademark search</strong></li><li><strong>How to Identify your goods and services and what class of goods and services your mark is to be registered in </strong></li><li><strong>How to file a trademark application on your own</strong></li><li><strong>Clear step-by-step guide through the United States Patent and Trademark Office trademark application so you can file a trademark on your own</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this course unique is that it’s a <strong>comprehensive course on everything you need to know about trademark law to help protect your business and brand</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t worry, it’s <strong><em>clear </em></strong>and <strong><em>simple</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Over 22 video lectures</strong> clearly explaining trademark law and step-by-step instructional video on how you can trademark on your own!</li><li><strong>Lifetime access, ask questions, and see the newest information available</strong> about trademark!</li><li><strong>Avoid paying a trademark lawyer upwards of $350 an hour</strong> for filing a trademark on your behalf!</li><li><strong>Quick actionable resources and links</strong> to help you trademark on your own.</li><li><strong>Ask me questions directly.</strong> I’ll be updating the content of this course based on your questions.
