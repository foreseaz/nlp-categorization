But in fact, the main point here is that whenever you launch a product,<strong> if you can control it from being pirated</strong> during the initial week, there are chances that <strong>you might see better conversions</strong>, increasing sales &amp; earning profits. This is because, if a user who wanted to buy your product, searches Google and if finds the link to your product which is free to download then that's it. You've lost a POTENTIAL SALE.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t <strong>                             Just <strong>spend 10 to 15 minutes of your time</strong> to <strong>search</strong> and <strong>remove</strong> the <strong>infringing links</strong> of your <strong>valuable product </strong>to <strong>increase your sales &amp; conversions</strong>.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t <strong> <strong><em>    This course helps you to battle against the copyright infringements and protects your earnings.  </em></strong></strong>  </p>",
