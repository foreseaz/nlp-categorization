    "description": "<p>  \t   This Business Law Course is intended to enlighten everyone about how business and the law intersect, and how business could not survive without the law regulating its operation. This course will focus on basic skills and knowledge sets that a first year law student would be subject to learning, but all jam packed into a simple and easy to understand course. This course is for beginners, and concepts will be explained in detail, with every step explained along the way. You will find video lectures, supplemental visual charts, quizzes for each section, and other helpful tools. The course may be completed over a few days, or over a few weeks. It all depends on how you choose to learn. The course is structured in a logical manner, with foundational knowledge taught before more complex issues are explained. You should take this course because you need to be educated on how liability issues will impact you in your personal and business life, and you will learn how to better protect yourself against the perils that will be brought with an ignorance of the risks associated with operating a business. I welcome you to this course and I look forward to our journey together.  </p>",
