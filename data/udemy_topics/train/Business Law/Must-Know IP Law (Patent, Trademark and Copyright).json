In fact, most attorneys do not have correct information when it comes to patents, trademarks, copyrights, business secrets, and other areas of Intellectual Property Law (&quot;IP&quot;).  If you have valuable technology, a product idea, or own any business, it is vital that you know the basics of IP so that you can know your rights and protect them, and avoid making very costly - but common - errors.  </p>  <p>  \t     We will cover the essential basics of:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Patents</li>  \t<li>Trademarks</li>  \t<li>Copyrights</li>  \t<li>Trade Secrets</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t     In addition, we will provide examples of common (and very costly) mistakes and misunderstandings surrounding IP Law.  </p>  <p>  \t     For 20 years, intellectual property litigator, Professor David Henry, has taught this course, both at Baylor University, and to fellow lawyers across the nation, and now he is making it available to you at a fraction of the tuition paid by students and lawyers alike.  </p>",
