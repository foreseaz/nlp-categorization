Seems like I was damn wrong!</p>\n\n<p>On Devdactic I have build a great active Audience simply by presenting my development skills and cool stuff regularly. I created my first online products and courses with nearly no experience and people bought stuff from me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That feeling!</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>People ask me how to do the same, because it feels like there is more than enough information out there already. This is true, but think about:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why are there countless books in a bookstore about the same topic? Why do people still write new cookbooks if there are already tons of them out there?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because there is space for your special point of view!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You have an unique voice, and people want to hear new stories, see new material and you can give it the spin it needs to become a success.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What you will get with Blogging for Software Developers:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Actionable advice how to find your blogging niche</li><li>Steps to create your own Blog</li><li>How to present your Software Development skills in the best way</li><li>The tools and best practices I used to build and grow my audience</li><li>The tricks I learned to make a blog successful</li><li>How to build your blog to a source of income</li><li>Building digital products and selling them without being a scam</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I wish this course existed back when I started, because I could have saved countless hours of trying to work things out.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Not everything people teach apply to all areas, and this counts especially in the Development area. There is certain advice that works, and other that doesn't. And I went for trial&amp;error, loosing countless hours on bullshit that doesn't matter at all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly the reason why I created this course:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blogging for Software Developers is a Step-by-Step guide to build a successful software development Blog which supports your career, income and life.</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>",
