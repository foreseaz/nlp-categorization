So, if you don’t get an offer for the next step from every interview, you were not able to showcase your value proposition by aligning your skills and experiences with the requirements of the role. </p><p>First, this course will show you how to find your own value proposition and this is a key to answering all interview questions. Then the course will break down the interview to <strong>10 most commonly asked questions </strong>and guide you how to structure your responses to those. <strong>Behavioural</strong> and <strong>Situational </strong>questions are covered, along with a set of <strong>questions to ask</strong> the interviewer. Finally, the course will guide you how to prepare for the day of the interview and help you build up confidence to face any job interview.  </p><p>After taking this course, you will be able to internalize the key benefits of coaching and interview preparation by gaining confidence to face any interview, insights of different types of questions and how to answer them and most of all inspiration to take the next step in your career. </p>",
