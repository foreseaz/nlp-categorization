You’ll be guided step-by-step through the entire process by BOB MILLS, an  experienced professional who has written jokes, sketches, speeches, song lyrics, and comedy routines for Dean Martin, Dinah Shore, Steve Allen, Bob Hope and a host of guests on their TV specials -- a seasoned practitioner of the comedic arts whose myriad assignments included writing serious magazine articles that appeared in national publications like the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> and <em>The Ladies Home Journal</em>. He is the author of <em>THE LAUGH MAKERS: A Behind-the-Scenes Tribute to Bob Hope’s Incredible Gag Writers </em>which recalls his two decades travelling the globe with Bob Hope as a staff writer.  </p>  <p>  \t          He is a firm believer that virtually anyone with a sense of humor (that includes almost everybody) can <strong>learn the craft of creating comedy by mastering the  elements necessary</strong> to inject funny lines in monologues, speeches, reports, articles, scripts, and song lyrics, as well as comic dialogue -- anywhere that laughter and wit are welcome.  </p>  <p>  \t          An instructor who was born to teach, BOB MILLS explains <strong>comedic structure</strong> in clear, concise language -- providing the student with the “nuts and bolts” of comedy writing that the old timers refer to as “laying pipe.”  </p>  <p>  \t          Through entertaining, easy-to-understand lectures, extensive analysis, hands-on practice, and by studying the <strong>hours clips included as additional resources exclusively available to the Udemy student </strong>of actual on-air performances of monologues, sketches, and routines performed by professionals, students will become familiar with a<strong> time honored craft </strong>whose genesis can be traced back to Vaudeville and English tab shows.  </p>  <p>  \t          In fact, by completing this course, the student will have learned so much about script writing, he or she will possess the skills needed to <strong>create laugh lines at will, and for any purpose</strong>, be it for a spec script for TV or just “punching up” a business presentation.  </p>  <p>  \t          From blank page to scripted performance, the student  becomes <strong>privy to comedy writing secrets passed down through generations of professionals </strong>dating back to Vaudeville!  </p>  <p>  \t          Course Summary  </p>  <p>  \t          Topics covered in this course (along with 4+ hours of video examples) include:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>    The History of Humor in America  </strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>English roots (tabloid shows, burlesque)</li>  \t<li>Vaudeville (W.C.
