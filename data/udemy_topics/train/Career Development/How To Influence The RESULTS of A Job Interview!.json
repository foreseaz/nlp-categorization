In this course, students will learn about the value of the Influence Letter as an interview follow-up strategy. The goal of this course is to teach students through step-by-step instruction, how to create their own Influence Letter template. Students can then use this template as a working document to update and submit to the interviewer after every interview they go on. A major feature of this course is the five months of unlimited feedback and review of their job application materials in addition to the proofreading service for the first draft of their Influence Letter. Additionally, this is a course designed to defeat procrastination through motivating students to complete the template by the end of the course. You should take this course if you are serious about doing every and anything you can do stand out, beat the competition, and get the job you desire NOW!</p>",
