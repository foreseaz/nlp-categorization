It assumes no prior knowledge or experience of CV writing, and will demonstrate how you can write a powerfully professional CV that will help you get your next job!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t The course is almost exclusively video based, but over time an archive of supplementary materials such as CV templates and other goodies will be developed which will be available to anyone irrespective of when they purchased the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t The course can actually be completed in a single day, and has been written based on the idea that you will be working through the process of writing your own CV as you learn.  Access to the course is permanent, so the videos and materials can be referred to again and again if need be.  </p>",
