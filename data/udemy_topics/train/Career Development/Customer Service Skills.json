Perhaps you're a HR partner, serving the employees by producing their pay checks and keeping the company running. Or maybe you're a CEO, serving your staff and your customers. </p><p>The <u>Customer Service</u> Skills training will examine all types of customers and how we can serve them better and improve ourselves in the process. You will acquire a valuable skillset including in-person customer service and over-the-phone techniques, coping with difficult customers, and generating re-occuring profit from return customers.</p>",
