    "description": "<p>This course is designed to inform prospective agents or anyone interested in learning about the landscape of the business, the processes to attain certification, and the process of recruiting athletes and preparing them for the NFL draft. I cover the agent’s role, how to attain professional certifications, and fulfilling state and school requirements in the recruiting process. Once agents have met these requirements, they need to know HOW to recruit. I share some thoughts about the process and then how to best prepare clients for the NFL Combine or his Pro Day. Lastly I share how to service clients and discuss lessons learned that will save agents time, money and heartache. I don’t talk about veteran recruiting as it outside the scope of this course. </p>",
