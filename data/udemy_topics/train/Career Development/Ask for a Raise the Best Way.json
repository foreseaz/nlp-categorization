The course combines video mini-lectures (you gain knowledge) with activities (that help you use the knowledge) to improve your own circumstances.  Along with the video coaching, you will want to invest half an hour several times thinking, planning, and rehearsing your “ask.”  The potential payback is great; it is worth doing it well.  </p>",
