Seeking a change of career? </p><p>Applying for a job can feel like you&#039;re just sending resumes off into cyberspace, never to be seen or heard from again! Gone are the days of pouring over classified ads for work openings in your local area. New recruitment tools and apps allow agencies to run their listings in hundreds of online locations at once. That means job banks today get inundated with applications from people worldwide! People apply to jobs across the nation or across the world, ready and willing to relocate for that “perfect” job. And that means hundreds of qualified candidates to choose from but a much more challenging process to actually choose! </p><p>So after the electronic “scrub” of parsing, who will be left standing? Don&#039;t you want to be one of them? This course will help you learn to analyze job announcements and answer the question the hiring agency is asking – with a targeted resume!</p>",
