The latter is what makes this training unique, there is a strong emphasis on Awareness and Mindset training. The goal is to EMPOWER participants with strategies, awareness and mindset so they become self reliant during the interview process, not solely depending on a robotic system of &quot;interview DOs and DON&#039;Ts&quot; that someone can find just about anywhere.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><u style=\"\">What people have said about my training in the past: </u></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t&quot;Just like that I switched my whole mindset Arman.
