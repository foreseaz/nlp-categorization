    "description": "<p>The interview is your gateway to a job and/or career.  Interviews are your ONE chance to: (1) Explain how your past experiences have prepared you for the job; (2) Explain the value you can provide to the organization, and; (3) Explain why YOU are the best candidate for the position.  Interviewing is something that doesn't come naturally to most, but I believe it can be mastered through knowledge &amp; practice.  In this course, I will walk you through what you need to know to be at your best and will provide examples of great (and not so great) resumes, cover letters, and interviews that focus on tech careers.  I have created this course because I deeply care that every candidate deserves the opportunity to show off his or her best attributes in a technical screen or interview.</p>",
