I've interviewed at big companies like IBM, Caterpillar and Amazon, and small unknown companies. I've interviewed at the world's largest winery and the world's largest contractor. I've even interviewed with many global consulting firms including A.T. Kearney, Deloitte, and Accenture.</p><p>But I've also reviewed a lot of resumes so I have experience on both sides of the table. In this course I'll share with you what I've learned in my experience, and the things I've seen give a lot of other people success. And I've reviewed other folk's resumes so you can see common mistakes from people with all different backgrounds, all over the world, and avoid the same mistakes on your own resumes!</p><p>I want to see you improve your resume and get more interviews! </p><p>. </p><p><strong>Why not take the course today and get a head start on all your peers who are trying to get the same job you are?</strong></p><p>-<em>Andrew</em></p>",
