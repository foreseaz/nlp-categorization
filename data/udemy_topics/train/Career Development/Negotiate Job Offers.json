Because we’re either afraid to ask or don’t know how to. In this class you’ll learn what questions to ask and how to negotiate when you’re offered your dream job. Asking for what you need affects your entire time at that job, not just the beginning. By taking this class, you’ll have the tools and resources to reap the benefits at your next job offer!</p>",
