    "description": "<p>This course is Week 8 of an 8 week series that teaches electronics to professionals, students and hobbyists desiring to know how electronic circuits work. This first 8 weeks has the name \"DC Electronics\" in most college electronics degree programs because it teaches the following concepts about electronics:</p><p>- The atomic structure of conductors, insulators and semiconductors</p><p>- The definition of the major characteristics of electronics: Resistance, Current, Voltage and Power</p><p>- The use of Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Voltage and Current Laws, the Voltage Divider and Current Divider Formulas and how to apply them to basic resistive circuits.</p><p>- Practice solving series resistive circuits, parallel resistive circuits, and the topic for this week's class: solving series-parallel resistive circuits.</p><p>The class is presented primarily as a PowerPoint presentation with instruction by your teacher.</p><p>Quizzes are presented at the end of each section of the course to test your knowledge and comprehension of the material presented in that section. <br></p>",
