This is why it's so important for you to be assertive at work.<br><br>|In this course I will teach you how to assert your position by venturing into the unknown and making use of opportunities at work. <br><br>You will learn how to capture peopleâ€™s attention and convey your point of view by using the right verbal and non-verbal communication. <br><br>I will show you how to provide feedback to others properly and how to react to nasty criticism, without losing your self-confidence and self-control.</p>\n\n<p>And more!<br><br>Remember, there is no risk involved.
