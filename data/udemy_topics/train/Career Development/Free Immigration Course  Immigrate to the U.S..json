    "description": "<p>There are multiple ways to immigrate to the United States. This class discusses the experience of my clients, The MBA Student Professional Immigrant Model. This method starts with being a MBA student, obtaining funding for the education, and a model of career strategies both during and after graduation. Because there is so much uncertainty, I have also included the alternative strategies that my clients have used to reduce stress and increase certainty.</p>This course is specifically written to professionals that have a Bachelor’s degree holder, in any profession, that wants to immigrate to the United States as a Master’s student. Technically, this model is the same for any Master’s degree but MBAs are my specialization.<p><br>I will be discussing and introducing general Visa concepts. Because I am an Executive MBA career strategist and coach, and I am not an attorney, nothing in the class can be construed as legal advice.</p><p>Professionals and students that wish to immigrate to the United States \nneed both a career and a legal plan. </p><p>My focus in the class \nis the career part of the process.</p><p>However, I periodically host an immigration \nattorney to discuss the legal aspects of the process.</p><p>In addition, the \nattorney can also play a big part in the career side of the \nequation.<br></p>",
