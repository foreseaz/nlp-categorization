Confident and credible? Believable and trustworthy? Engaging and knowledgeable? Now consider how you prepare. If you're like most people, you'll spend most of your time grinding out PowerPoint visuals but here's the disconnect. Nearly all the perception words you might come up with will always have more to do with how you are delivering your message. That's right. People will most often forget your words but they'll remember how you delivered them.</p><p style=\"\">In this 30 minute course we'll start by discussing the elements of making a solid first impression (because those matter!). We'll unpack four foundational skills, discuss their significance, talk about the science behind what's going on, show you a demonstration of the skill, and give you several practical tips and methods to developing the skill when you're preparing for your next meeting. </p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Relevant.
