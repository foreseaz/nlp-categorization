    "description": "<p>Preparing for an interview takes <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">a lot more than Googling a list of common interview questions</strong>. You have to make a great first impression, you will have to have a great knowledge of your target company and its product, and, of course, know exactly how to convey that you're the perfect fit for the job.</p><p>There is<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> no one “best” way</strong> to prepare for an interview. Rather, there are <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">specific and important strategies</strong> to enhance one’s chances for interview success. Every interview is a learning experience. Learning that takes place during the preparation and actual interview process is useful for future interviews<br>The interview is one of the most important elements in the job search process. When an employer invites you to an interview, he/she is indicating an interest in bringing you on board. The interview gives both of you the opportunity to exchange enough information to determine if you are a good \"fit\" for each other.<br>The <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">biggest mistake in interviewing is not being fully prepared</strong>. It behooves job-seekers to use every conceivable means possible to prepare for the interview and to allow ample time to fully prepare.<br>Understand that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">interviewing is a skill</strong>; as with all skills, preparation and practice enhance the quality of that skill. <strong>Preparation can make the difference</strong> between getting an offer and getting rejected. You should use the limited amount of time you have to learn about an employer's needs and discuss the ways you can meet these needs.<br>Think of an interview as a highly focused professional conversation. In many cases, you will interview at least twice before being hired for a position. Once in a brief screening interview and at least once again in a more serious meeting when you may also speak with many of your potential co-workers.</p>",
