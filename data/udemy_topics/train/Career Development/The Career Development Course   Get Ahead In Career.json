    "description": "<p><strong><em>Goal Setting:</em></strong></p><p>If you really want to make a success of your business, it's important to define your business goals, especially before you get started. For some people, the goal is the freedom to do what they want when they want, without anyone telling them otherwise. For others, the goal is financial security.</p><p>Setting goals is an integral part of choosing the business that's right for you. After all, if your business doesn't meet your personal goals, you probably won't be happy waking up each morning and trying to make the business a success. Sooner or later, you'll stop putting forth the effort needed to make the concept work.<br></p><p>The most important rule of goal-setting is honesty. Going into business with your eyes wide open about your ultimate goals lets you confront the decisions you'll face with greater confidence and a greater chance of success<br></p><p><strong><em>Time Management:</em></strong></p><p>If disorganization is congesting your life and as a result you're feeling scattered and frustrated, then it's time to get organized. To achieve organization outside, you have to do something on the inside, like clarifying your priorities, and deciding how you want your belongings to be arranged. Try to keep stuff where it belongs. Know what you need/want to do, when you are going to do it, and avoid the stressful situation of not knowing what needs to be done. Organization takes time, but when you get into the habit of it, life becomes so much easier! It only takes a week to start a habit.<br></p>",
