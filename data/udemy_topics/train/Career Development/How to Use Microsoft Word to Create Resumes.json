    "description": "<p>A good resume template can really help you streamline your resume and keep it organized and professional without taking up a lot of your time. It helps you to stay structured and consistent and present your experience and achievements in a way that is easy to follow and understand.</p>\n\n<p>Using templates without making any changes is a bad idea – you will end up with a generic resume that won’t help you stand out from other job applicants. Instead of using templates as a ready-made solution, use them to guide your inspiration, and create your own, one-of-a-kind, resume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, we will teach you how to use basic, intermediate, and some advanced features of Microsoft Word to modify and customize resume templates. We will address most common issues people usually experience while formatting resumes, and we will show you, step by step, how to solve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to customize different resume templates by using various features of Microsoft Word, to create your own attractive and effective resume.</p>",
