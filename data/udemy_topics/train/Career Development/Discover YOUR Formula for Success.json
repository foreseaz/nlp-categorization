In the words of Lewis Carroll, “If you don’t know where you are going, then any road will take you there.”  </p>  <p>  \tUnfortunately, most people spend more time planning their vacations than they do planning their lives. So, it should be no surprise when things don’t turn out the way we hoped they would.  </p>  <p>  \tTrial and error is also an expensive way to build a business, and to meet your goals and fulfill your dreams in all aspects of your life.  </p>",
