In this course, you&#039;ll learn the ins and outs of how to use humor at work.  </p>  <p>  \tUsing humor in the workplace can help you:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><span>Relieve stress and increase overall workplace happiness.</span></li>  \t<li><span>Improve office morale and build trust among team members.</span></li>  \t<li><span>Deliver more effective presentations and influence people.</span></li>  \t<li><span>And make work more pleasant and fun.</span></li>  </ul>  <p>  \tDespite these powerful benefits, less than 1/3rd of people use humor at work regularly. Maybe you don&#039;t think you have the time or just don&#039;t have any ideas. Or maybe you&#039;ve tried it before and it didn&#039;t go so well. Or you&#039;re afraid you won&#039;t be taken seriously or you&#039;ll say something inappropriate. Or maybe you&#039;re shy or introverted and don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s part of your natural personality.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course will help you overcome those challenges and teach you everything you need to know about using humor at work.  </p>  <p>  \tWhether you already use humor and just want to be more intentional, your team has no humor and you just want to help people loosen up, or you&#039;ve never tried humor at all, you&#039;ll learn the necessary skills to bring levity to the office. You&#039;ll learn:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><span>How to use humor in different situations and how to &quot;know&quot; your audience.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to confidently present your humor.</span></li>  \t<li><span>When humor is and isn&#039;t appropriate, what subjects are &quot;off-limits,&quot; and how to avoid saying anything inappropriate.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How use humor effectively without being seen as a clown or a jester.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to incorporate humor on a regular basis so that is has a positive impact on the culture at work.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to teach other people about the benefit of humor so they can embrace it as productivity tool.</span></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What This Course is Not</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is all about using humor to be more effective at work. This course is:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><span>NOT a course in stand up comedy. You will learn about basic joke structure, but the course will not cover things like how to create a set list, the business of stand-up, or how to get on the Tonight Show.</span></li>  \t<li><span>NOT a course in humor theory. We do touch on basic humor theory, but you will not learn that ins and outs of what makes us as humans laugh.</span></li>  \t<li><span>NOT a course in zombie apocalypse survival strategies, although I do mention it.</span></li>  </ul>",
