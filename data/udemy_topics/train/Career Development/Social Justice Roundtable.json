    "description": "<p>The Social Justice Roundtable promotes participants to engage in meaningful exchanges around anti-oppression and social justice issues as they relate to the working and living experience of interpreters and those they serve. The forum serves to support those who are members of marginalized groups and to educate participants on issues of oppression, discrimination, and social justice. Participants will have opportunities participant in discussions, network with others, and learn from current events. We acknowledge that there is room for improvement both culturally and structurally within our society, we value involvement of people of diverse backgrounds within our field. The Social Justice Forum hopes to facilitate political and social awareness, gather varied perspectives, pass on positive images of discussions, and make the interpreting field more inclusive for future professionals.<br><br>This was a live-streamed presentation from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf National Convention in New Orleans, 2015.<br></p>",
