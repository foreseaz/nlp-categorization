You will have the opportunity to follow and critique Jewel Jamison’s career search, you’ll check your recall intermittently with “Quick Tips”, and through on-going writing exercises you will create the narrative for your Professional Profile. Feel free to work with a tutor or coach, and hone your skills by contributing to the Discussions section with like-minded people.  Divided into six sections, you can work at your own pace, repeat sections where needed, and articulate your discoveries through the written word, a valuable asset for any professional. If you&#039;re ready to enter the workforce, don&#039;t think &quot;job&quot;, think career. This course will help you focus and cultivate that which you were meant do - live your calling! </span>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>",
