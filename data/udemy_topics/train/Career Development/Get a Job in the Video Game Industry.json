    "description": "<p>  \t         Tens of thousands of gamers want to make a living working in the video game industry.  But there are not many jobs available, and it&#039;s a lot harder than playing games or getting ideas.  There are entire books published about &quot;breaking into&quot; the game industry.  </p>  <p>  \t        In this course you&#039;ll get the essence of what you need to know in a couple hours.  </p>  <p>  \t     Note: This course is <strong style=\"\">not</strong> part of Udemy&#039;s periodic deep discount sales.  </p>  <p>  \t Student comment from the exit survey:  </p>  <p>  \t &quot;I&#039;m making sure I know the basics around the industry and what is required so that I don&#039;t make a foolhardy decision to jump into something too quickly and in an unprepared way. For others in the same position, this is valuable preliminary information in one place from an authority, rather than searching around online for the information in bits and pieces from different sources (which is fine, too, as well as free, but takes a bit more time and discernment). Thanks!&quot;  </p>",
