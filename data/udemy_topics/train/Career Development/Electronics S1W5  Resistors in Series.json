The analysis of basic series circuits is a fundamental tool that you must master to properly troubleshoot, analyze and maintain electronic equipment. Ohm&#039;s Law states the basic relationships between voltage, current and resistance in an electronic circuit. This information is mandatory for any hobbyist or professional who needs to understand how electronic circuits work. This course is a quality product taught by a college instructor who has been teaching electronics for over twenty years. It is the equivalent of a full week of college level training at a community college or technical university.<p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">The primary teaching method is instructor led lectures using PowerPoint slide presentations. Drawings, images and schematics are used to clearly illustrate each electronic principle. There are ten separate lectures that take you through the concepts of Ohm&#039;s Law and series circuits in a clear, simple manner. A number of quizzes are included test your retention of the lecture material.</p><p style=\"\">At the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of the principles of Ohm&#039;s Law and the application of this law to the solution of electronic circuit problems.</p>",
