Courses that don't address the big challenges around this skill and how to beat them.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to take a risk and make something crazy. You'll see what I mean when you watch the intro video.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In this course:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>You'll learn the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">CORE</strong> techniques and tricks you need to build the foundation of good public speaking. Go from novice to good.</li><li>We'll talk about your <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">STYLE</strong> and how to inject that into your public speaking to connect with audiences and win at engagement. Go from good to great.</li><li>I'll deep dive into <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">CREATIVITY</strong> so we can talk about pro tips you can pull from all sorts of advanced forms of public speaking. Go from great to awesome.</li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>This course is a wild ride of weirdness, authenticity, and comedy. You'll laugh, you'll think, and I hope you'll come out the other end with not only new knowledge but a new mindset as well.</p>\n\n<p>Grab a seat, get some popcorn, and buckle up - it's going to be a ride.</p>\n\n<p>-Nathan, Billy and Chad</p>",
