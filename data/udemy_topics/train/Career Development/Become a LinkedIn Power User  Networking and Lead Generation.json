Too many people hop onto the platform and get overwhelmed or frustrated with low results and too much time wasted. This course is designed to teach you how to become a &quot;Power User&quot; on LinkedIn and how to reap the benefits it can provide.  </p>  <p>  \tMy company, Hosskey Consulting, uses LinkedIn as our top referral source for new clients (over 75% of our clients were generated from LinkedIn introductions). This course is going to show you how I use LinkedIn on a daily basis to expand my network and find new prospect. I will be sharing my tips, tricks, and advice on how to connect with the right people, build the relationship, and make your life easier.  </p>",
