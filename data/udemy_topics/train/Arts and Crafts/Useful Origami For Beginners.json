    "description": "<p>If you love crafting and making useful objects this origami course is for you! I have combined origami fun and usefulness to make your time with family and guests more pleasant. You can get the kids to do an origami frog race next time or you can surprise your guests with an elegant napkin utensil pouch at your dinner table. You will learn what kind of paper you will need and how do the correct folds to make the models work. In almost 1 hours of lessons, you will make 8 origami models. You will learn to make the following origami models: a paper cup (for drinking water), a utensil pouch (a nice way to display your napkin, fork, spoon and knife), a sanbo (a small square box for storing small party treats such as m&amp;ms), lazy Suzan (a rounded box for table decor to keep candies ), a masu box (for keeping jewellery), a jumping frog (for racing), a bookmark, and a lily (for decorating tables or walls at parties). Each lesson is very easy to follow and only takes a few minutes each time. At the end of the course, there is a simple quiz of 4 questions to test your understanding of the course.</p><p><br></p>",
