    "description": "<p>This course is all about helping you unlock your inner creativity and discover ways to make your watercolor painting unique. If you struggle with painting loosely in watercolors let me show you how to loosen up and have some fun creating interesting watercolors that leave things for the eye  to interpret. I will do two demonstrations of the same subject - one leaving some white space on the paper and one covering the paper entirely, and leave it up to you as to which you prefer. At the end of the course I also will include a few videos on interesting ways to create texture in your watercolors that will help you become a more creative artist. We are only going to use three colors for this course, which will  create harmony in your work. </p>",
