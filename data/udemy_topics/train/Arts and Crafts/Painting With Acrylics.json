    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tThis &quot;Learn To Paint&quot; (with acrylic) art course, using a reference photo, is taught by professional artist and art teacher (Masterpiece Art School) Cristian S. Aluas. A materials/supplies list is provided at the start of the course, listing economical options for students. The instructor talks about choosing your subject, if other than the reference photo he is using (or you can use the photo he uses, which is also provided) and he discusses composition theory. This course also features a couple of clear videos on colour theory and acrylic painting techniques, outlining how to use your brushes and how to achieve desired techniques (like gradients and blending). What follows is an easy-to-follow series of video lectures, geared toward art students of all levels, where the student can follow the instructor as he paints a dancer on a canvas (from the reference photo). Students can follow along with the same subject or just watch and learn from these short and engaging videos and then undertake their own painting project. This experienced instructor takes a fun and casual approach, aiming to make acrylic painting very accessible to any and all students that are looking to learn a new medium or gain a fresh perspective into this popular trend of painting realistically with acrylic paint!  </p>",
