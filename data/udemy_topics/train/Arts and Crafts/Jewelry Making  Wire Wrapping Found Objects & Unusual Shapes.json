    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t       This course has been created for weekend jewelry crafters who want to learn how to wire wrap found objects, gemstones, or rocks. Unlike traditional metalwork, wire wrapping does not require caustic chemicals or fire. You can even design and create a pendant while sitting on the couch as long as you have a lap desk. It takes less than a 1/2 hour to create a unique piece of art.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Wire wrapping is a wonderful way to use your newfound jewelry making skills to supplement your income. You can sell these new art forms at craft fairs, local boutiques, and online. Every piece will be one-of-a-kind. Don't be afraid to charge wholesale at 10 times what it costs to create these pieces of jewelry. Unlike basic beaded necklaces, these items will appeal to the buyer who wants to own something unique and not easy to duplicate.  Even though the pieces are unique, the techniques are easy to master within one day.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course has a full 30-day guarantee. If you are not fully satisfied, Udemy will refund the full cost of the course. So, please enroll today. You have nothing to lose, and a new skill to gain!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course was last updated with a new wire wrapping technique on 12/26/2014.  </p>",
