For this purpose, superficial points are established that describe the size and appearance of the planes that compose this essential element of the face.</p><p style=\"\">In this course, the student will learn the fundamental principles of drawing that are not generally taught today. These principles were included in a class called &quot;Procedures,&quot; which was common the Academies of Beaux Arts. The purpose of the course is to develop basic abilities, such as the training of the eye and hand; the knowledge and correct use of working materials; the study of 3D, geometric figures (solids); and his/her individual development as well as other basic concepts of drawing - grisaille, value studies, tone and temperature.</p>",
