    "description": "<p>This is a basic approach to figure drawing. This entire tutorial is 3.5 hours.  I share techniques that I have used over the years to create comic book illustrations and storyboards for television.  You will learn how to systematically break down the various parts of the body into simpler shapes.  As I illustrate each area step by step you will follow along and learn from my studies.  This will give you insight into how I create my artwork and create poses from the mind.  I also share what techniques I use to improve my knowledge of the human form.  Things like gesture drawings, timed studies of the pose, negative space drawing, foreshortening, perspective, organic versus angular lines, and much more.  You will also be given a copy of the art files that I have created here so that you can work along and study from them.  By the end of this course you should be more confident in constructing your figure drawings from the  mind and have a better understanding of the human form.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>The tips and tricks from this course will make the process of drawing complex body poses much easier to accomplish.  Good luck with your art!</p>",
