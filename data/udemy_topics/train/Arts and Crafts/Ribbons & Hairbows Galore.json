    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   Welcome to Ribbons and Hairbows Galore here on Udemy! I am so glad you have joined me to explore a few of the many options for making cute and stylish hair accessories. Often, these can be quickly and easily made at home for a fraction of the retail cost, and the projects themselves are so much fun that it may just serve to satisfy and &quot;arts and crafts&quot; craving that overwhelms you at times. Throughout the course, we will explore several different ideas to get you started, ranging from casual &quot;play day&quot; bows to bows suitable to adorn a darling little flower girl at your next family wedding. (Also included is the practical hair bow organizer -- sure to be Mom&#039;s favorite!) Each lecture provides step by step instruction, and clear video footage, so that even the most hesitant beginner can learn with ease. My goal is to equip you -- no matter what your past experience or skill may be -- with the knowledge you need to create accessories for your own families, for gifts, or for an on-the-side entrepreneurial venture.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   So, grab your ribbon, scissors, and creativity, and prepare to have a blast! Let&#039;s get started!  </p>",
