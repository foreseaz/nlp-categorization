You don't have to settle anymore.</p><p>Learn how the cone relates to the thread guides, relates to the running speed, relates to the bobbin tension and more...whether you machine quilt with a traditional machine or a long arm machine.</p>\n\n<p>This course was conceived at Houston Market when everyone was complaining about their machines and how bad they were.

Especially when you are about to use your sewing machine for a boat anchor.</p>\n\n<p>This course was designed so beginners and advanced quilters alike could run all the threads, not just the boring ones.
