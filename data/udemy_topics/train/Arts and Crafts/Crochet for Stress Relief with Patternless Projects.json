There are also instructions for 4 different crochet projects, with variations, that include additional instructions for binding off, edging, turning corners, crocheting in the round, changing colors, and creating a granny square.  Learn to make four beginners projects from start to finish: a pot holder, scarf, afghan, and drawstring bag - all at your own pace!  </p>",
