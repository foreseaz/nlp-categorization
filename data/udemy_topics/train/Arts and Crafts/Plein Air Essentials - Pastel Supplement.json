If you&#039;ve taken the Plein Air Essentials course and are a pastel painter, this is for you!  You&#039;ll watch a series of videos on pastel, pastel painting and pastel painting en plein air, all of which will give you a good look at what it takes to go pastel painting out in the field.  You can view the videos and learn everything you need in an afternoon - or you can take as long as you like to practice and experiment with the methods shown.  </p>",
