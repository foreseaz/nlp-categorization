    "description": "<p>This course will cover the uses of Sketchbook Pro 8 for drawing and  coloring your comic book character faces.  It will cover how to draw the human face by starting with basic forms and working up the design of your character from there.  You will learn how to rough out a face and then refine the line art.  We will then finish the process by adding color and effects to our illustrations. By the end of this course you will have a strong fundamental knowledge of how to construct facial drawings and a better understanding of the tools within Sketchbook Pro 8 that help with this process.  We will go over using layers, brushes, selection tools and many other great features of this powerful program.  Do you want to improve your ability to draw interesting characters?  Then this course is for you!  </p>",
