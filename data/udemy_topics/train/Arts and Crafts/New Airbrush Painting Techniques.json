If you’re looking to spend years of your life to learn techniques everybody already knows then move on. <strong style=\"\">This class can teach you something VERY different, VERY powerful.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You’re going to learn all about the breakthrough airbrush painting techniques that will <strong style=\"\">transform the way you airbrush forever!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      The kind of airbrush artist who can <strong style=\"\">improvise a whole painting in just minutes</strong> as a hobby or for a living.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      These techniques come from a small group of street painting artists in Mexico. They figured out how to speed paint space scenes, landscapes and much more with spray cans.  I learned from the original spray paint artists of Mexico and I have adapted the techniques for acrylic painters who do not wish to use spray paint.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This class will teach you how to do spray paint art techniques with regular acrylic paint.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      I cover:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to set up your studio.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to mix your paints.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Different papers and surfaces you can paint on.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to prepare canvas for using these techniques.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to use common household materials to create incredible effects.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to speed paint pyramids and a galaxy.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to speed paint a sunset with palm trees and clouds.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to speed paint a gorgeous wave.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to use newspaper as a brush.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to paint planets.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to speed paint mountains and land.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      How to use these techniques on metal, for example on cars.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      And more!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      If you do not already have a compressor, you will need to purchase one to learn these techniques.
