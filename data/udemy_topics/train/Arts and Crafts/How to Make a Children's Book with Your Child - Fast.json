    "description": "<p style=\"\">I recently published a book to Amazon and it hit the best seller list in several categories. It was a great experience. My 5 year old daughter has been making her own books with her art and practicing writing out the text. She has several and they could be considered a small library of her own work. I wanted to work with her on a fun project so I took my knowledge of my recent publication and decided to combine it with her desire to create books. I suggested we work on a book together and publish it. </p><p style=\"\">The entire experience has been so rewarding I decided to share the knowledge in a course so that other people can have the same experience. </p><p style=\"\">Amazon has several tools to make creating a children&#039;s book easy. So easy in fact it can be done in an afternoon. I walk you through the process and show you how to publish your book with your child in a matter of hours.</p>",
