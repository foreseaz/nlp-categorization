    "description": "At the end of this course, we have a beautiful, final masterpiece \"Birch trees\" to be proud of. I would love to see your paintings that you have created!<br>•This course provided step by step instructions, so anyone can learn basic watercolour techniques and develop their personal skills in future paintings. <br>•We reviewed tools of the trade such as watercolour paper, paints and brushes. The most common watercolour paper is cold pressed because it gives a nice surface texture to paint on. In this course, Watercolour paints come in either tubes or small pans. Brushes are made with Natural hairs, synthetic or blended. In this course we used only two types: round and flat.<br>• The Bonus lecture introduced basic colour theory. Students were able to create their own Colour Wheel and see for themselves the magic of secondary colours appearing.<br>• This course was especially made for beginner students to encourage them to pick up a brush and have fun by 'doing'. <br><br>Happy Painting<br><br>Bev",
