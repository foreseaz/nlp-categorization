Then why don't you join me to learn how to write in a simple Gothic Script ?</p><p>In this series of videos, I will  </p><ul>\n<li>show you how to insert the nib into your holder ;</li>\n<li>give you some hints for get the ink to flow from your pen ;</li>\n<li>talk about letter weight and proportion ;</li>\n<li>teach you about those oh-so-necessary guidelines ;</li>\n<li>tell you about the ductus (the strokes that make up a letter).</li>\n</ul><p>After that, you will learn how to </p><ul>\n<li>draw each letter of the alphabet, first the lowercase letters, then the uppercase. The letters are not demonstrated in alphabetical order; they will be presented to you in groups of similar letters ;</li>\n<li>plan and execute a project with a short text.</li>\n</ul><p>You will see me using traditional pen-and-ink in these videos (a 3 mm Brause nib and walnut hull ink), but of course you can use calligraphy markers or cartridge pens with a calligraphic nib instead.</p><p>The upsides of doing calligraphy are numerous. For example,</p><ul>\n<li>you will learn to create beautiful letters. Creating beauty of any sort is a wonderful thing to do ;</li>\n<li>calligraphy is yoga-for-the-soul. In doing calligraphy, you set aside some time for yourself, and you will feel great for it ;</li>\n<li>calligraphy contributes to neuroplasticity â€”which basically means that, while teaching your (old) brain new tricks, you are  creating new pathways in your brain and paving the way to sharper neurological skills.</li>\n</ul><p>Aside from the videos and presentations that make up this course, several downloadable documents are included (practice sheets, letter reference sheets ...).</p><p>So grab your pen and paper, and come along with me on this calligraphic journey!</p>",
