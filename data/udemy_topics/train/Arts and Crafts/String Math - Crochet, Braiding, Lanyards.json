    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is about understanding the underlying processes in crochet, braids, and lanyards.  By studying the theory behind these arts we will learn how to better manipulate and create projects.  Students do not need a background in crochet, braiding, or lanyards; though I would reccomend it.  I do recommend that you know your basic mathematics functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, area, and slope.  We will be using these skills to create patterns of our own.  The course contains over two hours of content covering the theory, stitches, patterns, and quirks of crochet, braiding, and lanyards.  There are four projects over the course of the class a hat, afghan, bookmark, and DNA lanyard.  The course is broken up into three parts crochet, braiding, and lanyards.  Each section covers theory first, then stitches, patterns, and finally the final project.  I recommend taking this course if you wish to better understand crochet, braiding, or lanyards.  This course can help those who have struggled with crochet, braiding, or lanyards.  It can help those wishing to make patterns in these arts understand the rules and logic by which they function.  This course is for all who desire to make beautiful art with string.  </p>",
