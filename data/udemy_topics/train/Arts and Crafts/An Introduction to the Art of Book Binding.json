Book binding terms, materials and resources will be discussed as well as book arts communities and events. This course is perfect for anyone with a desire to make things. Hand made books are great for gifts, self published art or literature, journaling, sketchbooking, scrap booking, and much more! The art of hand made books is a meditative, fun and rewarding process that I believe everyone could benefit from being exposed to.  </p>",
