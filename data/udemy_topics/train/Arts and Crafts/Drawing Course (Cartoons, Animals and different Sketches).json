    "description": "<p>Welcome to this course . <em>Drawing made simple. Its a good starting point on ways to draw for the kids, this gives a good opportunity for your child to follow or a parent/guardian to follow and then show the kids.</em> The teaching process used is a kid-tested, step-by-step method that will both inspire and delight your child into drawing action! The process involves organizing shapes and lines together until a recognizable outcome (in this course, usually a cute cartoon animal and Birds) is achieved. Young artists may then apply the knowledge they gain through each lesson to create unique masterpieces of their own. The <em>Drawing for Kids </em>course is designed to give young children the tools they need to begin their artistic journey into self-expression, reflection, and creative thinking.</p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>",
