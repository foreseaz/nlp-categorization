    "description": "<p>Essential Drawing is an eighteen video drawing course meant to give students a foundational understanding of drawing practices. The two main goals of Essential Drawing are to teach drawing skills through the <em>elements-of-art</em> and to cover the major approaches to drawing that have stood the test of time. You don't need a lot of expensive art supplies to get better at drawing - just paper, a pencil and an eraser. If you have a brush and black watercolor paint you can use that too. If you want to improve your drawing skills, or if you draw well but want to learn a variety of methods to add to your bag of tricks, then this course is for you. A reference image accompanies many of the video lessons so that you'll have no trouble following along. </p>",
