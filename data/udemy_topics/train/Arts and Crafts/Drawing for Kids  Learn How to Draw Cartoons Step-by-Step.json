Its a good starting point on ways to draw for the kids, this gives a good opportunity for your child to follow or a parent/guardian to follow and then show the kids. </em><em>My Daughter loves you Em, I showed her your tutorial and she just cant stop (this is not a Joke). I cant give you more stars but I can say thanks for making a very simple to follow program.</em></p><p><span></span></p><p>~G.F.</p><p><strong><em>This course was updated in February, 2016!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Would you like an experienced teacher guiding your child through the drawing process?</strong> The <em>Drawing for Kids </em>course may be just what you are looking for! Designed with beginners in mind, this drawing course is perfect for ages 5-10 years old. The teaching process used is a kid-tested, step-by-step method that will both inspire and delight your child into drawing action! The process involves organizing shapes and lines together until a recognizable outcome (in this course, usually a cute cartoon animal) is achieved. Young artists may then apply the knowledge they gain through each lesson to create unique masterpieces of their own. The <em>Drawing for Kids </em>course is designed to give young children the tools they need to begin their artistic journey into self-expression, reflection, and creative thinking.</p><p><strong>I would love to hear from you.</strong> </p><p>Please let me know if you have questions, comments, or suggestions. I will get back to you ASAP.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor:</strong></p><p>My name is Miss Em and teaching art to children is what I love to do! I pride myself on creating dynamic, meaningful, and engaging art lessons that are taught in a relaxing and joyful way. I have nearly 20 years teaching experience in the elementary classroom and in the art studio, and I feel that I have a good grasp on how to create an environment that makes children feel happy, motivated, confident, and successful.</p><p>I look forward to seeing both you and your child in this <em>Drawing for Kids </em>course. </p><p><strong>Let the creative fun begin!</strong></p>",
