    "description": "<p>This course is an introduction to card making tools and techniques.  It will cover popular trends and fundamentals.  Digital stamping is really big now and this course includes digital stamps for students to use.  The list of materials is basic but versatile, so you can continue to make beautiful cards after the course is completed. This course explains tools and techniques before assembly of the final cards begin. The course covers making 3 cards; this can be done over the course of a weekend if the student has the required materials. You should take this class if you have ever wanted to gift someone with a handmade work of art, to stretch your creativity, or if you want to get into paper crafting, but don't know where to start.</p>",
