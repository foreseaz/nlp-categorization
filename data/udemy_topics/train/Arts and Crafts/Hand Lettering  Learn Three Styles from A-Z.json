    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This fun and super simple hand lettering course will help students take their overall art to the next level and introduce (or underscore) the concepts of drawing letters by hand. Using only simple, everyday materials that you probably already have around the house, once you complete this course, you will have created not one, not two, but three entire alphabets from A-Z in three distinct lettering styles: graffiti, block, and bubble! Also, you will learn how to create words with these letters and add awesome special effects to each lettering style. If you want to be able to create hand-made cards, posters, imagery, or art for sale or to give as gifts to friends and loved ones, then this is the course for you!  </p>",
