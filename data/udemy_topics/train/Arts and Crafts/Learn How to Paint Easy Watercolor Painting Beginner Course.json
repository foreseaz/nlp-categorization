    "description": "<p>BEGINNER WATERCOLOR COURSE - Learn to Paint this Maine Lupine Scene</p><p>Have you ever wanted to take up watercolors, but found most classes are too heavy and academic? These classes are similar to a Paint Night but we use watercolors. The classes are Easy, and no basic knowledge of watercolors are needed. You can usually finish your first painting under 2 hours. </p><p>This course is simple and minimal materials are needed to start painting today. Use any watercolors or brushes you have on hand, but I'll give you my favorite supplies and a PDF list to go by.</p><p>The course is broken down into small easy steps and I'll paint along with you. If you have questions as you go along please feel free to send me a private message or ask openly on the discussion board.<br></p><strong></strong>",
