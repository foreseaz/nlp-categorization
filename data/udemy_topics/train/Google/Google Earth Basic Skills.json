    "description": "<p>This course is covering basic skills using Google Earth.  Students will learn how to navigate, turn, zoom, pan and swivel around the globe.  The course also highlights where a student can find basic data about elevation, depth, coordinates, etc.  A quick exploration of different layers available to Google Earth users will also give them a taste of the capacities of the program.  </p><p>This is a basic course, so very basic knowledge of geography, software and hardware technology is necessary.  </p><p>The only thing that students need to complete the course is the Google Earth program downloaded and installed.  No textbook, no external links, etc.  </p><p>The course should take 2 to 4 weeks to complete at a leisurely pace.  However serious students could tackle it and digest it in a couple of days.  </p><p>This course is ideal for students who have just discovered Google Earth or those who have known about it but never dared to explore it.  This is a simple and gentle guided tour of the Earth.</p><p> <br></p>",
