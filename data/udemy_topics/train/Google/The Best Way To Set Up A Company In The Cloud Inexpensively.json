    "description": "This course is to show people who are uncomfortable with online software or the cloud how easy it is to actually get your entire company set up (from nuts to bolts) on the cloud.    Also, there&#039;s a TON of information on the internet about software. So you can spend your own time doing the research, or just take this quick course and we&#039;ll show you the most inexpensive yet most useful software to use to save you significant time and money so you can focus on what you do best, sales, marketing, hustling your business....not administration.    Now you can work from anywhere in the world and have access to all your company&#039;s information at your fingertips, all you need is an internet connection. This quick course is a series of videos that shows you (starting with Google Apps as your base) which software to choose and how easy it is to sign up with them to get you started. This is NOT a training video on each software, this is a video course that shows you what we selected as your best options for the specific software you&#039;ll want to use to handle ALL your company needs while at the same time costing you only $5/month to run!    Enjoy!",
