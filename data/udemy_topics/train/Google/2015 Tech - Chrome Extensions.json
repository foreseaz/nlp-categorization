    "description": "<p><strong>Chrome Extensions</strong></p><p>During this Chrome Extensions video training course, you will review some popular and useful Extensions. Browser extensions can add a great deal of functionality to a browser. Because Google allows anyone to easily post an Extension in the Google store, there are a great number and variety of extensions. Google does review and scan extensions for viruses and malware before they're listed in the Google store.</p><p>Although this course is designed for anyone, there are a few extensions covered that might goes into some advanced concepts such as SEO numbers. Users are encouraged to skip through the lectures to find sections &amp; extensions that appeal to them.</p><p>It's highly recommended that you already have Chrome installed prior to the course, most devices already have it and it's very easy to install, just Google â€œInstall Chrome\".</p><p>This is a supplemental course to Chrome and I kept it short. Udemy requires courses to be at least 30 minutes long.</p><p>There is a brief video introduction and several video sections, they are followed by a recap, a short quiz and a documents section at the end which has a copy of the slides and a few additional materials.</p><p>This course includes a quiz and certificate of completion.</p><p>This course was made in high-definition and is best viewed with the DH setting on and with the videos enlarged. Feedback is a critical part of an online course. Once you have completed the course, providing comments helps improve the course and benefits everyone, so let me know what you think.</p>",
