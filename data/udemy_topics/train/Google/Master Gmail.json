You can customize the app to your personal style and have it perform tasks for you! First, learn the basics of composing, formatting and inserting attachments, links, photos and emoticons. Then, quickly master advanced features like stars, importance markers, labels, filters and labs. Discover little known features like last activity and other hidden gems! In the Contacts section, you will manage the people in your world and communicate more efficiently with groups. Finally, uncover the bonus apps: Hangouts expands Gmail to include text, voice and video! Tasks mange your to-dos and Keep is the place to create and store notes. All this in Master Gmail! <br></p>",
