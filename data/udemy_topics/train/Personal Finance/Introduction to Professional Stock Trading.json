    "description": "<p>The course is designed to help people understand how to view the stock market like the Wall Street professionals, and teaches the same skills/techniques that professional assistant traders receive during their training at some of the top Wall Street firms. The information is considered proprietary and is not commonly known by anyone outside of the experts. </p><p>The course will provide a deeper level of understanding regarding common strategies (that don't work) and what strategies you need to know in order to become a profitable investor. It teaches game theory, probabilistic thinking, and fair value - as well as, how to make positive expectancy trades to increase your success.   This is the first of several courses and there is no requirement to take or understand the material in this course.**This course includes the first set of lessons from the Wall Street Preparatory Academy's Introduction to Stock Trading course. The remaining two sections will be added over the next few weeks. Students will be able to receive weekly updates and announcements by turning on  the \"New Lecture Emails\" setting. ** </p>",
