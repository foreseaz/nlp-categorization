Also you have a pdf version of the Powerpoint used in the lesson for quick access to the lesson highlights.</p><p>When my first marriage fell apart in the early 2000&#039;s, I did not know where to go to get help. And because everything was so private, I did not want to tell people about the fights and arguments about money and other issues. So I suffered in silence until it became overtly public.</p><p>This course was designed with a lot of that pain in mind along with the lessons learned from my life, my wife Gina, my clients, and the bible.</p><p>If you want to get on the same page with your finances, improve communication, increase joy, and deepen the joy in your relationship. Marriage and Money is the course for you.</p>",
