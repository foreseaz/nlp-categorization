    "description": "<p><strong>Be A Wizard of PayPal, All The Way To The Bank.</strong></p><p>Anyone doing business online knows about PayPal. They know that you can send and receive money online using PayPal, and that you can integrate it into a website. In this class I'll cover those basic things, but I'll also cover what most people don't know: That PayPal has a long list of professional tools that <strong>you</strong> have access to, without paying a dime.</p><p><strong><em>**UPDATE**<br>Over 1200 people already have taken this course and are making money using these secrets of PayPal!</em></strong></p><p>Did you know that you can <strong>offer gift cards to your products</strong>? Did you know that you can <strong>setup subscription payments for your products</strong>? Did you know that you can let your customers <strong>buy a high-priced item and pay it off over 6, 12, or even 24 months</strong>? And (most importantly) that you can do all of these things at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>?</p><p>All of these features, and many, many, more are included in a PayPal account - if you know how to access them and use them. I've been using them for years, and I've grown my business exponentially by doing so.</p><p><strong>Why You Will Never Find Another Class Like This</strong><br></p><p>No one will make this class, and for a very good reason: In order to produce this content, I had to film the inside of my PayPal accounts - revealing all my customer names, my account numbers, and personal information. Yikes! But I really wanted to make this class, so I've painstakingly gone through and put a black box over all that information. So you get the benefit of seeing inside my accounts, but I still get to protect the information of my customers. This took months - but I know the payoff is worth it.</p><p>For years I've been teaching this material in the college classroom. As a University Professor, my classes are sought after, and, frankly, expensive. I believe you can learn in a way that cost isn't a barrier. This class uses the same outline and syllabus I've used in my college classes for years, at a fraction of the cost.</p><p><strong>BONUS: <strong>Sign up for this class, and get any of my other classes for only $9! Details at the end of the course!</strong></strong></p><p><strong>You will not have another opportunity to learn the hidden details of PayPal in a more comprehensive way that this.</strong></p><p><em>J.

It leaves you enough room to go explore. The classes go by quick, so you can be on your way at being proficient. What are you wait for!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Amazing - Seriously Loved It! I took all his courses and have to say I'm so happy! Learnt loads! Jason is an awesome teacher!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I have never had any formal training in music at all. Trying to learn all the notes and how everything translated was a serious challenge. After going through this class, Dr. J has totally brought down the barriers. The content was very useful and was easy to grasp for me.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I like these courses because you can get up and running quickly without having to spend hours of time wading through TMI (too much information!). Jason hits the high points but shows you what you need to know. Thanks!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"I've watched many other videos on scales and chords before, however, this one has been the best. I now understand minor scales and chords and even how to analyze songs. It really gave me the confidence to start producing music because I feel like I have some structure and guidelines to follow. AWESOME!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Clear and Informative - Jason has a clear uncluttered style (with the important dashes of humor) of presentation that is focused on the important key aspects of this course. Recommended for those starting out!\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"Dr. Allen does it again with his music theory series. This course really opened up everything I learned from the 1st section, and now I understand more about the composition side of things for music. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone!!! Really opened my eyes to many things I wasn't aware of.\"<br><br></em></li><li><em>\"The Best Teacher Ever, who makes you understand the ins &amp; outs of Music Theory by all means without giving what you don't want to know.\"</em></li></ul>",
