And why is it so important?”</p>    <p>Instead of letting your dollars sit, you can put them to work, earning more for you. $10,000 invested in a long-term, low-risk strategy today could be worth $217,000 in 40 years. But the longer you wait to invest, the less time it has to grow.</p>    <p><strong></strong><em>Investing for Beginners</em> is meant for anyone who is thinking about saving for the future, but doesn't know how. You’ll learn about stocks and bonds, indexing, mutual funds and ETFs, taxes on investments, and retirement accounts. By the end of the course you'll know not only what those things are, but how they work and how to use them. You’ll set your own investment strategy that will hopefully benefit you for the rest of your life.</p>    <p>There are 15 lessons and quizzes, which will take you less than an hour and a half to complete.</p>",
