    "description": "<p>Students emerging from a year or two of elementary Latin grammar often feel overwhelmed by the real Latin authors that mark the transition to intermediate Latin. A popular, and excellent, 19th century reader, <em style=\"\">Fabulae Faciles</em>&nbsp;was designed and perfected over many years to bridge this gap. I have used these stories for years for my own college-level Latin students as independent study materials over the summer which typically separates elementary and intermediate Latin.</p><p>In this class, I cover the first reader in the <em style=\"\">Fabulae Faciles</em>, by providing audio files, guided study, supplementary materials, and, more important, a constant and consistent presence as you work you way through the passages.</p>",
