    "description": "<p>Over the years of teaching  Latin from the excellent and justly renowned textbook &quot;Wheelock&#039;s Latin,&quot; I  have created a series of lectures designed to help students to learn Latin online and get the most of this magnificent book. In them  you will find guidance to some of the more perplexing concepts of grammar --  English and Latin -- that often comprise an insuperable barrier to progressing  in Latin for modern-day students. The lectures will not replace the Wheelock  text. They will only, I hope, make your on-ramp smoother. To that end, the  lectures track exactly with the chapters of the textbook. This will give you  &quot;context sensitive&quot; help when you need it.&nbsp; </p><p>You will not find answers  to the exercises or anything that is copyright protected by the publisher of  the Wheelock book. To get any benefit from these lectures, you must have the  Wheelock text.</p><p>A typical college-level  class will cover the first 15 chapters in the first semester; a high school  class will cover them in the first year.</p><p>Take this Learn Latin Online course  now and learn Latin with Wheelockâ€™s Latin chapters 1-15</p><p>Best of luck to you!</p><p>              </p><p>-bl</p>  ",
