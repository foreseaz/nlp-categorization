The goal is for you to understand the fundamentals of RPG design (which is a subset of game design). For example, what are you really doing when you \"design an RPG?\" There are at least three parts to that.</p><p style=\"\">The three main sections are an introduction to game design (mainly \"Need to Knows\"), an introduction to RPG design, and a discussion of the business of RPG design. The primary purpose of the last is to help you understand why RPG design, especially tabletop, is very unlikely to earn you a living.</p>",
