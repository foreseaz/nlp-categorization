We'll also build our specular map to ensure our surfaces read like metal and offer nice detail and contrast.  </p>    <p>  \t<strong>About the Instructor:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Alec Moody has been working in the game industry since 2003 and has contributed to numerous titles as a freelance artist.
