    "description": "<p>In this series, your instructor, Steve Curtis is going to demonstrate how to harness the power of Photoshop to get beautiful 2D art work for games, even if you&#039;ve never created art before. This is High-Rez art designed to look like modern graphics but with that old school feel. Although it isn&#039;t pixel art, the graphics created could certainly be sized down to create art that has that pixel art feel. This course uses Photoshop, however GIMP and similar programs should suffice. No tablet is required, all of the art in this series was created using only a mouse. <br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">We will create beautiful cartoon art with a modern edge, and harness light and shading techniques to give our work depth.</p>",
