We'll start by modeling a sword in Maya, show the unwrapping process, and take you step-by-step through creating the hand-painted stylized textures for both a sword and a shield asset.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong><br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>  \t <u><strong>About the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t   Tyson Murphy attended the animation program at Brigham Young University.
