Translating the 6.5 hours of videos to words, it's the size of a small novel (more than 50,000 words).  To my knowledge, there is nothing approaching this size on this subject in existence.</p><p>Playtesting is the heart (though not the brains) of game design. If you want to be a good game designer, not just a hack, you have to understand that heart just as you have to understand the brains, as covered in my other courses.</p><p>The major sections cover:</p><p>What is Playtesting?</p><p>Arranging the Playtesting</p><p>How to Conduct Playtesting</p><p>How to use the results of Playtesting</p><p>Other Considerations when Playtesting</p><p>There is nothing here about game programming, art, sound, etc. It is all about game design.</p>",
