His workflow covers various tools within the editable poly modifier such as edge extrusion, beveling, and slice planes, as well as the use of individual modifiers such as free form deformation lattices and symmetry to make the process easier. In addition, he will also cover the importance of smoothing groups while modeling, as well as make use of the kitbashing technique while reusing some elements that he has already created.  </p>  <hr style=\"\">  <p style=\"\">  \t<u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">More about the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  Stephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.
