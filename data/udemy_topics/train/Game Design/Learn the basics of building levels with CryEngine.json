Not only will we hit the ground running with a basic look at the UI, we'll also be covering how to realistically and logically place objects in a level so that the scene makes sense and flows effortlessly. We'll also be covering how to light and add additional compositing effects, and finally to wrap things up, we'll add particles for some additional environmental realism. If you've ever wanted to get a jump-start with building levels in CryEngine, this course is for you!</p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>Emiel Sleegers is a self-taught 3d artist currently residing in the Netherlands.
