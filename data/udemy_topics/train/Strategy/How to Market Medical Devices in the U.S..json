This pathway provides marketing clearance and the ability to sell your medical devices in the U.S. Before sales can occur companies have two options: 510(k) Premarket Notification (unless exempt); or Premarket Approval (PMA) approval. PMA’s are resource intensive, and so 510(k)’s are the ideal submission type. </p>    <p><strong>Areas Covered in the seminar:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>U.S. FDA medical device methodology </li>  <li>Class I, II, and III devices</li>  <li>How to identify Class I, 510(k)-exempt      devices</li>  <li>The three types of 510(k)’s </li>  <li>510(k) determination - new; and      substantially modified</li>  <li>Intended Use statement – key insights</li>  <li>How to locate predicate devices</li>  <li>How to interact with the FDA</li><li>FDA Review timelines  </li><li>Post-submission review<strong></strong></li><li>Common questions by the FDA</li><li></li></ul>  <p><strong>Who will benefit:</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>Executive Management</li>  <li>Product Management </li>  <li>Engineering </li>  <li>Regulatory Affairs personnel</li>  <li>Quality Assurance personnel</li> </ul>",
