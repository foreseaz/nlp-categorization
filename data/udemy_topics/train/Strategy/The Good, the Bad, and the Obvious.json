This timeless literary gem provides wisdom and insight that still has much to say to us today.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe premise of this course is that in our rush to employ technology and &quot;systems&quot; to guide us through and around personal and organizational challenges, we have lost sight of what should be our primary navigational tool -- obviousness!  </p>",
