Since then, book sales have taken off and technology vendors have come to me asking for Quadrant Coaching. I put together this course from the book and have delivered it to marketing teams at major technology companies. I cover the importance of your positioning in Gartner&#039;s MQ, How to create an objective strategy. How to use social media to influence analysts. How to conduct briefings, inquiries, analyst days, and events. And finally, some Guerrilla techniques of analyst influence.  </p>",
