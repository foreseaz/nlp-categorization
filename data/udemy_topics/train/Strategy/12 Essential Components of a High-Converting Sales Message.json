    "description": "<p>It makes me extremely sad when I see business owners and authors who works their ass off and struggle. You put in very hard work just to sustain and make a few sales. But you only create the 90% of the essentials. And because of that missing 10% critical components, you lose the 90% of your results in sales, growth, fulfilment, joy and especially: control in your business.</p><p>There are too many noise and too many distractions. Let's say you just launched your first product. What's next? Focus on your blog? Start guest-blogging? Create YouTube channel? Go for social media spend a whole week to try to figure out how it works? Focus on SEO and shady link-building and get more visitors? Focus on paid traffic? Focus on self-publish your book on Kindle? Or create your next product? Or create Autoresponder sequence? </p><p>Extremely overwhelming, especially if you're a start-up or you just released your first product and you try to figure out things alone. You don't even know where to start and what are your next steps.</p><p>I remember when I started my first start-up in Budapest and failed very soon. I tried to do everything at once, generating sales, delivering the service, accounting, whatnot. </p><p>I didn't sell enough to sustain the business. I was overwhelmed. I had no focus. No strategy. No life. I had no control – actually the Main Thing I started my business in the first place.</p><p>You might be in the same situation. You don't sell enough because you probably focus on the wrong things. The main obstacles are information overload, lack of focus on what really matters. In other words, you don't have a strategy and enough sales.</p><p>You might hear of the Pareto Principle. </p><p>Only 20% of your activities will give the 80% of the results you want. As soon as you focus on what really matters and only on what matters, you get breakthroughs after breakthroughs.</p><p>Your strategy and your sales materials are the 20% of the 20% what really matters in marketing. This is why I created Copywriting Crash Course as my first product.</p><p>That's why I created a very short, immediately actionable course on how to build high-converting sales pages.</p><p>My name is Zoltan Gero and I was working for the #1 daily deal of Budapest as an Email Marketer. I sent out dozens of millions of emails every single month which generated few millions in revenue. I'm not a millionaire or a big guru. But I've studied good old copywriting for more than 2 years now, read few books and I compressed the essentials into 1 short guide and 1 short PDF.</p><p>But you don't need to spend long hours with reading marketing books. And you don't need to test millions of emails to see what works and what doesn't.</p><p>I want to keep you extremely productive. </p><p>By productive I mean you get the results you want – and more importantly – get the joy and fulfilment and control what you deserve. </p><p>By extremely productive I mean you get these results shortest way possible by focusing only on essentials.</p><p>Unlike the massive guru programs, Copywriting Crash Course is very intense, immediately actionable and clear like a step-by-step execution plan. You can finish the course and create a high converting sales page in just 25 minutes, in under 1 Pomodoro.</p><p>If you already have a product to sell, improving sales page is the number 1 priority to sell more and get more money from what you already have. </p><p>If you don't have a product yet, creating an offer and a sales page even before you create your product is the most effective way to keep yourself focused on what really creates value for your clients.</p><p>You'll know what to focus on a sales page. If there's any missing component, you'll instantly know what's your next step, how to fix it, and you'll transform your sales page into a high-converting one.</p><p>I understand if you don't want to become a copywriter or online marketing expert and you don't need to be one. If you take this course, you can outsource and cooperate with copywriters because you know what to expect from them and what makes good sales content.</p><p>I want you to experience that feeling when you know your sales content is crushing it and converts, and you confidently know it. It gives you control and this calm inner piece.</p><p>You want to help your best clients make the best buying decision – if the product is the perfect fit.</p><p>And let me make this clear. Those who say “you can sell anything” – it's simply BS. Maybe you can cheat few sales together. But if you think for long-term, you think of your authenticity as one of your primary assets. Therefore, you want to sell outstanding products, and that's not enough. You want to sell for those whom you can transform. Your product has to be a real solution for real problems of real people. And it has to make a real difference.</p><p>The methods I reveal in this course are not able to sell crap. But if you have an excellent product, these critical components are going to help you to sell the crap out of a great product.</p><p>Great sales content help your prospects to identify if this product is really a right fit for them. And that's a biggie because you don't want to be pushy or sleazy, you want to keep your authentic voice – and sell more at the same time.</p><p>In a couple of minutes, you'll be ready for all the sales content you need for your sales page. If you fill in this 1 PDF, you already have a high-converting sales page in your hand.</p><p>You'll get the Salespage Checklist, which is a 1-page PDF. It's the shortest tool to evaluate your existing sales content if it has all the necessary components. This alone can save your hours of figuring out what's missing. You can just simply scan through your sales page and instantly know if something is missing and how to fix it.</p><p>I offer 2 bonuses for my first 100 buyers.</p><p>I give you email feedback on your sales letter or sales video for free. As soon as your sales page is ready, just shoot me an email and I'll make specific recommendations on how to improve your conversions.</p><p>If you make only 1 tiny change on your sales page in might have an enormous impact on your revenue for the lifetime of your product.  I've spent more than 2 years with studying copywriting and now compressed it into the most effective action plan possible. You can save this 2 years with this short course.</p><p>The highest value activity you can do in the following 25 minutes of your life is to improve your sales page.</p><p>It'll generate more sales automatically for long-term. You invest this time once, and you get the benefits for the lifetime of your product.</p><p>If you make only 1 more sales from your existing book or products it already worth the investment.</p><p>If you're unsatisfied for whatever reason, you get 100% of your money back, Udemy also defends you. If you don't make at least 1 more sales with my tested methods, just shot me an email and I refund your money. </p><p>I understand if you want to procrastinate. But I don't want you to focus on things that are not essentials and lose not just those clients you might have, but also the fulfilment and joy what you get by having control in your business.</p><p>Click the link below this video and start this course now. Let me help you sell more from what you already have and get focus on what really matters.</p><p>See you inside!</p>",
