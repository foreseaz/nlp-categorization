    "description": "<p>This course is about stimulating your creativity and imagination in service of the non-profit with which you are associated.  </p><p>Board members are charged with fundraising.  Often, they get stuck.  The old ways of fundraising aren't working any longer.  They don't know what else to do.  </p><p>First things first are contained in the first part.  Your organization's foundation must be well-structured and sound before thinking fundraising.</p><p>The second part gives you loads of ideas - some old - some new.  Whatever idea you have make sure it fits your group.  You can combine some of these ideas to make your fundraiser even more spectacular.  </p><p>The third part contains some ideas which may stretch your ideas about fundraising or you may say - \"It's so obvious.  Why didn't we think of it?\"</p><p>There are a million and one fundraising ideas out there - this course is simply a stimulus for your group to put your brainstorming caps on and decide upon something.  You can watch it over and over and over again - use it annually - and share your successes.  I can add them to the course and help other groups.   </p>",
