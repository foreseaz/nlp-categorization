Imagine what that could do to your online reputation and your ability to get paying customers through your doors!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  What Else Could Tarnish Your Hotel’s Reputation?  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  It would surprise me if you were able to tell me without a doubt, right now, what people were saying about your hotel online. Sure, you may know your ranking on some of the top review sites, but do you know where the negative comments are?  </p>  <p>  \t  And more importantly, do you know how to push them out of the curious eyes of potential guests at your hotel? Probably not.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><em>  According to a study conducted in 2012 by Google and an independent marketing research company, Ipsos MediaCT, 96% of leisure travellers start their planning with a search online.  </em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Regardless of how spotless your reputation is offline, a traveller is still highly likely to see what people say about your hotel online before they even consider to book their stay.  </p>  <p>  \t  Not monitoring your online reputation is no longer an option. Smart hotel owners know that they need to manage their reputation to fill their rooms.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  “There Are So Many Pages to Monitor, I Couldn’t Possibly Do It!”  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  You’re right. We’ve heard the same worries from numerous hotel owners when they learned how critical monitoring their online reputation is too. The truth is, search results are constantly changing, and it feels impossible to keep up with everything being talked about your property online.  </p>  <p>  \t  It feels impossible to monitor your search results every day, AND react to bad reviews.  </p>  <p>  \t  That’s why so many hotel owners just give up. Smart hotel owners know people are writing reviews about their hotel online now and then, but many just don’t have the time or energy to keep up with it all. These hotel owners believe that…  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  “Negative Reviews Will Go Away On Their Own As Soon As They <span>Get More Positive Feedback”</span></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Too many hotel owners put the importance of their online reputation to the wayside. They think if they stay focused on asking happy guests for positive reviews, everything will work itself out. They don’t realize that they need to spend time trying to make those negative reviews go away.  </p>  <p>  \t  While positive reviews may push down negative reviews in some cases, the constant upgrades from Google search engine algorithm have stopped this from happening as easily as it once used to. Now, as more people turn to search engines like Google to find more information about their hotel before booking a trip, negative reviews seem to have a far greater impact on the overall success of a hotel.  </p>  <p>  \t  Something that’s surprising for many hotel owners is how many people use more than one device to book their stay. <em><strong>Google found that 90% of users move sequentially from one screen or device to the other when accomplishing tasks like booking travel.</strong></em> This increases the chance of people seeing those negative reviews while they search for your hotel!  </p>  <p>  \t  And as you know, this puts your hotel at a greater risk of losing customers because of just one bad review!  </p>  <p>  \t  “But Anyone Can Say Anything Online These Days!”  </p>  <p>  \t  That’s certainly true!  </p>  <p>  \t  With your hotel’s reputation in the hands of just about anyone (even people that may never have stayed in your hotel) it can seem impossible to manage customer impulses, and digital reviews. It may feel like you’re trying to wrangle in herds of people who you have no control over.  </p>  <p>  \t  Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be that hard – or time consuming. There’s a better way to avoid getting bad reviews online, and an easier way to make positive reviews stand out more. By knowing what is being said about your hotel online, and how to respond to a bad review, your online reputation management becomes a lot more effective. <em><strong>In turn, you increase your REVPAR, while also helping your hotel to rank higher in the search engine results.</strong></em>  </p>  <p>  \t  When you have a clear breakdown of the steps that you must take to ensure your online reputation remains intact, managing your online reputation becomes easy and efficient.  </p>  <p>  \t  You’ll get those exact steps broken down in an easy to follow format when you sign up for my training TODAY!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  Introducing Online Reputation Management For Independent Hotels!  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Where you’ll learn...  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  How to Turn Your Online Reputation Into One Big Raving Review.  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This isn’t your run of the mill online reputation management training.
