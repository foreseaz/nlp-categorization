    "description": "<p>This is a course in corporate governance, but don't let that scare you.  If you are in business today, ask yourself whether your company is benefiting directly from having a Board of Directors.   The truth is, few do and most management teams see their Board as just another group of bosses that meddle in the affairs of the business.</p><p>It doesn't and it should have to be this way.  The Board of Directors can add significant value to help the organization attain its vision and fulfill its mission.  This course will look at three key Board Leadership Roles that are rarely taught in undergraduate or even masters level business programs.    Whether your company is public, private, non-profit, or even a government agency, the principles discussed will apply to your organization.</p>",
