And one of the most important things that you need to do is to perform market research and to find out whether or not there is a market for the product you’re trying to sell.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Furthermore, if you have a product that has a market, where is that market located? Is it in another country or your very own?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Do you know where your potential buyers like to hang out? Do you know what sites they’re on? Do you know how to reach them?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       And the questions don’t stop here! You need to have answers to even more questions if you want to make sure that you’ll know who to market to:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t       -What’s the competition in your market?  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t       -Who is your competition?  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t       -What is your completion doing?  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t       -What are you doing that your competition isn’t?  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t       -And more…  \t</p>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t       There are tons of questions that you need to have answers to before you determine whether or not the market you want to get into is really profitable and for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       So, what’s the conclusion? Market research is of the utmost importance!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       At the same time, trying to get to the bottom of things, knowing what your buyers respond to, knowing what they like and don’t like is equally important.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       No matter if you have a product idea that you think is a money maker or you already have a finished product, knowing the answers to the above questions is going to help you tremendously in achieving your goals which translates into making money!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       This is why this video course was created: so that you have a clear understanding of how you should look at your market and how to know what your buyers want from you (the most important thing in any sales process). It’s a whole lot easier creating a product based on a belief than it is to create a product customized for your buyers’ needs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       If you want to find the answers to all of the above questions and to make sure that you did everything in your power to make your product sell then THIS is for YOU!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Introducing...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Market Research Classroom</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Here’s the list of videos that you’ll get in this course:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 1 – Overview</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 2 – Niche Research Tools</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 3 - Using Free Tools Part 1</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 4 – Using Free Tools 2</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 5 -  Find Customers Trend in a Niche</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 6 - Researching Affiliate Products</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 7 – Finnding Trending Topics</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 8 - Research from Questions and Answers Sites</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 9 - Advanced Research</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Video# 10 – Hijacking Your Competitor&#039;s Niche   </strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  Video #11 - Finding Trends on Social Media  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  video #12 - Conclusion  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Get this 12 part video course and know that you’ll not only find the right niche, but also that you’ll know exactly what your customers want! </strong>  </p>",
