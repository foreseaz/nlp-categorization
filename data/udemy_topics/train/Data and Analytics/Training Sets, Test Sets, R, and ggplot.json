    "description": "<p style=\"\">In this course, I show you how to evaluate the performance of a regression model using training sets and test sets.  We will use R and ggplot as our tools.  Along the way, we will learn how to row-slice data frames, use the predict function in R, and add titles and labels to our plots.  We will also work on our programming skills by learning how to write for loops and functions of two variables.</p><p style=\"\">Students should have the background in R, ggplot, and regression equivalent to what one would have after viewing my two Udemy courses on linear and polynomial regression.  At a relaxed pace, it should take about two weeks to complete the course.</p>",
