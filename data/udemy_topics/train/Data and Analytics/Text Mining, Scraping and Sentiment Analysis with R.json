We will use Twitter data as our example dataset.  </p>  <p>  \t  During this course we will take a walk through the whole text analysis process of Twitter data.  </p>  <p>  \t  At first you will learn which packages are available for social media analysis.  </p>  <p>  \t  You will learn how to scrape social media (Twitter) data and get it into your R session.  </p>  <p>  \t  After that we will filter, clean and structure our text corpus.  </p>  <p>  \t  The next step is the visualization of the text data via wordclouds and dendrograms.  </p>  <p>  \t  And in the last section we will do a whole sentiment analysis by using a common word lexicon.  </p>  <p>  \t  All of those steps are accompanied by exercise sessions so that you can check if you can put the information to work.  </p>  <p>  \t  According to the teaching principles of R Tutorials every section is enforced with <strong style=\"\">exercises</strong> for a better learning experience. You can download the <strong style=\"\">code pdf</strong> of every section to try the presented code on your own.  </p>  <p>  \t  If you are not yet on an advanced level in R programming, we would highly recommend our R Level 1 course. The <strong style=\"\">Level 1 course</strong> covers all the basic coding strategies that are essential for your day to day programming. R features like functions and apply are covered in the Level 1 course and are also needed for this course.  </p>  <p>  \t  For special offers and combinations just check out the <strong style=\"\">r-tutorials webpage</strong> which you can find below the instructor profile.  </p>  <p>  \t  What R you waiting for?  </p>  <p>  \t  Martin  </p>",
