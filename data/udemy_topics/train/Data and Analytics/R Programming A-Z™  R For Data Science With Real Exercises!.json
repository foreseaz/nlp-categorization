    "description": "<p>Learn R Programming by doing!</p><p>There are lots of R courses and lectures out there. However, R has a very steep learning curve and students often get overwhelmed. This course is different!</p><p>This course is truly step-by-step. In every new tutorial we build on what had already learned and move one extra step forward.</p><p>After every video you learn a new valuable concept that you can apply right away. And the best part is that you learn through live examples.</p><p>This training is packed with real-life analytical challenges which you will learn to solve. Some of these we will solve together, some you will have as homework exercises.</p><p>In summary, this course has been designed for all skill levels and even if you have no programming or statistical background you will be successful in this course!</p><p>I can't wait to see you in class,</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Kirill Eremenko</p>",
