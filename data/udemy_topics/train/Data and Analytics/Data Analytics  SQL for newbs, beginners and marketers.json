    "description": "<p>It is becoming ever more important that companies make <strong>data-driven decisions</strong>.</p><p>With <strong>big data</strong> and <strong>data science</strong> on the rise, we have more data than we know what to do with.</p><p>One of the basic languages of <strong>data analytics</strong> is SQL, which is used for many popular databases including <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong>, <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong>, <strong>Oracle</strong>, and even big data solutions like <strong>Hive</strong> and <strong>Cassandra</strong>.</p><p>Iâ€™m going to let you in on a little secret. Most high-level marketers and product managers at big tech companies know how to manipulate data to gain important insights. No longer do you have to wait around the entire day for some software engineer to answer your questions - now you can find the answers directly, by yourself, using SQL!</p><p>In this course, <strong>SQL for marketers</strong>, we'll start from the basics - installing SQL onto your <strong>Mac, Linux, or Windows</strong> machine and explaining what a relational database is. Next, we'll look at basic tasks like creating tables and loading data into those tables. We will look at a wide variety of SQL commands and I will show you how to <strong>speed things up using indexes</strong>.</p><p>Once you know all the SQL commands we will start doing advanced examples - answering questions marketers and business people often have, like where are customers dropping off in our <strong>sales funnel</strong>? And which of our locations has the <strong>highest revenue</strong>?</p><p>In the last section, we'll do <strong>Advanced SQL queries on Spark</strong>, the <strong>big data</strong> framework that is the successor to <strong>MapReduce</strong> and also runs on top of <strong>Hadoop</strong>. I will teach you how to install Spark, create a cluster very quickly on <strong>Amazon EC2</strong>, and run SQL queries, allowing you to apply everything you learned up until this point in a big data environment.</p><p><span></span>Do you want to know how to optimize your sales funnel using SQL, look at the seasonal trends in your industry, and run a SQL query on Hadoop? Then join me now in my new class, SQL for marketers! Dominate data analytics, data science, and big data!</p>",
