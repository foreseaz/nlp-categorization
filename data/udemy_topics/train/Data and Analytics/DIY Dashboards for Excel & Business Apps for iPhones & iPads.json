It works natively (i.e. online <strong><em>or off-line</em></strong>) on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>The program you download from the resource section will automatically convert a simple spreadsheet into a sophisticated Business App that works with FileMaker Go. Therefore you will be able to distribute your own apps to as many people and iOS devices as you like.</p><p>More advanced users can even host an online version which will work with most browsers including Android.  The advanced version can also integrate with everything from SQL to SAP.  However the this advanced (multi-user) version called \"OneBusinessApp - Professional\" is beyond the scope of this training course.  More advanced users may still want to take this course to refine core skills required in more advanced implementations.</p><p>However, this training course is squarely aimed at the typical Excel user who wants a simple method for building their own Dashboards and Business Apps.</p><p>Sign up today to start creating your own Dashboards and iPhone apps without learning a single line of code.</p>",
