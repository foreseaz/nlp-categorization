    "description": "<p>This course will get you started in building your FIRST <strong>artificial neural network</strong> using <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">deep learning</strong> techniques. Following my previous course on logistic regression, we take this basic building block, and build full-on non-linear neural networks right out of the gate using Python and Numpy. All the materials for this course are FREE.</p>\n\n<p>We extend the previous binary classification model to multiple classes using the softmax function, and we derive the very important training method called \"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">backpropagation</strong>\" using first principles. I show you how to code backpropagation in Numpy, first \"the slow way\", and then \"the fast way\" using Numpy features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we implement a neural network using Google's new TensorFlow library.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You should take this course if you are interested in starting your journey toward becoming a master at deep learning, or if you are interested in <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">machine learning</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">data science</strong> in general. We go beyond basic models like logistic regression and linear regression and I show you something that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">automatically learns features</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course provides you with many practical examples so that you can really see how deep learning can be used on anything. Throughout the course, we'll do a course project, which will show you how to predict user actions on a website given user data like whether or not that user is on a mobile device, the number of products they viewed, how long they stayed on your site, whether or not they are a returning visitor, and what time of day they visited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another project at the end of the course shows you how you can use deep learning for facial expression recognition. Imagine being able to predict someone's emotions just based on a picture!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After getting your feet wet with the fundamentals, I provide a brief overview of some of the newest developments in neural networks - slightly modified architectures and what they are used for.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE:<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you <em>already</em> know about softmax and backpropagation, and you want to skip over the theory and speed things up using more advanced techniques along with GPU-optimization, check out my follow-up course on this topic, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Data Science: Practical Deep Learning Concepts in Theano and TensorFlow</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I have other courses that cover more advanced topics, such as <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Restricted Boltzmann Machines</strong>, <strong>Autoencoders</strong>, and more! But you want to be very comfortable with the material in this course before moving on to more advanced subjects.</p>\n\n<p>All the code for this course can be downloaded from my github: /lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples</p>\n\n<p>In the directory: ann_class</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you always \"git pull\" so you have the latest version!</p><p>HARD PREREQUISITES / KNOWLEDGE YOU ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE:</p><ul><li>calculus</li><li>linear algebra</li><li>probability</li><li>Python coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets</li><li>Numpy coding: matrix and vector operations, loading a CSV file</li></ul>",
