    "description": "<p>You are interested in learning about Data and Tableau Data Analytics and getting into the wide realm of Data Science. You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of getting your feet wet in Tableau and Data Science (even if you are not interested in this, you should seriously consider so since in the next 10-15 years, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence will be everywhere).</p><p>I have learned over 14 programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++, R, Matlab, Ruby, CSS, HTML, Angular JS, Java Script as well as other . I have also had a successful freelancing career programming software and mobile applications and well as working as a finance data analyst. Since technology is changing every day, it is adding new realms of complexity to data science than is already out there. It is getting exponentially harder for new people to learn and navigate the immense amount of data science aspects. My job in this course is to demyistify Tableau and Data Analysis so you can see a clear road to success as a Tableau Data analyst. <br></p><p>This course serves to help you navigate Tableau and know what this seemingly difficult concept really is. In this course, I cover what it is like to be a data analyst, what are some jobs of data analysts, what are the sorts of super powers you can possess by learning Tableau Data, and also what resources you will need on your path to development as a Tableau Data Analyst. My hope is to transform you in 4-5 lectures from being a novice to data and what is possible with Tableau to being someone who has a clear idea of whether he/she is interested in Tableau and what path they can take to further their knowledge and harness the POWER of Tableau.<br></p><p>There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Tableau I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how you can start learning how to dominate data analytics and how you can supercharge your business, marketing, or client with your superb analytics skills.</p>",
