    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      We live in a world of problems. Be it in office, your own business or home, we are expected to solve them all the time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Conventional analytical skill that you have acquired, is hardly helpful. Many times you don’t even have a structured approach to solve problems. Be it mites at home or failing profits in a corporate, we generously use trial and error method. In doing so, we consume disproportionate energy, time and resources.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Have you ever wondered, why?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Even most simple problems, such as forgetting to refill your grocery stock, have multiple underlying reasons that are interlinked to each other. As a result, using simple analytical tools such as charts, graphs, tables, etc, we will never be able to solve these problems.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Whereas our brain has enormous capability to easily understand non-linear &amp; multidimensional relationships and solve complex problems if we are willing to ‘visualize’!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Visualization is not a pure art form. So you don’t need to be an artist, or be gifted. And neither do you need to glaze at a whiteboard in a silent room to visualize. There are proven tools with clear procedures that can be learnt and used to effectively solve problems visually.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This course covers simple non-math visual business analysis tools that can be applied in any business situation to visually analyze and solve problems of varying complexity.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  3 cool tools for visual business analysis tools</strong> that you will learn in this course are:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Cause and effect Diagram</strong> to analyze a problem from various dimensions &amp; collect all possible reasons for the problem</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Affinity Diagram</strong> is group and sort large amount of information gathered through surveys, interviews to arrive at meaningful inferences</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Deployment Flow Charts </strong>(Swim Lanes or Process Maps) to understand and analyze the flow of activities involving multiple cross-functional stakeholders so that ownership and accountability issues can be addressed, etc</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Whether you are a business analyst or any other professional, you don’t need to force yourself to document the views of others or be trapped in known/acceptable outcomes from the analysis of any problem. You can now challenge the status quo and think beyond the obvious. You will be able to handle business analysis, comfortably.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Visual business analysis and visual modeling is evolving as a critical skill. Soon knowing these tools will be mandatory for every professional, not just business analyst.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">How is this course different from others?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I have built this course based on my learning of over 18 years, applying them across industries. Introduction to every tool starts with a live business scenario. So you will be able to easily relate to the tool and instantly apply to a real problem.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Further the solution to the live business scenarios have also be included for download.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  For each tool, clear step-by-step procedure, benefits and tips have been included thereby removing ambiguity.  </p>",
