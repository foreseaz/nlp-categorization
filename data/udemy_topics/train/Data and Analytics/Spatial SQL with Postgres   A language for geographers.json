    "description": "<p>Are you stuck in a rut of only knowing how to use a GIS GUI?  Do you want to learn how to automate tasks, but are afraid of computer programming.  If so, SQL is the most powerful tool you can learn to help you perform complex GIS tasks.  This course is designed to teach you how to write SQL to replicate many database and GIS tasks.  We will start at a very basic overview, and then proceed to more advanced topics related to GIS. </p><p>Through a series of lectures, I will work side-by-side with you to develop SQL queries that perform advanced GIS tasks, some of which might be impossible to perform in the GUI.  Once my students learn GIS, they very rarely want to return back to using the GUI. </p><p>By writing SQL code alongside me, you will see how solving GIS tasks in SQL is like a second nature.  This is a very comprehensive course that should take multiple days to complete - but don't worry about that - you will be having a lot of fun learning how powerful SQL can be, and continually ask yourself \"why didn't I start using SQL sooner!\"</p>",
