Thankfully we have the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Qlik </strong>suite of products to help us with this and my all time favorite is QlikSense, I liked it so much, I took a leave of absence and spent 3 months developing this course for all those that want a hands on approach to learning and a certificate that showcases your technical achievement as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">QlikSense</strong> is the next generation of <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">QlikView</strong>.</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>QlikSense is overtaking so many of it's peers mostly because of it's underlying '<em>associative data model</em>' technology and absolute ease of discovery for insightful decision making and story telling, and I'm certain after doing this course you will not want to revert to the old clunky ways of surfacing your analytics like you did with those products from the older monolithic vendors that will always impose their ways to your work flow and creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course of study is designed to transition your skills into a deep understanding of QlikSense app development.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I am always available to help you and answer your questions, even when you have completed the course.</p>\n\n<p>Regards </p>\n\n<p>Paul</p>",
