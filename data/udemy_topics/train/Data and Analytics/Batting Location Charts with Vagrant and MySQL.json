    "description": "<p>This course is about working with large sets of PITCHf/x data to create batting location charts.  We use R to scrape and visualize the data and MySQL to store the data.  The course includes lessons on how to install a virtual Ubuntu machine, how to install MySQL, how to perform basic MySQL administrative tasks, and how to connect R and MySQL.  </p><p>It would be best if you have some knowledge of R and ggplot.  This can be obtained through my previous three courses in baseball analytics.  However, it might be possible to follow along without this.</p><p>At a relaxed pace, the course should take about two weeks to complete.</p>",
