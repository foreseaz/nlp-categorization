We will focus on developing and validating a logistic regression model in this class.  </p>  <p>  \tWe will walk you through our 6-step modeling process step-by-step.  Together, we will solve a real-world modeling project with real-world data. We will provide extensive demo on SAS code development, running SAS codes, and explaining SAS outputs. We will also provide you all the SAS codes used in this course.  </p>  <p>  \tAt the end of the class, you should be able to develop a logistic regression model independently.  </p>",
