Together, we will solve a real-world modeling project using SAS software. I will provide extensive demo on SAS coding, running codes, and explaining outputs for each step. All SAS codes and modeling data will be made available to you as well.  </p>  <p>  \t     The goal for this training is for you to be able to develop a professional-level linear regression model independently.  </p>",
