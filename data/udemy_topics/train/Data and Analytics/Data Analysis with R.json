Main statistical capabilities behind data science covered.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                               Course is <strong style=\"\">interactive</strong>. Specific topic covered in each lecture. Each lecture includes multiple examples. All material covered in videos are available for download! This way student is able to program himself - break things and fix them.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                               Students will finish course in approximately 7-10 days working 3 hours per day.

Biggest emphasis put on real examples and programming yourself. This distinguishes this course from other material available online - usual courses includes vague slides and long textbooks with no real practise.  </p>",
