We often don't appreciate the nitty-gritty, and are left with vaguely uncomfortable each time we try to change our query - and clueless when our queries don't run, or when they return unexpected results.<br></p><p><strong>Joins</strong> are probably the most useful type of queries out there. They are the glue that bind together tables in a database, that connect the dots.<br></p><p>Once we <strong>understand - really understand - joins</strong>, even very complex queries start to make sense. And that's why this course is all about <strong>joins</strong>, with examples in MySQL to drive home the theory.</p><ul><li>Inner joins</li><li>Outer joins</li><li>Cross joins</li><li>Natural joins</li><li>Left and right joins</li><li>Wrap up all of this with examples in MySQL!</li></ul><p>Mail us about anything - <strong>anything!</strong> - and we will always reply :-)<br></p>",
