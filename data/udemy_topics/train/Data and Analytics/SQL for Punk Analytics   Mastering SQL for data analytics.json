I really liked the way you have explained the things like query from business and how we can answer it using SQL.. this kind of approach I never seen in any of course in udemy .. hope you going to add more and more such a realistic scenarios which could help us visualising real time business scenarios while learning the code… Thanks a lot </em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">SQL</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">S</strong>tructured <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Q</strong>uery<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> L</strong>anguage, when interacting with a relational database e.g. OLTP ,data warehouse, data mart etc, then we will always use SQL as the primary query language, this is how we connect and analyse the data before going further with other tools such as  'R' , SAS, Qlik etc to do the heavy lifting such as forecasting or data visualizations etc.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I will teach you SQL from the ground up, and the SQL that other courses don't teach , after all , if you know more, you can do more! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how to construct smarter SQL to bring the punk rebel out in you, making those discoveries that provide insight to influence business decisions.
