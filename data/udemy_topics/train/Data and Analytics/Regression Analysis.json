    "description": "<p>This course covers running and evaluating linear regression models (simple regression, multiple regression, and hierarchical regression), including assessing the overall quality of models and interpreting individual predictors for significance. We also explore R-Square in depth, including how to interpret R-Square for significance. Together with in-depth coverage of simple, multiple and hierarchical regression, we&#039;ll also explore correlation, which is closely related to regression analysis. By the end of this course you will be skilled in running and interpreting your own linear regression analyses, as well as critically evaluating the work of others. Examples of running regression in both SPSS and Excel provided. Lectures provided in HD video with course quizzes also provided.  Taught by a PhD award-winning university instructor with over 15 years of teaching experience. While you can be confident that you are getting accurate information with Quantitative Specialists, we also make it our highest priority in creating crystal-clear, easy-to-follow videos.
