    "description": "<p>  \t        A study done by IAG, has shown that only about half of major projects with <strong style=\"\">average</strong> level business analysts succeed (56% to be exact). That number increases to 88% when <strong style=\"\">skilled</strong> or <strong style=\"\">above average</strong> business analysts are involved. Being average is not enough to get the job done anymore.  </p>  <p>  \t     This course gives techniques and practice drills to help gain the most essential skills to quickly be an above average business analyst. Our goal isn&#039;t to develop every skill a business analyst should have; instead, I am to give you the most productive skills and the ability to use them in days instead of decades.  </p>  <p>  \t         The purpose of this course is NOT to explain or  walk you through all the different parts of what being a business analyst is. The purpose of this course is to give you skills that you can learn and use today that will make you a better business analyst tomorrow.  </p>  <p>  \t     Note: When I say tomorrow, I do not mean next month or next year. I mean the day after today.  </p>",
