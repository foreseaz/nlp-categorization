    "description": "<p style=\"\">In this course, we make use of PITCHf/x data to create pitch location charts for a given baseball game.  We break the game out into each at-bat and visualize the location, type, and speed of each pitch, the order in which the pitches were thrown, and the outcome of the at-bat.</p><p style=\"\">In order to accomplish this, we will be taking a deep dive into ggplot.  We will learn much about how to work with color, how to use aesthetics, and how to facet.  We will also gain additional R skills, such as how to subset a vector and how to work with factors.  </p><p style=\"\">One should be able to complete the course, at a relaxed pace, in about three weeks.  It is best if students already have a little bit of a background in R, dplyr, and ggplot, but it is not completely necessary.</p>",
