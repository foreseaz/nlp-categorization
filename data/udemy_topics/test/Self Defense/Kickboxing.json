    "description": "<p>Learning kickboxing has never been this easy and systematic.</p><p>We know that you're looking for a <em>high quality kickboxing</em> course and high quality in kickboxing means <em><strong>health</strong></em>, <em><strong>strength</strong></em><strong></strong> and <em><strong>esthetic</strong></em> for us. So we started to produce a series of courses. </p><p><strong>What you'll learn about kickboxing</strong><br>Warmup and stretching,<br>Keeping guard,<br>Jab,<br>Cross,<br>Hook,<br>Uppercut,<br>Front kick,<br>Low kick,<br>Roundhouse kick,<br>Axe kick,<br>Spinning kick</p><p><strong>Who</strong><br>This course can be seen as for new beginners but it's for all levels. You'll learn how to warm up your body, how to stretch your muscles efficiently and using techniques in a right way.</p><p><strong>Why and how</strong><br>You will have lessons about warming up and stretching your body to prevent injuries. You cannot hit a sandbag while your muscles are not ready. First they should be ready to learn new things. After they are ready you'll teach them right, basic techniques. At the last, hitting a target will come.</p><p><strong>When</strong><br>Recommended time to finish this course is about 1 month. Of course for some people it can be longer or shorter. Every person's physical capacity is not same and this will make difference.</p><p>Also eating and sleeping is very important for a healthy sports life. It's recommended to stop eating 3 hours before kickboxing training.</p><p>For first 5 trainings you shouldn't pass 1 hour of training time. After 5 trainings increase time step by step through your physical capacity.</p><p>For the workouts, first, you should make a great warm up and stretching. While performing techniques always use both left and right side guards. Technical quality on both sides should go together. Average repeats for each technique should be about 50. If it's too much for your level decrease or vice versa increase if it's too easy.<br>Between techniques take rest about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p><p>For beginning level making 2 or 3 workouts per week is enough.<br>We know that Hollywood style spinning kick has a great visuality but specially for the first weeks repeating basic elements a lot is important to improve a good technique.</p><p>After first month your muscles and joints will be almost ready to hit a sandbag and we'll continue with next course.</p>",
