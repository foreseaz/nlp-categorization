    "description": "<p>  \t Everyone knows that self defence knowledge is a good thing to have, however traditional self defence training is well...not everyones cup of tea!  </p>  <p>  \t As a martial arts instructor I know not everyone wants to spend months and years &quot;playing&quot; Kung Fu or trying to become badass at the local martial arts school.  </p>  <p>  \t The other big issue is life and time is ever more scarce in today&#039;s fast paced society! Therefore if you&#039;re a busy individual or you just don&#039;t like fighting (which would make sense if you are looking for self defence help!) then this course might just be for you!  </p>  <p>  \t You don&#039;t have to be the next Bruce Lee or Mike tyson to stay safe. Its not about how tough you can make yourself. It really is about learning the common sense rules presented in this course.  </p>  <p>  \t In the course you will learn the essentials to the most important things about self defence PREVENTION! You will learn about non physical self defence, staying safe and avoiding dangerous situations.  </p>  <p>  \t Please note there are no physical &quot;moves&quot; or &quot;techniques&quot; its all about using your brain and not your brawn as your primary self defence tool. Something that does not get covered in most rough tough martial arts classes! However in everyday life we cant go around lashing out on every potential threat we see!  </p>  <p>  \t In This unique course I will also share with you some of the secrets your martial arts instructor doesn&#039;t want you to know!  </p>  <p>  \t The course is presented to you by martial arts instructor scott paterson. Scott Is The Creator of 30 minute self defence System and The Old ENglish Self Defence Company. Scott has also produced several Martial Arts and Self Defence TV Shows broadcast in the UK and Europe.  </p>  <p>  \t So what are you waiting for? lets get started!  </p>",
