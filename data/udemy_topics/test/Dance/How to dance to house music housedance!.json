This is a big problem in teaching and in learning. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Because if someone doesn't understand something, they will miss the rest of the information of the class because their attention is on what they are stuck in..

She is a brilliant dancer and teacher and I love how she sees every student as an individual and helps each one to set and achieve personal goals by challenging onesellf and always bringing one out of the comfortzone. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>The best part is that in her classes it doesn’t matter if you’re an achieving proffessional dancer or just enjoy the workout - the dancestudio is always full of sweat and joy no matter of the different levels of the students in class, and it’s easy to feel comfortable already as a beginner. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>After a year of working as Maggies assistant and growing as a dancer by her side I was confident enough to apply to Broadway Dance Center where my intention was to continue my focus on house and waacking but I missed Maggies way of focusing on freestyle and searched outside of BDC. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Through Maggie I got to know about and meet some great housedance personalitys like Bravo and Conrad that I had the chance to practice with during my six months in New York.

I was doing my last year at Danscenter Stockholm and she worked with my class for three weeks straight. She was such an inspiring and talented teacher.  After I graduated DC Stockholm I went to New York City to dance at the Broadway Dance Center. There I danced for many great teachers, but not many of them had the versatility Maggie has in dance.  Coming back to Sweden after 2 years I had the privilege of joining a House group led by Maggie once a week. Her musicality, passion and skill outshine most dancers I’ve worked with / Hannah.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"My name is Linnéa Sonka and i started dance when i was 16. 3 years ago i Discoved the dancestyle house, in Paris. There i practice the tecnique of the Style, 1 year later i started to take classes for Maggie aulin in stockholm. This really opened up My eyes to Where house is really from and the love the Style containes. What i like ALOT with Maggies classes is That i was introduced to new teaching methodes. To focus on the individual dancer, Style and how each person can grow and reach him/her goals. Her classes is Always like a creative fActory - thanks to diffrent tasks during freestyle practice! Maggie stands for passion, knowledge and the you of dance!! I think i have developed Alot during her classes.\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
