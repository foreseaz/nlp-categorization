    "description": "<p>Traditionally, to learn how to break, you could <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">spend anywhere from $200-$1,200 in studio and private lessons </strong>just to get the basics. The problem is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">most studio instructors are unqualified</strong>; they learn a few moves on Youtube, watch some dance movies and decide to start teaching. You end up with a watered down experience that’s a waste of time and money. To really get the basics, <strong>y</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">ou need the right trainer.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Huy and I’ve spent the last 20 years traveling the globe learning from pioneers and innovators in the dance. I’ve used the knowledge to train my crew, win numerous battles and develop a teaching method that works. Thanks to Udemy, my <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Breakdancing Basics </strong></em>course is now available online. Now it's more convenient to learn and much more affordable. Sign up today. It's your time to own the dance floor!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How The A.B.A. Method Works</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A.B.A stands for <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">awareness, breakdown, and application</strong>. I developed this method to teach difficult moves to my crew but realized it works equally well for <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">beginners</strong>. It's <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">like learning a new language</strong>: moves are the vocabulary and combos are like sentences. You start by learning to pronounce words (body awareness). Then, you learn simple conjugation (breakdown). Finally, you use what you've learned in simple sentences (application to music) and repeat in intervals till you have it committed to muscle memory. The course <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">includes</strong> both basic and intermediate moves, warm-ups, cool-downs, conditioning exercises, contexts for application (your Bar Mitzvah or office party is just the tip of the iceberg), history, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">practice mixes</strong>, list of videos to study and an invitation to a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">private community forum</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> to share progress, get mentorship and find local events to attend</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why I’m Doing This Project</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This dance gave me direction in my early teens, introduced me to my wife in my 20s and now, in my 30s, still brings me joy in a way that’s hard to put into words. My intention is to share that happiness with you. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n\t           </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>",
