I have been doing this at a university now for almost five years and I am excited about bringing it to Udemy now as well.</p><p>Nearly every country in the world is affected by U.S. policies. If you look closely enough, you can surely find some aspect of the government where you are that is based on the U.S. system. Are your politicians talking about adopting a US-style medical care, jury trial, or lobbying system and you are not sure if that is a good or bad idea?  This class will help you to figure it out for yourself.</p><p><em>Course Format</em></p><p>This course is taught in screen-cast format. I give overviews of each topic and relevant case studies where appropriate. Links are provided to resources used in the lecture sessions, so you may check it out for yourself (and possibly in your native language if you need to). There is also a short quiz for each section.</p><p><em>Topics Covered</em><span><br></span></p><ol><li>North America before the United States</li><li>The Constitution</li><li>Civil Liberties</li><li>Civil Rights</li><li>Media and Public Opinion</li><li>Political Parties and Interest Groups</li><li>Campaigns and Elections</li><li>Congress</li><li>The Presidency</li><li>The Judiciary</li></ol>",
