When it comes to Medicare many people are so confused that they don't even know what question to ask or who they should believe. </p>\n\n<p>Most of us have never had to worry about choosing the right health plan on our own before. That's because an employer did it for us. But, when it comes to Medicare, figuring out which plan is best or even who to believe can seem like a game of chance. In this course you will learn Medicare basics and how to avoid some costly pitfalls that many people are not aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to take the confusion out of the process by offering objective, personalized guidance in selecting the Medicare plan that's right for you. </p>",
