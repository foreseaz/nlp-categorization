    "description": "<p>A lot of the advice around says write the introduction for an assignment last. This is terrible advice - we know tit is bad because we are teachers and academics that have written and read hundred/thousands of assignments. The introduction is where your mark is primarily determined in the marker's mind. If we don't see the answer to the question there, it is usually a bad sign for the rest of the assignment. A good answer right up front in the introduction gets us interested in reading your assignment in more depth.</p><p>Drawing on the experience of PhD students, Lecturers, Tutors, and Senior Academics we have pulled together the best advice for getting that introduction perfect. </p><p>If your set it up right, then the rest of the assignment should just fall into place! So take a look at the advice here and maximize your grades!</p>",
