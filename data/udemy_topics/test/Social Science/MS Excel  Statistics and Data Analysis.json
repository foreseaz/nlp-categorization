    "description": "<p>Present day organizations are data driven. Starting from Start-ups to Conglomerates every organization is relying on data for decision making. Organizations are flooded with data from multiple facets (websites, social network sites, third party data sources, daily operational data etc). Skimming this data to get meaningful information has become daunting task for organizations. They are looking for skilled manpower who can convert this gigantic data into sleek information for decision making. This course is for the beginners who wish to test the water in Data Analytics. </p><p>This course fuses Statistical Analysis with MS Excel because of which you would be able to churn legions of data into meaningful information within no time. Excel has hundreds of built-in functions and Data Analysis Toolpak (Excel Add-in) with which you can run descriptive statistics to predictive analysis with ease. In this course I created videos that help you understand statistical concepts and solve complex equations using Excel. Excel Workbooks are provided to you for practice and master the concepts.</p><p><br></p>",
