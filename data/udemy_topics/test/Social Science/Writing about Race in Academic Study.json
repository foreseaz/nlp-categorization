    "description": "<p>This course was mainly designed for undergraduate students on arts / social sciences / humanities degrees who will write about race / racial identity in their academic studies. In our experience, many students from \"BME\" backgrounds have great ideas, but struggle to express these in academic writing at university. This course was designed primarily to address their needs, but it can be beneficial to <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">any </em>university student who needs some support on this often overlooked and rarely discussed topic. </p>\n\n<p>This course is not about \"race\" <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">per se</em> - rather, it aims to give students the tips and confidence needed to write about related topics well. You should expect the course to guide you through the process of completing a written academic assignment and you should be somewhat familiar with items mentioned in the course such as your module handbook (issued by your university department).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is about academic success, but it has a personal development approach - as we believe all students can achieve their goals by adopting the right strategies and taking the necessary action.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You should take this course if you are studying any degree programme where you may need to write assignments related to race / racial identity, from Business to Cultural Studies to Music Performance to History. <em>All</em> interested students are welcome to try the course. We hope you find it useful.</p>",
