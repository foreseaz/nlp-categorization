    "description": "<p><em><strong>\"Much clearer than my Uni's lectures!\"</strong> </em>- Unsuya Karsan</p><p>In this course we'll help you understand the key Econometric theories and in particular give you an intuitive framework to build on. Econometrics can often feel overwhelmingly complicated. This course will give you a solid foundation to prepare for your specific University or College's Econometrics exam.<br></p><p><em><strong>\"</strong><strong>It was really useful, very well explained and interesting. I recommend it\"</strong></em><strong> </strong>- Marius Meza</p><p>With rates for Econometrics tutoring starting out at about $50+ per hour, our price of $74 for over 4 hours of content offers additional value by giving you unlimited access to the material and allowing you pause, rewind, fast forward and generally review the content to increase retention.</p><p><em><strong>\"Excellent explanation! I'm taking an \"Introduction to Econometrics\" course as an undergraduate and most of the time the instructor is long on mathematics and short on intuition. I needed this video to help me grasp why estimators are biased, and you succeeded in doing just that. Job well done!\"</strong></em> - seanch84</p><p>Our aim is to help you fully understand the key Econometrics theories so once signed up, please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you feel there are any topics that you would like more clarity on.</p>  <p>  \t  <strong>COURSE TOPICS COVERED</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  *Learn Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.  </p>  <p>  \t                *Acquire knowledge of Gauss Markov assumptions and theory.  </p>  <p>  \t                *Master Finite Sample Properties of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method (including proof of unbiasedness).  </p>  <p>  \t                *Become competent in Hypothesis Testing (including Normal, t, F and Chi-squared tests).  </p>  <p>  \t                *Grasp Variable Misspecification (excluding a relevant variable, including an irrelevant variable).  </p>  <p>  \t                *Understand Homoskedasticity and Heteroskedasticity.  </p>    <p>  \t<em><strong>\"Truly outstanding. The reinforcement of the global view helped me understand the context and motivation of regression analysis. Plus, the reinforcement of the purpose of the regression intuition made the applied methods logical and easier for me to comprehend and thus learn. Nkaizu's Econometrics course taught me a lot! I wish there were a continuation of this course with advance applications. Thank you nkaizu!\"</strong></em>- Edward Dunn  </p>",
