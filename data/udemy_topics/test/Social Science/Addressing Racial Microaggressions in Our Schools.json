    "description": "<p>  \t  COURSE DESCRIPTION  </p>  <p>  \t  Teachers, consider the possibility that you may unconsciously commit racial microaggressions in the classroom? In an academic setting, racial microaggressions are brief and subtle insults (verbal, nonverbal, and/or visual) directed toward students of color, often automatically or unconsciously. Racial microaggressions in the classroom continue to be a challenge across the country.  Unfortunately, teachers are generally not prepared to recognize racial microaggressions when they occur, or to understand their implications.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course is valuable to all educators who want to learn about racial microaggressions and understand its negative psychological impact on the academic success of students of color. There is significant research documenting the negative impact of racial microaggressions on the psychological wellbeing and academic functioning of students of color. The documented information on racial microaggressions in this course was obtained from research studies, surveys, interviews, focus groups, case studies and testimonials of students of color from across America.  </p>  <p>  \t  Both students and faculty play a role and have a responsibility in creating safe and inclusive classroom environments. This course is helpful to those educators who would like to recognize, address and prevent racial microaggressions in the classroom.  </p>  <p>  \t  Contents and Overview  </p>  <p>  \t  At the end of this course, you will learn:  </p>  <ol>  \t<li>Three types of racial microaggressions? </li>  \t<li>The harmful hidden messages racial microaggressions communicate to students of color?</li>  \t<li>The negative psychological effects racial microaggressions have on students of color?</li>  </ol>  <p>  \t  In addition, you will learn: 1) how your unconscious biases play a major role in how you process your assumptions; and 2) how those assumptions affect how you interact with students of color and, ultimately, communicate racial microaggressions.  </p>  <p>  \t  WHAT'S IN THE COURSE?  </p>  <p>  \t  This course contains lectures, content, resources and videos about marginalized groups' experiences with and responses to racial microaggressions in the classroom.  </p>  <p>  \t  COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  </p>  <p>  \t  Fluent/advanced level of English  </p>  <p>  \t  WHO SHOULD ATTEND?  </p>  <p>  \t  Educators from all private and public institutions interested in recognizing addressing and preventing racial microaggressions.  </p>",
