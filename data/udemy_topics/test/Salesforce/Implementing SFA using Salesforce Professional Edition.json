    "description": "<p style=\"\"><p style=\"\">This is an instructional Salesforce  Tutorial on how to setup and customize Salesforce Professional  Edition for sales force automation (SFA). &nbsp;The course is about six hours  long and is comprised of slides that explains the concepts and annotated video  exercises that demonstrate how to do it. There are nine chapters in total and  some chapters are further broken down into smaller modules and some modules  further divide into parts. &nbsp;Each segment is about ten minutes long with a  few slightly longer and is meant to take in sequence. &nbsp;You should be  logged into your Salesforce account to follow along during the video exercises.  &nbsp;Take this course to make full use of your Salesforce subscription and  learn to customize, manage, and maintain the application on your own.  &nbsp;It&#039;s really easy and not very technical. &nbsp;This course covers SFA in  depth and not service &amp; support nor marketing automation. &nbsp;I will provide  applicable updates when new release come out and will conduct weekly live  sessions at a time yet to be determined and I&#039;ll be online at least once a day  to field question. &nbsp;This course is not meant to prepare you for Salesforce  System Administrator certification but you will be most of the way there upon  completion of this course on Salesforce Development.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
