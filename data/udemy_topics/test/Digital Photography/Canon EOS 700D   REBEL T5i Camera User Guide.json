It is me showing you how to change settings and find features you didn't know about. You can see an example below which will show you the style of recording. Feel free to download a beginners guide to photography and run this along side it so when they tell you to use 'Aperture Priority' this video shows you how. When they suggest shooting a continuous burst of photos, I explain how. What I do cover is some great and practical advice on the settings you should use and I'll do all I can to get you off full auto! </p><p style=\"\">I do mention my other training course <strong style=\"\">FOCUSING</strong> several times as it sits very much along side this one. Focusing correctly is essential and that's why I've created a full course to just that.
