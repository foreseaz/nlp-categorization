But why exactly does a RAW file offer so much more than a jpeg? Why can you do certain things with it but not others? Why does it look so... bad at first? Aimed at newcomers to RAW processing, this course, with over 3.5 hours of content, gives you the knowledge you need to take your photos to the next level. Theory, explanation of all the major tools, and 10 extra develop videos (with the RAW files supplied to you for practice) that take you though different workflows. By the end you will know what a RAW file is, what you can, should and shouldn't do with it, and whats more; you'll be able to tackle RAW files with confidence.</p>",
