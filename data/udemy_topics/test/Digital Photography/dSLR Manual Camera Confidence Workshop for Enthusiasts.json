Sometimes at my workshops, I meet people who take great photos but don&#039;t really know how it all happened. Beth&#039;s course will provide the essential building blocks you need so that you don&#039;t take the occasional winner, but lots of them!

I love the &quot;one-on-one&quot; class format you&#039;ve created. I feel like I&#039;m there with you, working through the basics of using my camera in the dreaded &quot;M&quot; mode. Watching your examples and seeing you configure the settings is great. This is like watching Jamie Oliver. Beautifully crafted workshop. This is fantastic for anyone curious about using their camera in manual mode and forming the foundation for future skills. Both Nikon and Canon cameras are used in the course&#039; :-)</em></p><p style=\"\">Altogether, it becomes your <strong style=\"\">7 Step Shoot Flow</strong> - a reliable system you can confidently follow to set up your camera correctly, every time you shoot.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The format</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>The workshop ran face to face for five years and was delivered in a relaxed, fun and conversational style, with a focus on simplicity and just the buttons you actually need. A one-on-one workshop was videoed with Jules, an enthusiast photographer, following the exact same format.
