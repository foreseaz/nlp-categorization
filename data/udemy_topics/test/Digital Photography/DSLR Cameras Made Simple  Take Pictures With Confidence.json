You&#039;re probably full of creative ideas but frustrated at how complicated it all seems to take a picture on your DSLR and overwhelmed by menu choices and buttons.</p><p style=\"\">This course will show you how simple the basics of your DSLR really are and teach you how your camera really works. We&#039;ll learn about basic settings and use your new technical understanding to take creative and artistic photographs. By the end of the course you will be able to control the camera rather than the camera controlling you!</p>",
