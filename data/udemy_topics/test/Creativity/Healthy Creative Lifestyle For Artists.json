Actually,</strong><strong style=\"\"> they can have</strong><strong style=\"\"> too big of an impact if we’re not careful. </strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">In</strong><strong style=\"\"> this course we’re going to talk about:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t   ·How establishing healthy practices and routines (like getting enough sleep every night or making a cup of hot tea before you sit down to create) can help you maintain your focus and get you out of ruts and into a creative mindset that’s not dependent upon random bursts of inspiration  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t <strong style=\"\">Without a healthy lifestyle:</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t   You feel drained, tired, sometimes jealous of others’ successes  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t <strong style=\"\">With a healthy lifestyle:</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t   You better understand how and why you create your own art  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t   You learn to prioritize your art and set aside time to create, even in the busiest week  \t</p>  \t<p style=\"\">  \t\t   You trust that even when you get knocked down you’ll be able to take feedback in a way that lets you get back up again and keep moving toward your creative vision for the future  \t</p>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">I know the creative journey can be hard and confusing at times, but in the end it’s absolutely worth the effort. </strong><strong style=\"\">You</strong><strong style=\"\"> have some incredible art inside you that deserves to see the light of day. I look forward to walking through this creative process together!</strong>  </p>",
