You will also need fabric to be used for training as well as your quilt project, thread to match, and batting.</p><p style=\"\">This course covers the absolute basics. I never had anyone to explain any of the quilting process to me and this is designed to cover the remedial steps as a first quilting class. From here you can go onto more in-depth courses or patterns. Good foundations make for a good quilter.</p>",
