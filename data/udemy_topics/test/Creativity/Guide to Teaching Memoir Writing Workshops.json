    "description": "<p>Welcome! I hope that you will find teaching and lecturing on lifewriting (memoir writing) as rewarding as I have! I think you will. It is so rewarding to be your own boss – whether you offer workshops to supplement your income or as a full time job, you will find yourself astounded on a daily basis at the incredible rewards that come when you are spending time with some amazing people. As you learn things in this course, feel free to rearrange and change whatever you like. If you have suggestions that I have not thought of, I would love to hear them!</p><p>In 1999, I began teaching memoir and journaling classes. I have taught workshops at bookstores, senior centers, libraries, community centers, and to individual groups. You can do this to and be a part of preserving history while making money. While teaching Memoir Writing workshops has the potential to become full-time work, it is more likely that you are taking this course to supplement your income or simply because you love lifewriting. Whatever the reason, you won't be sorry you decided to join hundreds of people around the world who are earning money and hearing amazing lifestories.</p><p>Learn how to plan, run, and advertise your memoir writing workshops!
