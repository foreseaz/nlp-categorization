    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Have you ever wondered how you could expand your creativity? How you could step beyond the forces that obstruct inspiration? How to hack your flow?</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                     It has been suggested that it takes <strong style=\"\">10 000 hours</strong> to reach <strong style=\"\">mastery </strong>in a craft. This course will serve as a <strong style=\"\">catalyst</strong> for you on your journey, whether you are a creative person on their journey into their art or an <strong style=\"\">entrepreneur</strong> starting up a business, a <strong style=\"\">catalyst</strong> that accelerates your own <strong style=\"\">mastery </strong>over your<strong style=\"\"> craft, business </strong>and<strong style=\"\"> life</strong>. It is a  course based on the highly rated book:<em style=\"\"> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Creativity-Manual-Johan-Nayar/dp/0957544901\" style=\"\">The Creativity Manual</a> </em>and the 5 steps outlined in the book, <strong style=\"\">Self-discovery, Clarity, Confidence, Momentum </strong>&amp; <strong style=\"\">Reward. </strong>The practical tools are all beautifully interwoven with tales of travel from the author, <strong style=\"\">Johan Nayar</strong> MSc. who is an Evolutionary Psychologist, a World Traveller and Creative Explorer. The course offers deep insights from NLP Master Practitioner &amp; Trainer, <strong style=\"\">Tristan Henri</strong>, and it is the interaction between these two characters that brings the course to life. The stages are as follows:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">1. Self-discovery</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">The first section is </em><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Self-discovery</strong></em><em style=\"\">. Much like a singer must find her voice, any <strong style=\"\">creative</strong> or <strong style=\"\">entrepreneur</strong> must find a style from which they can operate best. We'll cover the following things in each section:</em>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">how creativity evolved in nature</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">an introduction to Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP) and its principles.</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">NLP eye patterns -<em style=\"\"> where do people look when they are lying</em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">perceptual positions-<em style=\"\"> how to gain perspectives on a situation (NLP)</em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">our filters on the world- <em style=\"\">deletion, distortion and generalisation (NLP)</em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">an introduction to the Myers Briggs personality test</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">2. Clarity</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">Now that you know yourself on a deeper level we move onto <strong style=\"\">Clarity</strong>, which is a way to gain <strong style=\"\">focus</strong> on a goal. A person who is striving towards something is much more likely to achieve it than someone moving away. What we'll cover: </em>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">how niching works in nature and its application in business &amp; art</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">why focus is so important in any endeavour</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">an Ayahuasca story</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">effective goal setting using SMART goals</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">personal empowerment by taking responsibility for choice</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">3. Confidence</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">Now that you have gained the focus of where you want to go, it's time to put it all into action. <strong style=\"\">Confidence</strong> will accelerate this process, we will cover:</em>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">status in modern society</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">NLP anchoring -<em style=\"\"> how to access confidence on tap</em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">the success cycle - <em style=\"\">how to be more successful </em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">no failure only feedback- <em style=\"\">how to reframe negativity over 'failure'</em></strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">acting 'as if'</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">4. Momentum</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">With confidence comes a level of <strong style=\"\">flow</strong> which is the state where the real magic happens. In this section we investigate ways to increase momentum, it includes:</em>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">an exploration of planning vs spontaneity</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">how to hack your flow, be in the zone or get in the groove</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">maximizing productivity using the Covey matrix</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">personal editing (NLP) change your unproductive memories</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">continuation of perceptual positions</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">5. Reward</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">In this section you combine all of the above processes into a single, unified force and notice how results begin to manifest all around you. We will cover</em>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> the evolution of reward systems</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">a summary of all the previous sections</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">guest interview with filmmaker Theo Davies</strong></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">further learning</strong></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t                             This course offers a <strong style=\"\">hands on</strong> approach to enhancing creativity and building confidence. You will be leaving the course with so many <strong style=\"\">useful techniques </strong>and a <strong style=\"\">clear direction</strong> over your goals. You will be not only able to flourish in your own endeavours but be an inspirational influence to others.
