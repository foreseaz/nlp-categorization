They can riddle us with self-doubt and trick us into believing a story we tell ourselves: “My writing isn’t good enough, and it’s never going to <em>be</em> good enough” – when that story simply <em>isn’t true</em>. </p>    <p>Welcome to “Writers’ Therapy 1” – the first in a new, groundbreaking series of workshops on the <strong>psychology of writing</strong>, and the mental and emotional challenges writers face. </p>    <p>Taught by writing coach, bestselling author, and professional travel writer Dave Fox, this particular workshop – part one in our series – focuses on writer’s block, self-criticism, emotional overwhelm when writing, and how to write about personally difficult topics. </p>    <p><strong>We’ll explore:</strong> </p>    <ul><li>What writer’s block <em>really</em> is, what it <em>isn’t</em>, and ways to overcome it.</li><li>Why some writers are considered “gifted” and how you can become one of them.</li><li>How to tame your “inner bully” – that gremlin in your head who whispers demoralizing things to you when you write – things you would <em>never</em> say to anyone else. </li><li>Writer’s jealousy: Comparing ourselves to other writers can ignite or stifle our success, depending on what we tell ourselves. </li><li>How to write when writing doesn’t feel good.</li><li>How to start writing again if you’ve been in a rut.</li><li>Writing about emotionally sensitive topics, and deciding how much about yourself to reveal.</li><li>Writer’s overwhelm: From too many ideas and not enough time, to stories that branch off on too many tangents, to the daunting task of starting and finishing books and other large projects. </li><li>Understanding the difference between “perfect” and “good enough,” and establishing a sane middle ground so you can get your good work out there and be more productive.</li></ul><p> <br><strong>Unlike many Udemy courses you just download and watch, this course is interactive</strong>. It includes hands-on journaling exercises to help you get to the root of your biggest mental challenges. In the forums, you’ll be encouraged to share your thoughts and experiences with other writers, to commiserate and share strategies for success – kind of like group therapy but more fun!</p>    <p>Dave also plans to host occasional “office hours” video sessions and <strong>live online chats</strong> where you can ask him questions and get his professional advice. He’ll help you pinpoint and overcome your biggest obstacles as a writer. </p>    <p>He teaches with a mix of practical advice, motivation and encouragement, and a sprinkling of tough love to get your words moving. He laces it all together with anecdotes and experiences from his life as a travel writer and bestselling author, and shares his personal journey to becoming a more confident, more productive, happier writer who <em><strong><em>tripled</em> his hourly freelance income</strong></em> with one client after making one simple change in the way he approached his writing. </p><p><strong> <br>Get on track and write to your fullest potential!<br></strong>If you’ve ever found yourself wondering why your writing wasn’t “good enough,” or worrying whether it was ever going to be “good enough;” if you’ve ever thrown secret mini-tantrums as you stared at your word processor, frustrated that your words weren’t coming out the way you wanted them to; if you’ve ever felt stuck, stalled, or anxious about what you were writing or how you were writing it; if you’ve ever wondered if writing could be easier and more fun; “Writers’ Therapy 1” will help unravel the clogs in your brain and help you write to your fullest potential.</p>    <p><em>(And if you wrestle with challenges such as distraction, organization, time management, editing insecurities, publishing fears, and a long list of other mental challenges that nearly all writers face at one point or another, parts two and three in this Writers’ Therapy series are coming soon!)</em></p>    <p> <br><strong>Sometimes, writing is hard. That’s a reality all writers face. But it doesn’t have to be a confidence crusher.</strong> Knowing how to write to the best of your ability, how to keep growing your skills to new levels, and how to keep writing on days when you’re feeling uncertain, will make writing feel lighter and less arduous. <br></p>    <p>So join us in this fun, high-energy workshop designed to help you tame your mental writing beasts, and <em><strong>become the writer you deserve to be – because <em>you’ve got stories to tell and there are readers out there who are waiting to read them.</em></strong></em></p>    <p><strong>Dave Fox is dedicated to your success and he’s here to help. So sign up today and become a more productive, more confident, more successful, <em><u>happier</u></em> writer than you’ve <em>        <strong><u>ever</u> </strong></em>been before!</strong></p>",
