The fact is, you don't need a publisher's “permission\" to create an award-winning novel anymore. There are hundreds of writers just like me, who spend all day every day creating and writing. But not just for fun, or even a hobby.</p><p>We're making money. Paying bills. Putting the kids through college. Problem is, there are just as many ways to fail as there are ways to succeed — more, in fact.</p><p>That's why I created this course . . .</p><p><strong></strong><strong>&gt;&gt;CREATE YOUR OWN AUTHOR WEBSITE TO ATTRACT 1,000s OF NEW FANS&lt;&lt;</strong></p><p><strong></strong><em>The first step to creating a solid platform, attract readers, establish credibility, and sell your books!</em> <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Start Today</strong></p><p>Before you puts words to paper, you need a place on the web for people to find you. Having your own website up and running is far easier than you may think. </p><em>This  course teaches you how to build your author website so you are ready NOW to connect to your new fans as soon as your first, or next, book comes out.</em><ul><li>Discover how to craft the <em>perfect</em> website name</li><li>Learn how to register your author website</li><li>Find out how to pick a web host</li><li>Learn the benefits of choosing WordPress</li><li>Follow the step-by-step instructions for installing WordPress</li><li>Pick a theme that suits your style and add essential (and some fun!) plugins</li><li>Learn how the professionals do it by critiquing the websites of world-class authors</li><li>Launch your author website and start connecting with new readers and fans!</li></ul><p>... that's it! </p><p><em>You can have your own author website up and running TODAY! <strong>Imagine how great you'll feel looking at your website, showing it proudly to friends and family.</strong></em></p><p>Start adding content and you're on your way!</p><p><strong>Do it Yourself</strong></p><p>Yes, you could spend hours learning how to do this yourself by researching how to do it all on Google or YouTube, and then suffer through trying to sort out the good information from the bad. In addition, you could spend hundreds of hours and dollars attending seminars on the web or in cities far from your home.</p><strong>Or You Could. . .</strong><p>Sign up and take this course and learn the effective and proven techniques for creating a great novel and getting it out to your eager readers. Then, armed with your new knowledge and confidence (and with Lady Luck on your side), you will see that the course is quite a bargain—especially once it pays for itself in increased book sales.</p><strong>Why Listen To Me?</strong><p>I have a Masters in Creative Writing and have taken many, <em>many</em> courses on writing, and I have studied literally hundreds of books about the craft of writing. As far as I am concerned, I have earned me the equivalent of a PhD in writing!</p><p>My teachers (for both the books and in the courses) have been the best of the best. In other words, I've learned from the experts. In addition, I have written all my life: I've been a technical writer, scientific report writer, proposal writer, and after-market software writer (you know, the books you buy at bookstores that <em>really</em> tell you how to use software, with tips 'n' tricks and all that).</p><p>But always and foremost, I am a creative writer—a novelist. I currently have three novels and a collection of short stories available online everywhere. One of my books was an Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award finalist. By early 2017, I will have ten books out—five more novels and another collection of stories. </p><p><strong>I Know Your Pain</strong><br></p><p>But it hasn't been easy. I was once standing where you are today. Not a CLUE how to get started with a website, although I knew I needed one. I was frustrated and had low self esteem because of it. (Frankly, I was embarrassed that I didn't have my own author website!)</p><p>But over time, with a lot of research and help, I figured it out. I share all the knowledge that I have found that works with you in this course.</p><strong>I Can Help You Solve Your Problem</strong><p>What you need is someone to teach you how to do this. Someone I'd wish <em>I </em>had when I started on this journey.<em></em></p><em></em><em>Warning: This course is NOT for everyone!</em><p>This course is not for you if you are looking for a “hands-off\" solution. You do have to \"get your hands dirty,\" so to speak. But it's not scary, and I'll be there with you every step of the way.<em></em></p><em></em><em>No-Risk Trial</em><p>But if you are interested in finding out how to take this essential step to be a REAL writer and a better book marketer (or \"authorpreneur,\" as some people are calling it), try my course risk-free. This course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Should you decide it's not for you, no problem and I thank you for giving it a try.</p><strong>Let's get started!</strong><p>After all that, are you ready to be great? Good! Can I guarantee you will be a successful? Of course not; I can't predict the future nor do I know how much work you will actually do. But if you follow all the lessons in this course, you <em>will</em> have your own awesome author website up and running.</p><p>I'm rooting for you. Your readers (current and yet to come) are rooting for you. So, scroll back to the top of this page, click on \"Take This Course,\" and let's dive in!
