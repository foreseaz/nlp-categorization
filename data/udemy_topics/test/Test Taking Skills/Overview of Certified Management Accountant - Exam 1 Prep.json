I have taught CMA courses and consistently had an 85% to 90% pass rate. One year it was 94%. I have marked thousands of CMA final accreditation exams. I prepared this program years ago to</em><em> mentor many candidates like yourself who are now CMAs.</em></p><p><strong>Passing CMA exams will not be easy.</strong>. <br></p><p>Obtaining your CMA designation - believe me - will pay you BIG dividends for the rest of your career. It did for me.</p>",
