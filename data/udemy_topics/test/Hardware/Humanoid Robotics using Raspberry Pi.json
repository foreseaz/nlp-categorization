    "description": "<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Humanoid Robotics using Raspberry Pi 3 is an advanced course </strong>for those who want to explore in depth in the field of physical computing and Robotics. The course requires basic knowledge of Python programming, Linux commands and obviously, your interest in Robotics.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will learn how to build your own walking Robot from the ground up. This robot will also have obstacle detection feature and will also capture the images of the obstacle.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the first part of this course, I will walk you through the hardware and software requirements so that you can have everything ready with you before working on the project.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the second part, I will teach you how to design the Robot so that it looks like a human. Servo motors will be responsible for the movement of the Robot and we will use some of the sensors to perform different tasks such as obstacle detection and capturing images.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once we are done with the designing part I will be guiding you to write the Robot walking program in python. This section will also include obstacle detection where a green LED will keep glowing while the Robot walks and if any obstacle is found in front of the Robot then a red LED will glow indicating that an obstacle is found.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>One USB webcam will be attached on the head of the Robot so that it can also be able to capture the images.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I will guide you step by step how to go about building these projects. <strong>I will also share the source code with you so that you can replicate the project by yourself.</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to you joining this course.\n\n  </p>",
