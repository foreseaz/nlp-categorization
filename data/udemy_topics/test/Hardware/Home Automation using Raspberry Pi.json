    "description": "<p>This course, \"<strong>Home Automation using Raspberry Pi</strong>\" is for anyone who is interested in building some really cool Home Automation projects using Raspberry Pi. Since it is not a beginner course, the learner needs to have a basic knowledge of Raspberry Pi, Linux commands and basic Python Programming.</p><p>In this course, the learner will learn how to build an <strong>Intruder Detection System</strong>. Whenever there is any intrusion at home or office, it is detected using PIR motion detector sensor, an alarm is produced using a buzzer, an image of the intruder is captured, and an email containing the attachment of the image is sent to the user. A database containing the date, time, and image of the intruder is created and served over a web page using Raspberry Pi as a web server so that the user can access the web page to view the log of all the intrusions that have taken place over time.</p><p>The complete system is subdivided into individual sections and explained with the utmost detail so that it is easy to understand. It also explains the possible applications for such a system and how the learner can customize for his/her home or office. Complete Python source code and PHP code are also included so that the learner can easily replicate the system. </p><p>After completing this course, the learner will know how Raspberry Pi helps us in building home automation stuffs, developed on the core idea of \"Internet of Things\".</p>",
