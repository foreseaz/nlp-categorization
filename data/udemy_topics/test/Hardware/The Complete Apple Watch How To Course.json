Consumer electronics are quickly moving from your pocket to right on your wrist. Smartwatches, like the Apple Watch, allow for more flexibility, alleviating the need to always have a smartphone in hand. Apple Watch is currently one of the best smartwatches currently on the market, packing a heart rate monitor that's highly accurate, a fitness app that's second to none, not to mention a well-tailored watch body, with a plethora of watch-band configurations for personalization. One of the best aspects of owning an Apple Watch is quick, convenient methods of getting in touch with all your contacts via mini software apps that allow you to text, tap, call, and even sketch to your contacts! You can take a quick call on your wrist while on-the-go. You can tap your friend across the room in a party or board meeting to signal that it's time to head out. Text right from your wrist with a few simple taps. Monitor emails. Getting notification sent right to your wrist. Connect with all your friends and favorite contacts whenever, wherever. Control music instantly. There's so much you can do. And as Apple updates the software, the capabilities will only grow from here.</p><p>This course was designed for those that need a jumpstart into the experience. An initial tour. No prior Apple Watch experience required. In this course I start from the beginning. From turning on and pairing the Apple watch. To customizing Watch Faces and communicating from the Apple Watch using Voice Dictation. Then I'll cover a few fun topics like snapping friend and family portraits using the camera remote feature built into the Apple Watch, and even viewing favorite photos in the photos app. Walk away acclimated to one of the newest consumer electronics on the market. This course will get you introduced, comfortable, and confident using your new Apple Watch.</p>",
