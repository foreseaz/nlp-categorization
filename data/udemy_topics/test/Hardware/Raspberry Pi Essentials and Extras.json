    "description": "<p>It may have initially been designed as a teaching tool, but since its introduction, the Raspberry Pi has become an integral part of the hobbyist/maker culture around the world. Projects range from soil moisture detectors to dashboard cameras to Commodore 64 emulators. A Pi has even been sent up to the International Space Station! </p><p><strong>Learn what makes your Raspberry Pi tick!</strong><br></p><p>But one thing that seems to be missing in the sea of projects and books available is an easy-to-understand introduction to some of the communication protocols that the Pi sometimes uses, and how those protocols work. In addition, there are some basic projects that often get missed when someone picks up a Pi and starts tinkering. I designed this course explicitly to fill some of those gaps in general Pi-knowledge.</p><p><strong>Contents of the course</strong><strong>:</strong><br></p><p>In this course, you'll learn:</p><ul><li>How to install the optional Pi camera board</li><li>What the UART protocol is</li><li>How to interface with a GPS module using I2C</li><li>How to turn your Pi into a fully-functioning web server</li><li>Using the Pi as an NFS server</li><li>Putting Windows 10 on your Raspberry Pi</li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you've been interested in picking up a Raspberry Pi but are unsure where to start, or if you've already got one and would like to 'peek under the hood' and learn about some of the useful protocols it can use, then this course is for you! There are code samples included, as well as all lecture notes. I designed the course for beginners to the Pi, but intermediate Pi aficionados will likely learn something as well from the video lectures and code samples.</p><p>When you're done with this course, you'll have a better understanding of just what makes that little Raspberry Pi do what it does so well!</p>",
