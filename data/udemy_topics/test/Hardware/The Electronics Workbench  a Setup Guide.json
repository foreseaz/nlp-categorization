That's because the amateur electronics lab is far more restricted in every respect to the lab of a professional.</p><p>If you are a hobbyist, using a spare room or your bedroom as your electronics lab, <strong>then this course will help you make the most of it</strong>.</p><p>In this course, I will discuss the basic features of an amateur electronics lab <strong>by showing you how I have organised mine</strong>. <br></p><p>I have most of the restrictions of an amateur, and with the exception of a few of the items in my kit, my lab is purely an amateur lab.  </p><p>In each lecture, I present a specific topic and in most cases I demonstrate the use of a tool or instrument. </p><p>Through these demos, I wish to help you gain a working understanding of what these items are designed for. </p><p>You will not become an expert, but you will know enough to know when you need one. </p><p>I am always available to discuss any of the topics I present in this course, so please feel free to ask using the course's discussion tool.</p>",
