    "description": "<p>  \t            What you are going to learn within the next almost 2 hours of my course, which I really hope that you will enjoy, is to demystify the world of PLCs, by examining step by step the basic parts that comprise a modern Programmable Logic Controller.  </p>  <p>  \t            To be more precise, we are going to start  with a small glimpse of the birth of PLC, then we will take a look at the “heart” of a PLC, see what are the basic staff that a PLC is made of, and later on we will examine PLC’s mind, in order to “capture” the key elements inside PLC programming languages and IEC 61131-3 standard...  </p>  <p>  \t            Finally when we finish this course above all I hope that you will know what is neccessary to be able to start implementing a 5S methodology in PLC programming.  </p>  <p>  \t            What i have learned from all my years of experience is, that it doesn’t matter if you are an electrician, an academic, or an IT programmer…  </p>  <p>  \t            What really makes the difference is, having someone to show you the easiest way, on how to be clear and methodical….since after all “PLC is for everyone!!”  </p>",
