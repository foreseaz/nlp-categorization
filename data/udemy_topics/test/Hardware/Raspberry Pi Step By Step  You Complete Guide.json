In my newest course <strong>Raspberry Pi Step By Step: You Complete Guide, </strong>you will be taken from the very beginning, everything will be covered, starting from why Raspberry Pi board is a way much better than PIC Microcontroller and ending in how you can write a code to control its Pin’s just like in Microcontroller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a credit card sized fully functional computer at a that low price is really worth it, at the end of this course you can turn any idea that you have to a trending <strong>Kickstarter project</strong> and get crowdfunding for it from the online community, Raspberry Pi board will help you a lot in turning your ideas into reality in no time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don’t have a Raspberry Pi board? No problem! </strong>What makes this course really special is the fact that you don’t need the Raspberry Pi Board to be in your hands, there is a full section on how to <strong>simulate the board in your operating system</strong> environment and start learning without getting that board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that you will be able to do at the end of this course:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-       Turn any <strong>old TV into SMART </strong>TV using Raspberry Pi board.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>-       Program a code in python that can take sensor signals as input and send light signals as output, sky will be your new limit (<strong>No previous Programming knowledge is needed</strong>).<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Get inside the <strong>IOT (Internet of Things) </strong>world and start making your own awesome project that can make everybody’s life easier.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>-  Installing <strong>Linux</strong> for the first time and how to deal with it like a <strong>professional</strong>.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>-  <strong>Control</strong> Raspberry Pi board <strong>remotely</strong> with more than three different ways.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>-  Know how Raspberry Pi boards can be used to make <strong>a super computer</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>■Raspberry Pi board provide tons of libraries that make controlling sensors and handling data a really easy job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>■You don’t need to make any PCB, you just need to buy the board and plug it to any screen and you are good to go</p>\n\n\n\n<p>■You will get to practice both programming and electronics with two new gadgets that will add a lot to your knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you take this course now, you can count on these three results in just a few hours!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1-    </strong>Add knowledge into all the new skills you are learning now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2-    </strong>Design and program your ideas into reality as easy as 1 2 3, and this will also help you make great applications using the fast processor inside Raspberry Pi board!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3-    </strong>Use a state of the art design software to reduce the time spent finding the right solutions, since it’s already in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>·         I hope you find this new course useful with Hours of HD Videos explaining <strong>how I am able to create amazing projects with Raspberry Pi boards.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>·         The world needs you to reach your full potential and I am honored to be a part of that with you!<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>This is an introductory course about Raspberry Pi, a credit card sized computer. In this course you will be exploring the possibilities of Raspberry Pi as a computer and a state of the art control machine. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course material and methods does not assume any prior. So If you do not know Linux or Python, no need to worry. The course has sections that cover the basics of Linux and Python where you can get started.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Raspberry Pi comes with many features that most of today’s computer has. The course material will teach you to start using the Raspberry Pi with keyboard, monitor and mouse so that you can use it as a low cost computer. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Interaction with the hardware of the Pi will also be introduced, you will learn by doing, practicing and coding. You will learn from 4 examples. From lighting a LED to reading a switch signal and hocking up a sensor to Raspberry Pi ports, you will be able to write a software program to make the most of your Raspberry Pi, using the Python language. Sounds exciting?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course provides complete code for each example.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will learn how to boot and wire up a Raspberry Pi like a professional.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All of my students can get a special price ($10) for any of my courses.
