    "description": "<p>Arduino has created an open-source, easy-to-use hardware &amp; software platform that has made microcontrollers and electronics accessible to a broad audience of makers. Dozens of variations on the platform exist today, and dedicated devices found in 3D printers, Quadcopters, Media players and robots have bloomed thanks to a diverse ecosystem of vendors and enthusiasts. These devices are following the trend of adding more and more networking and communication capabilities, pushing toward applications on the Internet of Things.</p><p>This course is a guide to the exciting world of internet-enabled microcontrollers using the Arduino platform. Starting with the fundamentals of Arduino programming, the course builds expertise in Analog/Digital Input &amp; Output, and other core topics used to prototype electronic devices. The course then extends the experience by focusing on programming the ESP8266 to scan and connect to pre-existing WiFi networks, or create its own network as an access point. This course features lectures with information to help students build the demonstrations as they go, and challenges students to extend the lecture-provided circuits and code to add additional features. Finally, there is a projects section at the end of the course where new projects will be added to illustrate special topics and techniques, based on student interests and questions!</p><p></p>",
