I show you each part, tell you about the features I thought were important, describe other features you may want to look for, demonstrate how to build the entire computer, and then install the necessary operating system and software.</p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">You will go from having no idea what&#039;s inside a computer to having a full working computer after this course.</strong></p>   You will be able to do the following:   <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Figure out your computer&#039;s main purpose</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Determine which parts you need to buy</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Compare features and benefits of different makes and models of parts</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Buy your computer parts from the most reliable sources</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Put together all of the parts that make up your PC</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Install a Windows operating system</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Install anti-virus software</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Test your built computer is running at optimal temperatures</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Troubleshoot your build in case something didn&#039;t go right on the first try</li>  </ul><strong style=\"\">FAQ:</strong>  <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What operating system do you demonstrate how to install?</strong><br style=\"\">   Windows 7. I am adding a video on how to install Windows 8 and Linux as well.</p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">How much do the parts cost?</strong><br style=\"\">   It depends on what you want to do with your new PC. You can spend anywhere from $300 to $3000 on your build. The first thing to do is to identify the purpose of your computer. Are you going to use it for gaming or video editing, or just basic website browsing and media playback? The more performance your machine is, the more it will cost. We&#039;ve listed out the following sample configurations in the course:<br style=\"\">  </p>    <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Basic PC ($300)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Basic PC ($400)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Gaming PC ($464)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Gaming PC ($800)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Gaming PC ($1500</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Video Editing PC ($1500)</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Home Theater PC ($500)</span></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">How long will I have access to the videos?</strong><br style=\"\">  Forever :) Your access won&#039;t expire&lt;/strong&gt;</p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Do you offer a money-back guarantee?</strong><br style=\"\">  Yes, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you&#039;re unhappy for any reason we&#039;ll refund 100% of your investment. Of course, if there is anything we can do to help you, we&#039;d love the opportunity to do so first.&lt;/strong&gt;</p>    <p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Can I install Mac OS on a computer I build?</strong><br style=\"\">   Yes, the method of actually putting together the computer hardware is independent of which operating system you&#039;re installing. However, Mac OS will only work with a very limited set of hardware, so building a &quot;Hackintosh&quot; is outside the scope of this course.</p>",
