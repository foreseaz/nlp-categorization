    "description": "<p>This course has been created for the <strong>benefit of all sports performers</strong> who want to understand how they can develop their minds for success, just like the world's greatest performers do. The ability to see a sport psychologist is not available to most amateur sports competitors through cost, culture or cost, so the course has been created to overcome these barriers. <strong>Other disciplines such as business, military and high pressure vocations</strong> can use this course as there is considerable overlap.</p><p>The material has been extracted from the scientific literature and packaged into a simpler to understand approach for all students. It is supported by documents, examples and strategies for you to apply. </p><p>There is no doubt from the evidence that if 2 competitors are of equal fitness, technique and physical ability then the one who has worked upon their mental skills will have a considerable edge in terms of becoming victorious.</p><p><strong>The course is structured into each of the 12 mental skills</strong>:</p><ol><li>Professional Attitude</li><li>  Goal Setting</li><li>  Motivation</li><li>  Intensity</li><li>  Concentration</li><li>  Psychological preparation</li><li>  Self Confidence</li><li>  Emotional Control</li><li>  Mental Rehearsal</li><li> Positive Thought Control</li><li> Mental Toughness</li><li>Team Cohesion &amp; Dynamics</li></ol><p>The course has training videos, supporting documents, example You Tube videos and a course narrative. Everything for you to implement is free, quick and powerful in terms of your improvement.<br></p><p>The course can be completed in a few hours but to make lasting change in your life needs you to implement the material and practice on an ongoing basis. It is similar to the gym in so much as the brain muscle needs to be exercised regular so as to make neural changes of a long lasting nature.</p>",
