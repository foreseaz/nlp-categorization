    "description": "<p></p><p>This inline skate course is taught through video tutorials  with accompanying training notes. Nearly two hours of detailed video lessons are  divided into a progressive course syllabus, allowing the skate student to learn  at their own pace through step-by-step instructions, detailed demos and  explanations. The training notes then help to structure your practice in a way  that will lead to safe and continuous learning of new skills. </p>    <p>Learn  how to use the heel brake effectively, how to skate slowly for stability and  then faster for fitness. Learn two different turning methods, beginner and  advanced beginner options. Feel safe and secure at increasing speeds.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The course will take several months to complete depending on  the amount and frequency of practice time available to the student, but itâ€™s far  more efficient than learning by trial and error. Starting with the basics the benefits of learning with this course include knowing  how a skill &nbsp;should look and  feel, understanding the mechanics of what&#039;s going on and creating informed practice time to consolidate the theory that is  learned in the videos.</p><p></p>  ",
