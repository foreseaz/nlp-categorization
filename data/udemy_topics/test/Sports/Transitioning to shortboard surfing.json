Instead of polarizing yourself to one group why not learn both styles to REAP THE BENEFITS!</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>My name is Dalton Brewster and I am a licensed surf instructor in fabulous San Diego, ca. I have been surfing for 10 years and I plan on using my experience and passion to help others make the transition from Long to Short board surfing.
