We know that taping the ankle in the right scenario can provide <strong>support to help keep athletes on the field and playing safely.</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>Yet many sports teams throughout the world <strong>do not have access to a sports medicine professional</strong> who can do this for their athletes.  So what do athletes, coaches and parents do<em> instead</em>?</p>\n\n<ul><li>They <strong>pay</strong> for someone to do it for them.<strong></strong></li><li>They <strong>try</strong> to do it themselves without proper training.</li><li>They <strong>try</strong> to perform a self-taping (dangerous!).</li><li>They <strong>perform the technique incorrectly</strong>, which puts athletes at risk for further injury.</li><li>Or...they <strong>go without</strong>, and play through<strong> pain.</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><em>Unless you know someone with this skill, you will be doing the same thing!</em></p>\n\n<p>But how do you protect your athletes skillfully, effectively, confidently and comfortably?</p>\n\n<p><strong>My name is Ryan Lowery, and I'm a Sports Medicine Professional.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this <strong>comprehensive video course, I sho</strong><strong>w you not only how to tape ankle correctly</strong>, but I also show you <strong>how to do it quickly, skillfully and safely</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You <strong>do not need to be a sports medicine professional,</strong> and you <strong>do not need expensive materials to take this course. A few dollars should get you the supplies needed to get started.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you learn to tape and practice often, you can bring benefit to a wide range of people, including your friends, loved ones, children or others.  <br></p>\n\n<p>Use my experience, my knowledge from 8 years of sports medicine experience (<strong>I've worked with all sorts of athletes from the youth amateur to the professional olympian</strong>), follow my videos and pass my quizzes - and you'll be on your way to helping athletes in no-time!</p>\n\n<p>Your athletes and kids will begin to trust you, and will open up to you about their injuries.  This is so important, because you don't know what could be putting them at risk for injury!  And take it from me...most athlete's don't want you to know they're injured.  <strong>They want to play!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong><em>An impressive ankle taping can sometimes mean the difference between a win and a loss...and between comfort and pain...</em></strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</strong></p>\n\n<p>With ankle sprains happening every season, you may be the <em>ONLY ONE</em> available to add a benefit to your athlete so they can continue to participate.</p>\n\n<ul><li>If you want <strong>to help your athletes</strong>, this course is for you.</li><li>If you want <strong>to help keep your kids safe,</strong> this course is for you.</li><li>If you want<strong> to add to your arsenal of sideline skills</strong>, this course is for you.</li></ul>\n\n<p>It doesn't matter whether you're a coach on the sidelines or a recreational athlete trying to help out a buddy.  You can learn this skill, and I show you how to do it well.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>As with all my courses:</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>You have <strong>unlimited lifetime access through Udemy at no extra costs, ever.</strong></li><li><strong>All future additional lectures, bonuses, etc. in this course are always free.</strong></li><li>There's an unconditional, never any questions asked <strong>full 30 day money-back guarantee.</strong></li><li><strong>Please message me or begin a discussion if you require help or have questions.</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you and enjoy the course!
