    "description": "<p>  \t  This sport psychology course teaches students how to apply sport psychology tools on themselves or others. Everything you need for the course will be provided, including Powerpoint slides and video. Students could reasonably be expected to complete this course over 4-8 weeks if working on 1-2 topics per week. The course is structured to be undertaken sequentially. This course would suit people wanting to learn more about themselves as athletes or coaches, or to see how sport psychologists work with athletes and coaches. The course gives you information, and an opportunity to use this information on yourself or others, but does not include assessment.  </p>  <p>  \t  For students wanting to complete exercises and assessment that might lead to an academic qualification (eg SISSCGP310A &#039;Support athletes to adopt principles of sport psychology&#039; - this course has recently had the course code changed to SISSCO308A to better reflect its Sports Coach content), or complete professional development points for coaching accreditation, I recommend you continue and undertake the assessment for the Advanced Sport Psychology course on Udemy (both the Introductory and Advanced courses are required  to be completed to establish competency).  </p>",
