    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Building and Managing Clusters with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 is a video series designed to present the complexities of Hyper-V and failover cluster configuration in easily digestible chunks. The segments feature demonstrations of the concepts explained in the video, being executed on an actual Hyper-V cluster.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You&#039;ll begin with the basics of setting up your nodes, gathering them into the cluster, and working with your shared storage system. Then you&#039;ll get an in-depth tour of managing your systems using the built-in graphical tools and PowerShell cmdlets. With that foundation, you&#039;ll learn advanced concepts of virtual machine migration and cluster protection. You&#039;ll also discover detailed maintenance steps, such as how Cluster-Aware Updating keeps your nodes patched without impacting virtual machines.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Building and Managing Clusters with Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 will present you with the knowledge and examples you need to successfully design and deploy your own Hyper-V clusters.  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Eric Siron</strong> has over 15 years of professional experience in the information technology field.
