DRS clusters dynamically balance VM CPU and memory demands by automatically <strong>VMotion </strong>migrating VMs experiencing CPU/Memory resource stress. We also look at <strong>Enhanced VMotion Compatibility</strong> (EVC) - a feature that lets you safely mix newer and older ESXi hosts in a DRS cluster</li><li>Next, we will learn how to minimize VM downtime due to unplanned ESXi host failures by implementing<strong> High Availability clusters</strong> (HA). HA clusters monitor ESXi host health, detect ESXi host failures and re-assign VM ownership from failed ESXi hosts to healthy ESXi host peers. We will also learn about key HA policies like <strong>All Paths Down</strong> and <strong>Permanent Device Loss</strong> handling - new to vSphere 6</li><li>We move on to look at how to completely eliminate unplanned VM downtime (even if an ESXi host fails) through <strong>VMware Fault Tolerance</strong> (FT). FT hot replicates a running VM to a peer ESXi host. If the ESXi host running the primary copy of a FT protected VM fails, FT automatically places the replicated copy into service. We'll see how to configure, run and test<strong> FT protected VMs</strong>.</li><li>Next we will see how to use <strong>VMware Update Manager</strong> to safely and efficiently patch and update ESXi hosts. We will learn about <strong>Patch Baselines</strong> (patch sets), how to attach Baselines to an ESXi host or cluster, how to check for patch compliance (all needed patches present on a host) and how to patch ESXi hosts.</li><li>Finally, we will take a close look at<strong> ESXi host and VM performance</strong>. We will see what the VMkernel does to efficiently utilize physical CPU and how we can right size vCPU in VMs. We will see the <strong>five memory management techniques </strong>used by the VMkernel to efficiently manage memory and how to<strong> turn on Transparent Page Sharing</strong> to maximize memory use. We will see how to configure <strong>Storage I/O Control</strong> and how to identify and fix host and VM performance bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>The skills you will acquire in this course will help make you a more effective vSphere 6 administrator.</p>",
