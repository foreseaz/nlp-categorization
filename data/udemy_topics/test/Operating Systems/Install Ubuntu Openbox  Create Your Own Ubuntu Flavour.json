Install a base system using a netinstall.iso file (either burning it out or using a USB)<br> 2. Install Xorg and Openbox<br> 3. General components of a Operating System: taskbar (panel), network manager, file manager, notification mechanism...<br> 4. Install day-to-day using software (web browser, Skype, spreadsheet,...)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each needed packages will have detail explanation why they are used.<br></p>\n\n<p>The course is for those who have already got bored with their Ubuntu/ Linux Mint/ Debian fork systems, or who want to learn more about Linux, or who want to try out Openbox, or who want a lighter yet enough feature and beautiful operating system.<br></p>",
