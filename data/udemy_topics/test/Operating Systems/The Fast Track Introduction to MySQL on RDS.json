I'm an 8yr. accidental DBA and got something out of this course and will take it back to the company. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">-- JD Mulliken</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great course about Azure SQL Database. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">-- G. Begna</strong></p><p><strong>All videos are filmed in 1080 and all audio is crystal clear!!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Note:</strong> The first <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">ten minutes</strong> of every course is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">free</strong>. Please take a moment to watch all the free content. This will help you become familiar with how the instructor will teach the rest of the course. </p>\n\n<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Amazon RDS</strong>) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Relational databases </strong>are complex. In all of my <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">introductory courses</strong> I want to give you a high level look at the product. This <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>isn't</em></strong> a deep dive course. This is a... \"ahhh, that's where I backup my database or limit the user connections.\" This is a... \"ahhh, that's how I install MySQL on Windows\" course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">MySQL</strong> is a full-featured <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">relational database management system</strong></em> (RDBMS) that competes with the likes of Oracle DB and Microsoft’s SQL Server. The RDS cloud implementation is a full featured MySQL RDMS. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">DB instance</strong>. A DB <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">instance</strong> is an isolated database environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">multiple user-created databases</strong>, and you can access it by using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone database instance.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Databases</strong> hold <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">structured data.</strong> It’s important to understand the difference between structured and unstructured data. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">MySQL</strong> is a <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">relational database</strong></em>. The data we place in relational database has structure because <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">we define</strong> how the data is to be stored using <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">data types. </strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the relational database, we model data like products, categories, tags, etc., using tables. A <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">table</strong> contains <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">columns and rows.</strong></em> It is like a <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">spreadsheet.</em> </p><p>Because we deal with a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">large</strong> amount of data, we need a way to define the databases, tables, views, stored procedures and other objects <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">process data more effectively.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your interest in “<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Fast Track Introduction to MySQL on RDS.</strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>See you in the course!!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
