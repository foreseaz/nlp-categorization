(Section 2)</p><ol><li>Just added a new section where we go over the most modern design and prototyping tools.</li><li>We discuss design tools like Sketch 3, Photoshop, and Illustrator, so you can decide what to use.</li><li>Overview of static prototyping tools like Marvel App and Invision</li><li>Overview of granular animation prototyping tools like Pixate, Flinto, FramerJS</li><li>We create a simple design flow using Sketch!</li><li>We put our prototype on Marvel</li></ol><p><strong>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</strong></p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>A quick and practical course on turning your whiteboard or paper sketches into mobile prototypes. Learn to use animations and transitions to convert your static designs into easy-to-understand user flows, products, or features.</p><p>You don't need design skills, software knowledge, or even know how to draw. All you need is some paper, a pen, and an idea—a story waiting to be told.</p><p><span><strong>5 reasons you should take this course</strong></span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Prototyping is powerful.</strong></span> It helps an idea explain itself by letting users play with it.</li><li><span><strong>Drawing is quick and simple.</strong></span> Sometimes boxes, lines, and circles are all you need to describe a product.</li><li><span><strong>You'll have fun taking it.</strong></span> This course is designed for you to finish it as fast as possible and enjoy the ride.</li><li><span><strong>You'll impress your colleagues.</strong></span> We all want to express ourselves, this course will empower your communication skills.</li><li><span><strong>It's free</strong> </span>and it doesn't suck! Seriously, I took some effort to cut what you don't need and just keep the juicy stuff ;)</li></ul><p><strong>So, is this the right course for you?</strong></p><ul><li>The goal of this course is to teach you how to convert your sketches, either on a whiteboard or on paper into a quick and dirty prototype on your phone.</li><li>I built this course for engineers, designers, product managers, or anyone interested in expressing an idea.</li><li>This is for creators that are in the early stages of building an app or feature—teams that want to explore ideas quickly or try different approaches to the same problem</li><li>This is for people that want to test their concept and show it to potential users</li></ul><p><strong>Who am I?</strong><br></p><p>I've worked as a designer for the last 15 years. Now I'm focused on designing web and mobile products, but even with all that experience, sometimes explaining a concept with simple wireframes can be a challenge. Prototyping has helped me bridge that communication gap.</p><p><strong>What this course does NOT cover</strong></p><p>This course does not go into detail about usability or other UX issues. I think it's obvious by now, but this course will not teach you how to code. Remember, this is for people that are in the early stages of building a product or feature.</p><p>If you want to know a bit more about mobile UX or if you want to design a high fidelity UI, then I recommend you take my other course <em><strong>\"Design and prototype an iOS Mobile App on Illustrator\"</strong></em></p><p><strong>What do you need?</strong></p><ul><li>For this course, you only need a marker and a whiteboard, or a pencil and paper</li><li>A smart phone. Either an Android device or an iPhone.</li><li>Downloading the free Marvel App</li></ul><p>This course is quick and practical, and my goal is for you to have fun finishing it. Prototyping has made a huge impact in my work. It's powerful. I'm sure it will help you too.</p><p>So, are you ready to start? Let's do it!<br>HAPPY PROTOTYPING :)</p>",
