If you want to go further with Axure training, contact me for personalised, private training. You can also visit my Ptype website for a link to my newest 9+ hour video course on learning Axure (not available on Udemy).</p>\n\n<p>  \t  This course has around 75 minutes of video content. If you want to pause the videos and try what I'm saying, then it will take you more than 75 minutes to go through.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Through my consulting company, Ptype (formerly known as Brass Flowers), I am one of just a handful of companies (worldwide) approved by Axure as a trainer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Want to be among the first to get updates on my live and video Axure training?

Axure's main competitors are Omnigraffle and Visio for wireframing and JustInMind for prototyping.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Axure easily handles low, medium, and high fidelity wireframes and prototypes. It can also handle data sets, variables, listeners, mobile interactions, and a seemingly endless heap of great features. Clickable interactive prototypes that work on desktop and/or mobile are great for socialising, user testing, and documentation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Axure can publish HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery (not for production servers, please!) and can also generate a variety of spec documents. Published Axure files can be uploaded to your own hosting or straight through the software to the Axure Share site. Axure now lets you host up to 1000 prototypes for free (password protection on each is optional).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Whether you need to show a quick mockup or reproduce a polished product, Axure is a great tool to know well. Many UX employers are starting to look for Axure on resumes! With a great coach (that's me!) and some Axure training, you can expand your skill set.  </p>",
