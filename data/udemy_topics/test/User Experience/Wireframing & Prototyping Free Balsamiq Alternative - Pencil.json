It's not only about the Pencil tool - but also about some cool ideas and good practices for wireframing in general. I specifically like the lectures about creating wireframes for dashboards and for mobile devices.\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><u><strong>Updated to Wireframing and Prototyping course April 2016:</strong></u><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>New wireframing and prototyping for specific use cases section added with videos to show you how to create wireframes in Pencil for specific uses - such as Mobile device app prototyping or for planning Big Data Website Dashboard screen wireframes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>***********************************************************************************</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Are you planning or designing a website, a software product or an application? If you are then creating a great user interface is probably one of the most important factors to the success of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are many tools to design a software user interface. In this course I introduce you to an easy to use, freely downloadable tool called Pencil, and quickly show you how to create user interface wireframes and prototypes by yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Within an hour, you will be able to create your user interface sketches and prototypes, and share them with clients, designers and developers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No prior skills or experience is required to take this course. It takes you all the way from downloading and install the free Pencil tool, through creating wireframes and prototypes and working with all the Pencil tools, and onto saving and exporting your prototype designs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll also find some extra Goodies on the course, such as icons and assets you can add to Pencil, and example wireframe designs to help you get started.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are several paid wireframing tools out there - tools such as OmniGraffle, Blasamiq, Axure and Visio would cost you anywhere from $89 to $600 and more. Before using those, make sure you take this course to be able to try out wireframing by yourself for free. Even if you do plan of using one of the paid tools for wireframing, the skills you will learn and apply through this course will prove invaluable.</p>",
