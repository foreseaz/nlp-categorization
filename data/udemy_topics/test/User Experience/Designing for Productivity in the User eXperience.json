    "description": "<p></p><p>This course is course number <strong style=\"\">D15.2&nbsp;</strong>from a  comprehensive online curriculum on User eXperience (UX) currently under  development by top experts in the field through&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ouxinstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">The Online User eXperience Institute</a>&nbsp;(OUXI).</p>    <p><strong style=\"\">COURSE  CONTENT</strong></p><p>This is an in-depth course on  a particular aspect of designing for the <strong style=\"\">User  eXperience</strong>.</p><p>Overall <em style=\"\">user experience</em> with  software applications and websites is impacted by <em style=\"\">five key qualities&nbsp;</em>of their  user interface:</p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Utility</strong> (is the content/functionality <em style=\"\">useful</em> to intended users?)</p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Usability</strong> (is it <em style=\"\">easy</em> to learn and accomplish tasks?) </p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Graphic Design</strong> (is the visual design aesthetically <em style=\"\">pleasing</em>?)</p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Persuasiveness</strong> (are desired actions supported and <em style=\"\">motivated</em>?) </p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Functional Integrity</strong> (does it <em style=\"\">work</em> smoothly without bugs or crashes?)</p><p>The <strong style=\"\">usability</strong> of a user interface can be further <em style=\"\">subdivided</em> into two separate qualities:&nbsp; </p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Ease-of-learning</strong> (is it easy to <em style=\"\">learn</em> how to accomplish tasks?)</p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Ease-of-use</strong> (can tasks be accomplished <em style=\"\">quickly</em> and easily once learned?)&nbsp; </p><p>The terms ease-of-learning  and ease-of-use are often used interchangeably, but they are <em style=\"\">not the same thing</em>. &nbsp;In fact, they often come into direct conflict  with one another in user interface design.&nbsp;  That is, a user interface that feels easy-to-learn to novices may soon  come to feel tedious and inefficient as they gain expertise, especially if they  are high frequency users.&nbsp; Similarly, a  user interface with a steep learning curve may eventually come to feel  powerful, flexible and highly efficient once a user is trained and using it  frequently.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Ease-of-learning</strong> is usually more important to <em style=\"\">novice, casual </em>or<em style=\"\"> intermittent users.</em>&nbsp; <strong style=\"\">Ease-of-use</strong> is usually more important  to trained, <em style=\"\">high frequency, expert users</em>.&nbsp; However, even casual, intermittent users,  such as users of public websites, will notice – and be frustrated with - designs  that limit their efficiency in obvious ways.</p><p>Two overall topics are  covered in this course:</p><p>·&nbsp;  Efficiency  <strong style=\"\">design guidelines</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;  Efficiency  <strong style=\"\">evaluation techniques</strong></p><p>The course is a very&nbsp;<em style=\"\">concrete,</em><em style=\"\">&nbsp;&quot;how-to&quot;&nbsp;</em>course.&nbsp; Both the design&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;offered and  the evaluation techniques taught have been researched, validated and refined by  the User eXperience discipline over the past 30 years.</p><p>The subset of&nbsp;<em style=\"\">24  design guidelines</em>&nbsp;for efficiency offered in this  course were selected from the full body of knowledge on software and website usability  to be:&nbsp;</p><p>·&nbsp;  Universal&nbsp;(i.e., applicable to most if not all applications  and websites)</p><p>·&nbsp;  Easy  to explain</p><p>·&nbsp;  Commonly  violated</p><p>·&nbsp;  High  impact (on user productivity)</p><p>·&nbsp;  Easy  to implement</p><p>They thus represent the&nbsp;<em style=\"\">&quot;low-hanging  fruit&quot;&nbsp;</em>in designing for software and website user  efficiency. &nbsp;The rationale for each guideline is explained, and clear  examples are offered to enhance understanding.</p><p>Just as with code, usability  design guidelines will only take you so far.&nbsp;  In addition, you need <em style=\"\">evaluation  techniques</em> to assess designs for efficiency to insure an application or  website will meet its business goals at launch.&nbsp;  <em style=\"\">Earlier design changes are always easier  and cheaper than late design changes.&nbsp; </em></p><p>The <em style=\"\">three evaluation techniques</em> taught in this course are: </p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Efficiency heuristic evaluations</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Keystroke level modeling</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;  <strong style=\"\">Efficiency studies</strong></p><p>These different techniques can  be used at different points in the design and development process to exploit  opportunities to improve efficiency in the user interface design <em style=\"\">when it is most cost effective to do so</em>.&nbsp; Learning the evaluation techniques also helps  <em style=\"\">deepen the understanding of the design  guidelines</em>.</p><p><strong style=\"\">COURSE FORMAT</strong></p><p>The course format is a&nbsp;<em style=\"\">PowerPoint  presentation</em>&nbsp;accompanied by a&nbsp;<em style=\"\">studio-recorded  video</em>  of the instructor<strong style=\"\">.</strong>  &nbsp;</p><p>The course includes&nbsp;a little over&nbsp;<em style=\"\">three hours of video</em> (broken into short lectures) with PowerPoint  slides, and&nbsp;roughly  <em style=\"\">1.5 - 2 hours</em><strong style=\"\">&nbsp;</strong>of  optional hands-on&nbsp;exercises<em style=\"\">,</em> for which <em style=\"\">sample solutions </em>are provided.</p><p><em style=\"\">Downloadable  course materials</em><strong style=\"\">&nbsp;</strong>include:  </p><p>·&nbsp;

 Live,  Excel-based&nbsp;<em style=\"\">templates<strong style=\"\">&nbsp;</strong></em>(used  in exercises, and which you can also use as you apply your new skills on real  development projects)</p><p>·&nbsp;  A  handy <em style=\"\">guidelines checklist&nbsp;</em>(for quick reference during design and  evaluation tasks on the job)</p><p>                                                                                                                                                        </p><p>In addition you can request a  <em style=\"\">Certificate of Course Completion</em>, and  participate in a <em style=\"\">question and answer  forum</em> with the instructor and other course subscribers.</p><p>Please feel free to contact the instructor with any questions about this  course at <a href=\"mailto:drdeb@ouxinstitute.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">drdeb@ouxinstitute.com</a>.&nbsp;<br style=\"\"></p><p>Dr. Mayhew is also available for <em style=\"\">coaching/mentoring</em><span> </span>to people who have completed this course and are putting their new skills to work on real projects.
