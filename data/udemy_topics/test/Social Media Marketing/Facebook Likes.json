    "description": "<p>How To Get Facebook Likes - Facebook Marketing starts out with an appealing Fan Page with <strong>social authority.</strong> This means that anyone serious about promoting their own, or affiliate products on Facebook needs to get <strong><em>several thousand Likes as quickly as possible</em></strong><em>. <br></em></p><p><em><span></span></em>There are several ways to do this - some good and some bad. For example, some sites sell 100 Likes for $5. First of all, this can be <em>dangerous</em>. There is no way of knowing how the likes were attributed, and you could easily get your Facebook account banned!</p><p>Secondly, this course shows you how to gain between <strong>80-100 Facebook Likes each and every day</strong> for $1, so why take the risk? Its always best to keep things under your own control and grow a solid business.</p><p>Other sites offer FB Like exchanges, which just eat up your time, or simply don't last. You also have to be doubly certain that this kind of site is legitimate and doesn't compromise the hard work you're putting into your online business.</p><p>You will watch me create an ad from the ground up - the course includes:</p><ul><li>Proof of my own ad results</li><li>How to create the ideal Facebook audience to get 'Likes'</li><li>Setting your budget, so you don't spend too much!</li><li>How to choose or create that special 'Click Magnet' image</li><li>Writing text that matches the ad image and pulls in those Likes</li></ul><p>I demonstrate the exact ad creation that consistently brings me <strong>2500 Facebook likes</strong> to my Fan Page <em>each month</em> - like clockwork!</p>",
