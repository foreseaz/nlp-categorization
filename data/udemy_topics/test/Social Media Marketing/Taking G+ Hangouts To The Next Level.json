    "description": "<p>  \t This course is for anyone who wants to take their G+ Hangout to the next level.  This can be for personal reasons or for professional reasons, with the desire to monetize the hangouts.   No prior knowledge of G+ Hangouts is required as this course will walk you through start-to-finish.  This is not an average course about G+ hangouts as it also covers identifying your objectives, planning your hangout, announcing it, hosting it, and packaging it.  Worksheets are available in most text lectures, guiding you through the inventory process and helping you to identify your objectives.  The course is set out for beginners and those who are advanced and everyone in between.  The amount of time depends on if you require every lecture.  It is also dependent on the objectives that you define for your hangouts (with the guidance of this course).   However the course is approached, it aids in taking those G+ Hangouts to the next level.  </p>  <p>  \tMany of the lectures include worksheets to help you work through the process, as you learn, identifying what works for YOU and not just a cookie cutter replication.  </p>  <p>  \tThere are also many full-length videos of actual hangouts.  The beauty is that you can watch them to get ideas, but, if you are short on time, you can skip them and come back laters.  Section 2, &quot;Creative Uses&quot; is a section on examples, to get you thinking HOW you want to use hangouts.  You can pop back and forth to that section, or skip the uses that do not apply to you and go directly to the following sections to find out HOW to do what you want to do.<br style=\"\">  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Deborah&#039;s Commitment:</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">My commitment, as your instructor, is to provide the information that you need, to be a success.  So, utilize the questions section to ask for more information.  Working in a video studio/sound studio provides the luxury of being able to put together more material to help you out, in your learning process.  Being a full-time video editor (yeah, while being a full-time host and socialpreneur and charting Jazz Singer!) allows me to get those turned-around to you.  Your questions and feedback help me to target exactly what YOU want to learn.  This course is more like affordably-priced, personalized coaching.  So, ask away and I&#039;ll answer you.</em> <br style=\"\">  \t-Deborah  </p>",
