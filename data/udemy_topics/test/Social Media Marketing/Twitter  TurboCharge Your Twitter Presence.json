I'd be happy to take Mike's other course(s) based on this one. I especially appreciate that he is monitoring his courses for out of date information and provided an update on the now defunct Tweetadder. One thing I'd like him to change - all those one question quizzes with very obvious answers after every video. I listen away from my PC while doing chores and it's very annoying to have to keep going back to my PC to answer a simple question. (The one star off was for that reason otherwise 5 stars - it won't bug you unless you are a remote listener)</p><p>NOTE - I'm amazed that Mike let me know he changed the course in response to my original feedback within a few days and the quizzes are less disruptive now - 5/5 rating! \"</p><p><strong>Please note - Quizzes have now been moved to the end of each section. 28.09.15</strong></p><p>--</p><p>Are you not seeing any real benefits from Twitter? When people mention Twitter do you roll your eyes because you are yet to see one new opportunity come your way because of Twitter. Do not worry - you are not alone. <strong>Many people are not seeing a real return on their investment but are reluctant to talk about it for fear of embarrassment.</strong> Even if you are using the platform it is possible that you are missing an opportunity to efficiently do one of the following:</p><p><strong>* Promote your business or organisation</strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>* Raise your individual profile</strong></p><p><strong>*Promote new music or creative work, </strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>* Sell out business and entertainment events</strong></p><p><strong>* Generate more opportunities and contacts</strong></p><p><strong>This course is a step by step guide that will unlock Twitter for you and generate more opportunities.</strong> In the course I will teach you how to use Twitter to generate new opportunities and contacts in an authentic way that your audience will appreciate. You will be able to differentiate yourselves from the masses. </p><p>I have used Twitter professionally since 2010 both on behalf of his clients' businesses and also for my Content Marketing Agency based in London. </p><p>The course is made up of over 2 hours of course material broken down into 28 lectures and 16 short quizzes. </p><p>Take this Twitter course if you want to learn how to use one of the most important Social Media platforms really well rather than trying to be everywhere at once. You will see results in real-time so you can become successful on Twitter very soon. Are you ready? Let's go.</p>",
