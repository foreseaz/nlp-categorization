    "description": "<p>This is a Corporate course for Business, Government and Not for Profits: Save Time: Learn about <strong>autoposting</strong> and <strong>autoscheduling</strong>, natively within Facebook &amp; Twitter as well investigate which social media dashboards are best for automation - Hootsuite, Sprout Social and Buffer. Play with automation software combined with social media dashboards to <strong>autofollow</strong> and unfollow on <strong>Twitter</strong>.

Recommended for <strong>experienced</strong> social media practitioners within organisations, Corporate Government, Not for Profits and small business.  </p><p><strong>*** On April 1st This course will be closed to NEW students. I will of course continue to support current and past students. No new students will be accepted after April 1st****</strong><br></p><p>This course uses many free (e.g. IFTT) freemium (Hootsuite) and low monthly fee tools (meetedgar). We do NOT look at the $40,000 a month tools (use your account manager to give you free training if you are paying that much!). Please do not buy ALL the tools mentioned here - investigate a few and use a mix of free to $25 a month, ones. </p><p>Facebook recently (May 2015) changed the API (the way tools talk to  Facebook) and removed access to posting to groups you are NOT an admin of. I am investigating other solutions, but at the moment NO tool has access to automate posting to a group where you are a member, not an Admin. </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  Thank you John!</strong> \"Just working through your social media automation Udemy course. Been meaning to complete it for ages! Nothing else like it.\" (from Twitter)  </p>",
