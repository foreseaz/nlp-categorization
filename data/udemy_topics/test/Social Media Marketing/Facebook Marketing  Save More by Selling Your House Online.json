Are you wanting to move to a larger place but afraid you will lose too much money selling your current place?  Is there a dream you're wanting to pursue but a hefty mortgage payment is holding you back?</p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Then I have information that you need!</em></p><p style=\"\">In a typical real estate transaction involving an agent for the seller and an agent for the buyer, the total commission paid to the agencies is 6%.  While it may appear that only the seller is paying this fee, both parties are shouldering it because the price has been raised to accommodate the commission amount.  <strong style=\"\">The buyer ends up paying too much, and the seller ends up making too little.</strong></p><p style=\"\">The obvious solution is to cut out the real estate agents and sell the house By Owner.  But how can that be done?  Maybe people are just simply afraid to tackle the process on their own, thinking that it must be very complicated and expensive.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">It's not.</strong></p><p style=\"\">In this course, I will show you how my husband and I were able to sell our home through the power of social media - Facebook, in particular.  Instead of paying $9000 in commission, we paid only $750.  Our total cost of advertising (including everything down to the printer ink) was less than $100, so altogether we paid less than $900 selling our house - <strong style=\"\">a savings of over $8000.</strong></p><p style=\"\">Obviously, I can't guarantee that you will have the same results.  Every market is different, and every home is different.  But isn't it worth a try to potentially save thousands of dollars?  What could you do with that extra money?</p><p style=\"\">Want to know what we did and how you, too, can successfully sell your house yourself?  <strong style=\"\">Enroll today!</strong></p>",
