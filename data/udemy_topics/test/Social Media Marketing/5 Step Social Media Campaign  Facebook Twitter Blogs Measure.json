    "description": "<p>This is a Corporate course for Business, Government and Not for Profits: Perhaps you've got a Facebook Page and a Twitter account and want to build more Likes/Followers or get more Engagement? Or your social media is going great guns but your website sits there unloved and not integrated? You aren't sure what to post on Facebook and Twitter and when - plus measuring seems pretty difficult, with either too much analytics (Facebook Insights) or not enough (Twitter, Instagram etc)?  You'd like to know more about monitoring panels and 3rd party tools but where to start? Building a blog and writing on it seems time consuming and tricky? </p><p><strong>*** On April 1st This course will be closed to NEW students. I will of course continue to support current and past students. No new students will be accepted after April 1st****</strong><br></p><p>This course takes you through step by step</p><ul><li>setting up monitoring panels (check the community groups), </li><li>building a brand voice and content strategy (what to say), </li><li>create discussion lists and hashtags  and engagement strategies for Facebook Optimization (FBO) and Twitter Timelines. </li><li>You will create a blog or business social media newsroom, change the theme, header, write articles and include videos on it. </li></ul>Then integrate the whole lot (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Blog) into a Call To Action campaign complete with measuring tools. <p>This is a great little course to get started on social media in a meaningful way or as a way to upskill from a basic Facebook Page or Twitter that needs more subscribers, engagement and reach. </p><p>I've been running Facebook Pages and other social media platforms for reality shows like Big Brother and Idol and Masterchef over many many years. This is what works and doesn't work for us. </p><p>UNI: Please note, I've been teaching a version of this course at the University of Sydney for the last 10 years - if you are a past student, THIS course is the online version with uptodate tools, videos and tips. Also updated workbooks are available in Section One so check back to see newer versions! </p>",
