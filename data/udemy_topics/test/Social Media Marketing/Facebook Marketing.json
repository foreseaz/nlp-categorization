    "description": "<p style=\"\"><strong>Facebook Marketing Made Easy</strong><br></p><p style=\"\">Facebook Marketing is rapidly gaining strength as this internet giant continues to grow. </p><p style=\"\">Many internet marketers are developing strategies that use memberships of existing communities as an abundant source of clients for their products and services.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>The big question is</strong> - how to turn Facebook users into website visitors and possible buyers?</p><p style=\"\">This course basically teaches the strategy that <strong>I successfully use to market my own product </strong>(blues guitar lessons) on Facebook but can equally be used to promote and sell affiliate products from the Clickbank market place.</p><p style=\"\">In this course you will learn:</p><ul><li>How To create an appealing, <strong>working Facebook Fan Page</strong> - essential for any strategy</li><li>How to <strong>find the audience</strong> for your products</li><li>How to <strong>identify and join niche Facebook groups</strong> interested in your products</li><li>How to make sure your group <strong>postings stay fresh</strong></li><li>How to <strong>automate the whole process</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>I regularly earn between $500 - $800 per month on Facebook</strong> using the exact strategy demonstrated in the course (see screen shots in course promotional video).</p><p><strong>Please note: </strong>This is not a theoretical approach that <strong>MAY</strong> work, but  a verified strategy for <strong>making money on Facebook</strong>. You will learn step-by-step by literally looking over my shoulder as I build a <strong>Facebook Fan Page</strong>, add content, and post on Facebook Groups. <strong> </strong><br></p><p style=\"\">The course is <strong>perfect for beginners</strong> and people wanting to hit the ground running. This <strong>Facebook strategy</strong> works, and in it's basic form costs nothing except time - <em>great for starting out!</em></p><p style=\"\">An example tool that can be used to <strong>automate the whole process</strong> is discussed, with important guidelines for correct usage.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>SPECIAL BONUSES</strong> </p><ol><li>How to create the <strong>perfect Facebook video ad</strong>.</li><li>Detailed explanation - how to get <strong>cheap likes to your Facebook Fan Page</strong></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>More Goodies!</strong><br></p><p>There's even a section covering Youtube video marketing to further increase your reach. As you may know, <strong>Facebook</strong> is rapidly overtaking Youtube as far as views is concerned, and I recommend uploading video for your <strong>Facebook promotions</strong>, rather than just using Youtube video. </p><p><strong>Why?</strong> Well it stands to reason that eventually <strong>Facebook</strong> will start to monetize video and that the search algorithms will behave (probably) in the same way as Youtube does now, so it pays to be ready!</p><p><strong>Facebook For The Future</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Marketers are trying hard to keep pace with any changes made to the Facebook platform, and with this in mind, the techniques taught in this course don't rely on any sensitive rules tat might change from time to time - <strong>it's future proof!</strong></p><p>When there are any changes to basic actions, such as posting on <strong>Facebook Groups</strong> for example, the course will be updated as soon as is possible.</p><p><strong>Facebook Video Ads</strong></p><p>I consider that video will be the Number One marketing tool for <strong>Facebook marketers</strong> in the very near future, so I'll be preparing a separate course showing how to create the perfect <strong>Facebook video</strong> and how to create an ad that delivers leads for around 0.07c.</p><p>However, there are other interesting possibilities on the <strong>Facebook</strong> horizon, such as animated GIFS and Cinemagraphs. GIFS have been around for a long time, and consist of layered images that change quickly, either alternating from one to another, or in a short series.</p><p>Cinemagraphs have a short piece of real video embedded in the image, but the trick is to have just one part of the image moving. The effect is eye-catching. Watch out for Facebook introducing these in the near future.<br></p><p><strong>Related Udemy Search Terms:</strong></p><p>facebook marketing,<strong>facebook marketing strategy</strong>,facebook marketing strategies,<strong>facebook marketing tips</strong>,facebook marketing software,<strong>facebook marketing for dummies</strong>,facebook marketing tools,<strong>using facebook for marketing</strong>,facebook marketing solutions,<strong>facebook marketing services</strong>,facebook marketing plan,<strong>facebook marketing campaign</strong>,facebook marketing company,<strong>facebook marketing tool</strong>,facebook as a marketing tool,<strong>facebook marketing companies</strong>,facebook marketing ideas,<strong>facebook marketing agency</strong>,facebook for marketing,<strong>facebook marketing service</strong>,how to use facebook for marketing,<strong>facebook marketing guide</strong>,social media marketing,<strong>facebook advertising</strong>,facebook and marketing,<strong>facebook affiliate marketing</strong>,facebook marketing apps,<strong>facebook for business</strong>,facebook marketing pdf,<strong>social media marketing plan</strong>,facebook market place,<strong>facebook for business marketing</strong>,facebook business,<strong>social marketing</strong>,advertising on facebook,<strong>effective facebook marketing</strong>,social media advertising,<strong>how to advertise on facebook</strong></p>",
