The course begins with a lecture that identifies the top 5 places you must be online to build your business, brand and influence.  </p>  <p>  \t       The next part focuses on the platforms specifically including additional platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn and Pinterest and building an online content marketing strategy that works.  It&#039;s simple and there are examples included.  </p>  <p>  \t       I created this course because I see entrepreneurs online struggling to build a community and convert their passion into profits.  I also see entrepreneurs experiencing burnout.  Do you need a social media break? How will you know? When social media becomes a chore. When you no longer want to update a post, upload a picture or &quot;check-in&quot; with your community. Social Media is WORK so be sure that you take time out daily to recharge.  </p>  <p>  \t       In this course I provide simple strategies that I use and have used over the years to grow my online community to over 50,000 followers online.  </p>  <p>  \t       Now before you start taking this course, Convince Yourself. I don&#039;t just teach social media, I am actively involved in building my platforms too! What I teach I do and it works.  </p>",
