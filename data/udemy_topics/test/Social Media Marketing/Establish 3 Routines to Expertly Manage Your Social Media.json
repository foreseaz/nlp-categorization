By batching your social media tasks using these routines, you will reduce the time you spend online marketing while also increasing the effectiveness of the content you share. These routines will also instill mindfulness into your social media by emphasizing the need for strategy and goals so you can define where you want to go and how you want to get there. The philosophy behind establishing these routines centers around these guiding principals: focusing on engagement, thinking about the long-term value of every customer, mindfulness leads to better content and batching increases productivity.  </p>",
