Social networks have come and gone (Bebo who…?) but the concept is certainly not going away, and clear winners are emerging.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Twitter is one such winner. It offers a hugely targeted marketing channel which allows you to reach customers directly, building relationships, creating buyers and developing fanatical fans.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t On this course we&#039;ll look at how you can use Twitter to do just that, and how you can fit regularing Twittering into your busy business life. To get started, have a look at the course info section below, and then move on to the daily tasks. I look forward to learning with you!  </p>",
