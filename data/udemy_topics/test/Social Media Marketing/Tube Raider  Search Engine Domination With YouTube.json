The real issue is letting others know that your   site exists so you can attract traffic to it, be that to showcase your   own products and services, give information out for free or if you build   sites to make money through affiliate marketing.</span></p><p style=\"\">WHY WEBSITE TRAFFIC IS NECESSARY</p><p class=\"PIN_1373140264537_hazClick\" style=\"\"><span class=\"PIN_1373140264537_hazClick\" style=\"\">Most   webmasters rely on organic traffic - free traffic that comes in from   the search engines - rather than on traffic that they pay for with the   likes of Google Adwords or Bing Ads.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Being placed highly in the   search engine results pages (SERPs) has a direct bearing on how much   traffic the search engines will drive to your site. If you have the #1   position on Page 1 of Google for a keyword, then you&#039;ll get about 73% of   the traffic that looks at that search results page. The lower down the   page you are, the less traffic will come your way. So it&#039;s vital that   you position highly for your keywords. <br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Traditionally, webmasters   built backlinks to their sites in a variety of ways - blog commenting,   forum posts, article marketing, etc - but it&#039;s a lot of work and it   takes a considerable amount of time. And the results of those efforts   are slow to appear. Using these methods, a site can take anywhere from   1-3 months to percolate up through the rankings. </span></p><p style=\"\">THE BEAUTY OF VIDEO MARKETING</p><p style=\"\"></p><p class=\"PIN_1373126077296_hazClick\" style=\"\"><span class=\"PIN_1373126077296_hazClick\" style=\"\">Using   video to promote your sites is much less labor intensive, is more time   efficient, sees faster results in site rankings and, essentially, gives   you more bang for your buck.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Tube Raider does not teach you how to make videos - there are plenty of tools and courses that will teach that. <br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">What Tube   Raider teaches is a specific strategy for ranking websites high in the   search engines. But more than that, results happen quickly. While videos   rank quickly, sometimes within just minutes of being uploaded, the   ultimate goal is to get those videos to boost your website in the search   engine rankings as well as driving traffic to your website. <br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">The   result is that you can dominate a whole page in Google.
