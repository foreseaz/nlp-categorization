Or you use Facebook brand page to promote your brand or company and want to know the science-backed factors to get more fans, comments, likes, and shares. Or perhaps you run Twitter for a large corporation and want to get more retweets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn the Science-Based Methods of Effective Social Media Marketing:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, you'll learn from three types of lectures:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Short, helpful lessons covering the numerous scientific, quantitative studies that have found what factors lead to more engagement, followers, and purchases via social media marketing and online advertising.</li><li>Practical, hands-on exercises to put these principles into practice by designing social media images and ads.</li><li>\"Behind the scenes\" lectures where I upload the images we've designed together and then confirm the earlier large-scale studies with small-scale tests.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Course Structure and Progression:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, you'll learn and apply the industry-standard design principles, and then you'll learn and apply the science of getting more clicks and engagement. You'll then be amazed by the power of writing appeals, color, and other marketing tips by learning from science-backed marketing secrets confirmed in academic journals. You'll design ads and images throughout the course in order to put these principles into practice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Practical Projects:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to follow along with me exactly in the handful of practical exercises, then you'll need Adobe Photoshop, preferably Creative Cloud, although earlier versions work as well. I also include links to free image editing programs in the course, although for the animated ads lesson, you'll need Photoshop. Of course, if you're only interested in the science-backed marketing tips and you hire someone else to design your social media images, then you won't need the software.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>See the promotional video for my qualifications to teach this course and let me know if you have any questions! Thanks!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
