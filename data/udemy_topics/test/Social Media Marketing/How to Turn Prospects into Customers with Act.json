It&rsquo;s true that most people only use a fraction of the capability of the software they own.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>We don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know, right?</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    If you join me today I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how I&rsquo;ve built a database of over 6000 contacts and made over 1800 connections on LinkedIn using just my Act database.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    This course will reveal the secrets of my success and includes over 5 hours of video tuition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Let me show you how to segment your database into targeted marketing groups and create stylish email campaigns that will generate business from new contacts and existing customers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Each section includes a handy PDF course guide to help consolidate your learning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Before you start your training I recommend you fill out my ACTion Plan, which can be found in Section 1 of the course, so that you can set your targets and get the results you want.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    For best results, have your Act database open at the same time as you watch these videos, you can try things out as you work through each section.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t This course is ideal for anyone who wants to gain more business from their database of contacts and is suitable for:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Business owners</li>\r\n\t<li>Managers</li>\r\n\t<li>Sales professionals</li>\r\n\t<li>Entrepreneurs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t    Please connect with me on LinkedIn and join my <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Act-Social-Media-Marketing-TIps-4832025?trk\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Act and Social Media Marketing Group </a>on LinkedIn where we can share our list building tips.\r\n</p>",
