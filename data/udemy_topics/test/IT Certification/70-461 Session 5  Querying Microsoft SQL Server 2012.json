    "description": "<p>This course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate 70-461: \"Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012\".</p><p>In Sessions 1 and 2, we learned all about dates, strings and number data types and DML statements. In sessions 3 and 4, we created views, procedures, triggers, constraints and combining datasets.</p><p>We'll will now be creating aggregate queries, working through objective 9 of the exam 70-461. We'll be reviewing the ranking functions ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK and NTILE. We'll look at the 8 analytic functions news to SQL Server 2012, such as LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.</p><p>We'll look at alternative ways of grouping and adding totals, using ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS and GROUPING_ID. We'll also look at the geometry and geography data types, plotting locations on a grid, together with functions and aggregates.</p><p>No prior knowledge other than what we covered in Sessions 1 to 4 is required. This course builds on the knowledge previously gained in those previous sessions.</p><p>There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.</p><p>Once finished, you will know what how to write ranking functions, analytic functions, grouping sets and spatial aggregates, and we'll have expanded on our current knowledge of T-SQL.</p>",
