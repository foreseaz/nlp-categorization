This course is designed with the new administrator in mind. I cover each section of the Administrator Study Guide in-depth, giving examples in the interface, as well as hands-on experience so you  can apply the concepts you are learning.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is also the ONLY course on Udemy specifically geared toward the Administrator Certification. If you look at other courses that mention the Admin Certification in their title, you will see lectures lifted from a free Salesforce Developer Workbook and geared toward the now retired Developer 401 certification. I also highly encourage you to verify the instructor's certifications, or lack thereof, by going to certification.salesforce.com and searching their name on the Verification tab. Do the same to verify my certifications, please.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course contains over 11 hours or video instruction. I cover often confused concepts that can trip you up on the Admin Exam, such as the differences between Profiles and Roles, the purpose and use cases for Permission Sets, the different types of Reports and Dashboards, and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I also cover new features in Salesforce that are now on the Admin Exam that you won't find on the other Salesforce courses on Udemy. I cover the Process Builder and Lightning Experience, showing you how to implement it in your own free Salesforce organization.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in becoming a Salesforce Admin, take this course.</p>",
