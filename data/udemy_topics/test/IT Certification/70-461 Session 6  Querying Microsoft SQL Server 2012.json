    "description": "<p>This course is the foundation for the Microsoft Certificate 70-461: &quot;Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012&quot;.</p><p>In Sessions 1 and 2, we learned all about dates, strings and number data types and DML statements. In sessions 3 and 4, we created views, procedures, triggers, constraints and combining datasets, and in session 5 we learned about ranking and aggregate functions.</p><p>We&#039;ll will now be creating sub-queries, working through objectives 7b-e of the exam 70-461. We&#039;ll be created correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We&#039;ll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we&#039;ll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.</p><p>We&#039;ll be looking at functions (objective 14), including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We&#039;ll then complete objective 6 by looking at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and objective 8 by looking at the use of GUIDs. We&#039;ll also look at sequences.</p><p>No prior knowledge other than what we covered in Sessions 1 to 5 is required. This course builds on the knowledge previously gained in those previous sessions.</p><p>There are regular quizzes to help you remember the information.</p><p>Once finished, you will know what how to write subqueries, functions, sequences and more, and we&#039;ll have expanded on our current knowledge of T-SQL.</p>",
