    "description": "<p>  \tThis mini-course is the first of a series of courses that will help you master Windows Server different editions.  </p>  <p>  \tIn this course I start with extracting a Windows image from an installation media and customizing that image. Then I create an answer file for the image and change some settings on that answer file.  </p>  <p>  \tFor this customization I use different tools. I mount the image using DISM and work with that like a simple folder. I use SYSPREP to prepare a customized windows installation for capturing and then I use IMAGEX to capture the image.  </p>  <p>  \tI can add more components to this image and create templates for different roles in my company and finally add this image to a deployment environment such as Windows Deployment Server.  </p>  <p>  \tTo boot into WDS server I need a boot image. I show you how to create this boot image and test it.  </p>  <p>  \tIn the next part of this course I will show you more tools to achieve these goals so stay tuned!  </p>",
