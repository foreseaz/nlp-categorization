Each lecture presents one idea, and gives a brief tutorial on that idea.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                    The course is intended for small business owners, and should take about an hour to complete.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                    The reason I made this course is that local small business owners usually struggle with promoting their business. The first thing people usually think of are Facebook, Twitter, Flyers and business cards to promote their businesses. Those are fine, but there is so much more out there, and so many ways that are more effective.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                    Every lecture in the course discusses a new marketing idea and explains the basics behind it. Obviously I could not go into too much detail on each topic because some topics like SEO or Facebook marketing require their own course (I actually have full courses on those topics!). So this course has a brief tutorial of each of the strategies, and leaves it up to you to take it and run with the ideas presented in the course.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                  In addition to the course lectures, you get my help and advice! Students are able to start discussions and message me with private questions. I answer 99% of questions within 24 hours. I love helping students who take my courses and I look forward to helping you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t              +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                              MONEY BACK GUARANTEE  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>The course comes with an unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee so you can try the course risk free. This is not just a guarantee, it's my personal promise to you that you will succeed ... just like my thousands of other Udemy students.</em>  </p>",
