    "description": "<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>** Chris is the author of the #1 best selling business course on Udemy called \"An Entire MBA in 1 Course.\" ** </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>** ACCORDING TO BUSINESS INSIDER: \"<em>Haroun is one of the highest rated professors on Udemy, so you can expect to be in good hands through the course of your education</em>.\" **</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you want an amazing and easy to understand introduction to management consulting? In this course, you will learn what is management consulting, who the largest players are, how they analyze problems, important consulting frameworks that they use, how to get a job in management consulting, how to interview executives and what the pros and cons are of working in the sector. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A free book of the ENTIRE course and much more is included!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>This course is taught by an award winning MBA professor with significant real world experience working at Goldman Sachs as well as in the venture capital, hedge fund and consulting industries (he has founded several companies and sits on several boards). Many business concepts are simply common sense. This course will focus on business concepts that you need to know that might not be common sense. This course makes the general business, accounting and finance process very easy to understand! The professor of this course is also the author of \"<em>101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School</em>,\" which Forbes magazine recently called \"<em>1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now</em>.\"<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contents of this course are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I worked at Citadel and most recently based on my experience at a prominent San Francisco based venture capital firm. I included helpful practical accounting concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill University. Think of this course as a great introduction to accounting based on my undergraduate business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have minimized “boring complicated concepts” in this course in order to keep it as close to reality and as simple as possible. The concepts of this course have been taught by me in many classes at several universities, where the student feedback has been universally and incredibly positive (please see my LinkedIn profile for student reviews / feedback on my teaching style/effectiveness - thank you. Also please see reviews of my books in Amazon and here in Udemy on my teaching - particularly in my Udemy course on \"<em>101 Crucial Lessons They Don't Teach You in Business School</em>,\").</p>",
