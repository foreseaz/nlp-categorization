    "description": "<p>Creating High Performance Teams is an on-line workshop designed to provide any team member or team leader with the information and tools needed to both build and maintain highly effective teams.  The course deals with the two sides of teamwork... the technical side and the interpersonal side.  The technical side describes how high performance teams create their goals/objectives, define roles/responsibilities, identify barriers to effectiveness as well as how to work around these barriers, how decisions are made on effective teams, and how decisions are made.</p><p>The interpersonal side of teamwork deals with perceptual differences... why people don't see the world the same and how to bridge the differences, personality differences... which personalities get along and which do not (toxic relationships), and how to get along with every personality style (Versatility).  The last subject discussed in this workshop is how to build trust on team.</p>",
