The true cost of meetings is often hidden. But not anymore. As well as showing you how to facilitate meetings, it gives great protocols for the whole team and for all types of meetings.  </p>  <p>  \tThe principles have been tried and tested in classroom training courses in UK, Scandinavia, Iceland and North Africa, in a mix of global businesses.  </p>  <p>  \tThe short summaries give you the basics, literally, in minutes. The 12 videos and accompanying book are structured in short, 5 minute sections - and you can keep improving from the greater detail whenever you want.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you’re a first time manager, team leader, or business operator and you’re fed up with the time and cost wasted in meetings – click on the link and make meetings work FOR you.  </p>",
