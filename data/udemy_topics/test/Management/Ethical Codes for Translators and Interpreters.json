One also needs to sit for an exam on ethics with NAATI to be accredited), and to acquire one more resource (after the course, if communication flows, the instructor might help with ethical queries, for instance).</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Important: The promotional video brings a joke. Nobody that has taken part in the processes of creation of this course has ever spoken to T.C. or A.J. about it.</strong>  </p>",
