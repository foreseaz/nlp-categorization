    "description": "<p>  \t        In today’s business environment, quality is becoming a defining factor in the success of a service or product. The marketplace is so competitive that quality is used to gain a competitive advantage and not only attract new customers to a service or product, but also retain existing ones. That is why Dr. Juran named this century the “Century of Quality” as it might be the key to keep an enterprise in the business.  </p>  <p>  \t        While quality is a known commodity and highly sought after, there lies some confusion in how to actually attain it, what it means and how an organisation can achieve success with it. There are many organisations which have a quality department, yet does not quite know what said department should do and how it can help the organisation to flourish and improve, and maintain a stronghold in this area.  </p>  <p>  \t        This course will give you a comprehensive introduction to quality for organisations. You may see it as an oxymoron and correctly ask how it can be comprehensive while it is only an introduction.  </p>  <p>  \t        It is comprehensive because it covers all the principles you should know about quality and it is introductory at the same time as it does not deep dive into any of these subjects. At the end of this course you will not be a quality expert or practitioner, but it will give you enough insight into what is required for your organisation and how you can engage ‘quality’, as a function, to improve, to save and to compete in the marketplace.  </p>  <p>  \t        So, if you are business owner, entrepreneur or a manager, regardless of the size of your organisation or type of your service or product, I strongly encourage you to take this training. It gives you a clear understanding of something which is essential for your business.  </p>  <p>  \t        If you already know the subject, or even if you are a quality practitioner, I would like to invite you to still take the course. This training can act as a good refresher because it presents all the fundamentals in a carefully crafted package.  </p>  <p>  \t        And finally, if you are not a manager or quality practitioner, but see the quality professionals working in your workplace and wondering what they do and what their role is, I recommend this course to you too. Don’t forget that quality is a service function. It is the business of helping others. So, at the end of this course you will be able to use the ‘Quality Department’ in your organisation more effectively and progress in whatever you do.  </p>  <p>  \t        This course has five core sections. First of all the definition of quality will be explained. It is one of the hardest concepts to define but it is integral to the training to have a clear definition of quality as it becomes the cornerstone of the following sections.  </p>  <p>  \t        Once we have our definition sorted, we then look at systems and system approach. System nurtures quality. Achieving quality without system is simply a random event which surely enough would not be sustainable. We will also discuss the concept of a Quality Management System and explore the well known ISO 9001 - one of the most common frameworks for quality management system.  </p>  <p>  \t        Then, we will discuss measurement and continuous improvement. As Peter Docker says: “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” or “you can’t improve it”. This section covers the principles of process measurement, product measurement and continuous improvement. The very important concept, “Cost of Quality”, will be explained in this section.  </p>  <p>  \t        And finally we will open the quality toolbox and discover some of the great tools and techniques which are available to predict the future, to avoid failures and to solve the problems when something goes wrong. I will touch the continuous improvement as the core message of quality again and explain it a bit further.  </p>  <p>  \t  Enrol now and I enjoy this training.  </p>",
