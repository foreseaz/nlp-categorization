    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   If you&#039;re sick of blowing your time in pointless meetings, you&#039;re in the right place.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If you want your campus organization or small business to get more done, have more fun, and be more creative, then your tools are right here.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   My goal is to get you out of at least 10 meetings this year. What will you do with that extra time?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    I&#039;ve put over 15 years of research, interviews, and experience into building a course that will show you how to run an organization like a boss (even if you&#039;re not <em style=\"\">the</em> boss). The techniques in here come from working with campus orgs, faculty, radio stations, record labels, and small businesses of all kinds. Even if you&#039;re not on a college campus, there&#039;s something in here for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course is designed to be flexible. Most of the videos are under 5 minutes! You can breeze through the whole thing in a weekend afternoon, or watch it in bite sized chunks on your commute. Pick the section that is most relevant to you first, or watch all the way through. Then review anything you missed.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   There are ideas on how to run your group, as well as tips on running meetings and improving attendance and participation in events, and motivating your own executive board.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   On the technical side, there are step-by-step tutorials on how to use 5 different software packages (most are free). All you have to do is follow along. If you know how to write an email, you&#039;ve got the technical knowhow necessary to get through this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   There&#039;s also tons of templates, downloads, and bonus reference materials included. Check the intro video for more details!  </p>",
