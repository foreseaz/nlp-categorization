    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     Delegation is often an overlooked management tool.  Do you experience being too busy or overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work you have to do?  Do things come at you a little too fast?  Do you spend too many nights and weekends working? If you answered &#039;yes&#039; to any of these questions or just want to delegate better, join my avatar puppets and me in this course to learn how to overcome normal barriers to delegation and how to carry delegation out in a way that will give you the results you want.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     I will introduce a <em style=\"\">Delegation Worksheet</em> (Microsoft Word document) that I think you will find helpful and a concept called the Onckin&#039;s Freedom to Act scale to help you determine how much authority to provide.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     I have included interaction between the avatars to discuss problems with delegation and an example use of the <em style=\"\">Delegation Worksheet</em>, just to make things a little more fun and interesting.  </p>",
