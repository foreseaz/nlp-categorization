    "description": "<p> \"Change is the only constant in the world\" ~ Heraclitus  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Learn how to adapt to this constant change and get the most of the change process.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Change Management is often a \"process\" that doesn't go according to plan and causes leaders and teams much stress. This is because the people factor is often not taken into consideration. This course offers YOU a solution.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  This course helps leaders and individuals get to grips with understanding the emotional impact of change. The benefits of this are that just by understanding the emotional impact means that the impact of a change initiative is lessened. It focusses on how collaboration benefits the change process and can play a major role in minimising the emotional impact of change.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  One of the main features of this course is its practical nature: in addition to short video lectures you can complete short reflective exercises resulting in an action plan to implement post-course. This means you can make changes back in the workplace that will benefit you and your team.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  In addition to this you have access to me via messages and discussions. Once you joined the course, you will get all updates and new lectures free of charge in addition to supplementary material.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  I am passionate about change management and I'm really keen to engage with students.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Although this course is aimed at people and organizations involved in change management the information can also benefit individuals going through personal changes.  </p>",
