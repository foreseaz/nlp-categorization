    "description": "<p>  \t<span>It comes naturally to us humans to organise ourselves into groups with different purposes. A big part of living in a democracy is that we are allowed to get organised and work for different causes.</span>  </p>  <p>  \tIn this online course I am going to share some strategies for membership-based organisations, organisations which would more or less disappear if their members were not active and contributed their time and other resources.  </p>  <p>  \tA membership-based group or association can only run thanks to volunteers, although some have staff who work full-time for the organisation. You can call them many things: not-for-profit associations, professional associations, networking groups, common interest associations, cooperatives, societies, private clubs, political parties, churches or any other religious groups, student unions or trade unions. All of these groups have in common that without their members they would not exist.  </p>  <p>  \tMany movements worldwide have started after people organised themselves into groups with similar interests. Examples are civic action groups and consumer groups. Without them many things in our world would look very different and new laws and rules that are helping us live better lives might not exist.  </p>  <p>  \tSome groups are local and others are global and present all around the world. Members on a local level often form global associations and then have global, national and local activities. Many hold international events where members and staff can meet.  </p>  <p>  \tI’ve been very active in many groups myself and I’ve learned what works and what doesn’t over the years.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you want active members you have to educate and motivate them. It’s the same with active members as with leaders, they are not born and never will be. It’s up to you as a leader to provide direction and plan for the future.  </p>  <p>  \tBeing active in a membership-based organisation transforms lives and many people find their life purpose in such activity. I think this is a great gift and it’s helping many, many people.  </p>  <p>  \tI hope this short and concise course will help you and make you think in new ways.  </p>",
