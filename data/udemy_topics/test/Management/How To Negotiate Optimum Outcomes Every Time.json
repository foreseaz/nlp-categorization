    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Why don’t negotiations today lead to the best possible outcome for all parties involved while building strong relationships at the same time?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tI mean, think about it.  By definition alone “negotiation” means <em style=\"\">to produce or come to terms by means of an agreement</em>.  As in all parties in agreement while benefiting from the best possible outcome.  Negotiation, by definition, is not about “winning.”  </p>  <p>  \t So why do we approach them this way?  </p>  <p>  \tThe answer is simple…  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Because the traditional approach to negotiations today is completely backwards.    </strong>  </p>  <p>  \tI’m going to prove this to you in the first section of the course when I share with you the exercise I use at every live negotiation workshop I facilitate.  You’re going to love this exercise.  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">Making this one shift in mindset will give you an immediate advantage in your next negotiation.</em>  </p>  <p>  \tIt’s a really fun way to demonstrate why negotiations are doomed before they even start.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">This is why negotiating has become intimidating, stressful, and can often end in conflict.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You see, traditional methods lead to traditional results - and traditional result aren’t good.</em>  </p>  <p>  \tWith the traditional approach, even when you “win”, you lose because you almost always leave something of value on the table (and you may not even know it).  </p>  <p>  \tI have experienced this first-hand.  Before I learned the secrets to negotiating, I suffered the consequences of using traditional methods.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">In fact, in Section Two you’ll hear how a $100,000 thousand dollar negotiation mistake could have been avoided for the price of a cup of coffee!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tYou don’t have to fall into traditional traps that can cost you big time!  In this course, you’ll learn how to avoid these common traps so you can save time, money, and relationships!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Negotiations should be about working WITH the other parties not AGAINST them.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tWorking against the other parties positions everyone as adversaries that leads to manipulation and attempts to over-power each other.  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">This will never build strong relationships or produce optimum outcomes.</em>  </p>  <p>  \tThis leads to the loss of money, time, opportunity, or relationships (and sometimes all of these).  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">It doesn’t have to be this way.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You no longer have to suffer traditional results by following traditional methods.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You no longer have to be intimidated, stressed out, or anxious.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You no longer have to sacrifice relationships.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">You no longer have to settle for less than the best possible outcome.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">This course streamlines and simplifies what has become an overcomplicated process.</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><span>You learn to breakaway from the traditional mindset and revolutionize your approach</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to understand what others really want - not just what they say</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to get others to understand and appreciate what’s most important to you</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to avoid conflict so you can stay focused on an optimum outcome</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to uncover mutual interests so you can align yourself with the other parties</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn the crucial step most people miss before discussing solutions</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to use factual, relevant information to gain the agreement of others</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to redirect demands so you can keep the negotiation on the right track</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to prepare for negotiations</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn how to control and express your emotions as well as deal with other’s emotions</span></li>  \t<li><span>You’ll learn the simple steps you need to take in your very next negotiation</span></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">You will see immediate results.</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><span>Developing the right mindset will give you confidence</span></li>  \t<li><span>Your negotiations will no longer be stressful and intimidating</span></li>  \t<li><span>You will save time in your negotiations</span></li>  \t<li><span>You will negotiate to save and gain more money</span></li>  \t<li><span>You will increase your opportunities</span></li>  \t<li><span>You will build stronger relationships</span></li>  \t<li><span>You will walk away from </span><span>negotiations with a new sense of pride allowing you to enjoy the process!</span></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Don’t just take it from me.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tHere’s what others are saying:  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">Excellent!</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">I have heard a lot of self improvement videos and this is the best so far.
