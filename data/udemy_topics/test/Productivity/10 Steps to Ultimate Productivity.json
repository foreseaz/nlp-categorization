    "description": "<p>This course is laid out to 10 simple steps. Each step is available on video, audio and in\na written form. Each lesson lasts a little over 5 minutes - so it's really short and to the\npoint.\n</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> in the course is about \"Clearing your mind\" and putting everything into your\ntrusted system. We'll talk about Inboxes and how to use them, to make sure your mind\nis focused and nothing gets forgotten.\n</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> is about organizing your tasks into projects. About dividing the big tasks into\nsmall, actionable steps to ensure you'll always get them done. You'll become a project\nmanagement ninja after this lesson.\n</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> is about defining your \"next actions\" - your priority tasks that need to be done\nnext to keep your projects moving forward. You'll learn that sometimes it takes getting\njust one small task done to move an avalanche of a project forward and begin\naccomplishing your goals.\n</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> is about being productive anywhere. Using your computer, smartphone or\ntablet. Today's era of technology enables us to get tasks done anywhere and have more\nfree time later!\n</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> is about collaborating. We live in a connected world and your colleagues as\nwell as your close friends can help you get a lot more done. You'll learn how to share\nprojects, delegate tasks and communicate through them effectively.\n</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong> is about working in contexts - it's a second, and very helpful layer of\nproductivity, where you divide tasks not only into projects, but into places these can be\ndone in, tools these can be done with, and so on.\n</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong> is about managing your reference material and documents. Store your notes and\ndigitize as much content as you can to make sure to have it at hand when you're\ngetting your tasks done. Lots of tricks and apps can help you with that.\n</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong> is about reviewing your recently set up productivity system. At least once a\nweek you need to have a meeting with yourself and review your tasks, projects, lists\nand goals. Learn to start your next week fresh!</p><p><strong>Step 9</strong> is about Email and how to handle it. How to process it to zero and how to\nhandle others' expectations when it comes to an email reply. How to make sure you\ndon't get lost in the flood of email messages coming in.\n</p><p><strong>Step 10</strong> is where I help you start with everything you've learned so far. I will add\nseveral tips and tricks that work for me and point you toward additional materials for\ninspiration for action.\n</p><p>Here they are - 10 steps to building powerful productivity habits that will help you\nachieve your goals, get more done and most of all, enjoy more free time! </p>",
