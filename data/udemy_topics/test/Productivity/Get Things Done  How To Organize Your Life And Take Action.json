Manage Your LIFE And Get It Done (The <em>ACTION</em> Part Of The System)</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  I'm talking <em>everything</em> in your life that demands your time, energy, and resources:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li>What you need to do today</li>  \t<li>What you need to do tomorrow</li>  \t<li>What you want to accomplish next week, next month, this year</li>  \t<li>Those pesky little tasks that need done but take less than 5 minutes to complete</li>  \t<li>Multi-step projects such as creating a product, starting a business, launching a blog, writing a book, planning your anniversary, and so on</li>  \t<li>Decisions, people, and other tasks that you're not prepared to act on today, but need your attention soon</li>  \t<li>Recurring events that you need to take care of weekly, monthly, or yearly</li>  \t<li>Things you learn from books you read, videos you watch, courses you take, and seminars/workshops you attend</li>  \t<li>Lists of actions (processes and checklists) you use on a regular basis to complete a task such as write a blog post, pay your bills, plan a trip, create a video, etc.</li>  \t<li>Dreams you want to acheive in the future</li>  \t<li>More...</li>  </ul>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>2. See And Review All The Elements Of Your Life In A Single Glance (The <em>MAP</em> Part Of The System)</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  It's been said that life is a journey, which is a really accurate way of looking at it.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In life, there are destinations you want to reach, decisions about which roads you want to take, roadblocks that you have to get around, and even dead-ends that lead to nowhere.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  And <em>what's the best tool for navigating any journey</em> - whether you're traveling in car or traveling through life?  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In either case, <strong>it's a map</strong>!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Why?  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Because <em>a map is a tool that is designed to give you incredible clarity</em> - it enables you, at a glance, to see the entire path from where you are now to where you want to go (the big-picture), so you can quickly and easily:  </p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li>Take the best, most efficient route to reach your destination</li>  \t<li>See and navigate around roadblocks and obstacles that sometimes get in the way</li>  \t<li>Avoid dead-ends that take you nowhere and waste your time, energy, and resources</li>  </ul>\n\n<p>  \t                  This is exactly what <em>The Action MAP System</em> does for your life. At a glance, it gives you a unique visual overview of your life, so you see exactly where you're headed and how to take the best path to get there.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  This level of clarity means <strong><u>you move through life with a sense of freedom and forward motion</u></strong> similar to driving on the open road with the 'top down' and 'the pedal to the metal.'  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>The Secret To <em>The Action Map System</em>'s Simplicity, Power And Functionality...</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In a nutshell: <em>The Action Map System</em> is built on the framework of one of the best organizational tools known to man - <em><u>a single mind map</u></em>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  If you're currently a mind map user, you can appreciate the potential of using a system built this way.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  If you're not a mind map user, just realize that there's a reason why virtually all Fortune 500 companies use mind mapping in one form or another - <strong>it's works amazingly well at helping you plan, organize, and take action</strong>!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Because of the way it's built, the entire system scales beautifully, which means that whether you're single, retired, and living on your own private island, or you manage a family and successful business (or multiple businesses), <em>The Action Map System</em> will work for you!  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>FAQs</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em><strong>Q:</strong> What makes The Action Map System different and unique from other systems?</em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>A:</strong> Not only does this system help you manage virtually <u>every</u> element of your life (see list above), but it structures everything <em>visually</em>, and <em>in context</em>, meaning <strong>your life becomes like a map - you see your destinations, how you will navigate to them, and where things exist in relationship to each other</strong> - which is a very powerful perspective for planning and taking action.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em><strong>Q:</strong> </em><em>I'm someone who needs to manage both my personal life and a business - can the Action Map handle both?</em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>A:</strong> Yes, all in a single map!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em><strong>Q:</strong> What if I don't know how to mind map right now?</em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>A:</strong> No problem! I show you where you can grab free mind mapping tools, and I demonstrate the basics of using them - everything you need to use the system I teach in this course.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Become An <em>Action Mapper</em> Today!</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  If you're ready to toss your paper to-do list or smartphone productivity apps for a <u>real system</u> that helps you <strong><em>get <u>life</u> done</em></strong>, then join us today!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong><em>This course comes with a 30-day, money-back guarantee, so try it out, you have nothing to lose!</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \tBe amazing!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Derek  </p>",
