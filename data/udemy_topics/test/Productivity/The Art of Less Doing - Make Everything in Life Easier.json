He&#039;s had a lot of experience in the &#039;art of less doing,&#039;  and was happy to share his tips and tricks with us all. I definitely recommend  taking a class from Ari.&quot;</strong> - Malcom</p>    <p><strong>“I highly recommend this “</strong><strong>Get More Done - Make Life Easier”</strong><strong> class.</strong><strong> Ari has a deep knowledge of digital tools and  methodologies that allow you to accomplish more in less time. I learned a  tremendous amount of things that I plan on implementing in my daily routine -  from clever strategies for things we know we should be already using (email  filters), new tools and services that allow others to accomplish things for you  (virtual assistants). I always had an inkling that technology could help me be  more organized and efficient, if I just knew what tools to use and how to use  them. It can, and Ari is an inspiring example of how to get there. ”</strong> - Michael</p>    <p>If you have trouble managing emails, getting tasks done, managing your  time, making time for personal activities, or having the ability to travel  disrupting your life, this class can help.</p>    <p><a href=\"http://www.lessdoing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Less Doing</a>&nbsp;provides tips and tools for optimizing, automating, and  outsourcing everything in your business and personal lives.
