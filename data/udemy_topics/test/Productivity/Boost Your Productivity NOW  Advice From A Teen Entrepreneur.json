    "description": "<p>You have a lot of goals and ideas. You are confident they will work. However, finding the time of day to make those goals and ideas happen is close to impossible. Open time quickly gets filled up with other tasks that steal our attention from our best goals and ideas.</p><p>Our time matters. We can either use three hours in a given day to surf the TV or achieve a big goal. For a long time, I struggled with being productive myself. I found myself surfing TV and playing video games throughout the day. Even though I wasn't even a teenager at the time, I knew something had to change.</p><p>I created my first blog before I was a teen. Just like any blogger, I wanted more traffic but never found the time to get the traffic. I blamed it on my \"busy\" schedule which consisted of doing homework, watching TV, and playing video games.</p><p>My schedule has gotten much busier since then. I have so much homework from advanced level classes and standardized tests that I didn't have time to watch the TV. On some nights, I stayed up past midnight. Not because I played video games and watched TV, but because I put in meaningful work that mattered.</p><p>Even as my schedule got filled with more work, my blog blossomed. I switched over to digital marketing and quickly loved it. My blog now gets thousands of daily visitors and I have emerged as one of the most followed digital marketing experts in the world. I have created over two dozen different products that range from books to training courses.</p><p>The difference? I stopped making excuses and made my productivity my priority.</p><p>Throughout my journey, I came across some of the best methods to increase my productivity. Those methods are the same reason I am where I am today. Productivity is the key to getting anything done such as writing a blog post or creating your own training course. The more productive you are, the faster you are going to become successful.<br></p>  <p>  \tIn this course, I will reveal the methods I used to go from being unproductive to writing books, creating training courses, and pursuing the life I want to live while in high school on the cross country and track teams.  </p><p>If you are ready to take your productivity and your life to the next level, then click \"Take This Course\" now.</p>",
