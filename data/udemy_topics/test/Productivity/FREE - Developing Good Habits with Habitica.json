You wish you spent more time working towards your goals. But at the end of each day as you ready yourself for bed, if it crosses your mind, you wonder where the time went.</p>\n\n<p>There's a simple formula for success:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\"Every day, make some progress, no matter how small, towards your goals.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>That's it. That's the secret to success. Seems so simple, right? The problem is we don't do that. Our goals slip our minds for days or weeks at a time. We might then try to make some epic progress on it, but then it's all too easy to forget about those tasks for a while until the cycle repeats itself a few weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>The missing ingredient is developing the habit of working towards your goals every day. You need to make time every day to work on things that are important to you. You need to make it normal for you to make progress on your goals and dreams every day, and abnormal for you to miss a day. This is flipping the script. Instead of being the hare in the famous Aesop fable, you become the tortoise. </p>\n\n<p>This is how you eliminate distraction. Reduce the influence of television and other time wasters. Eliminate bad habits and add in good ones. Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to get to the gym on a regular schedule? Do you want to finish all those books you bought but never opened? You can. </p>\n\n<p>Your goals don't have to be financial. That's just one aspect of a balanced life. You can have relationship goals, career goals, health goals, personal development goals, and spiritual goals too. </p>\n\n<p><strong>HabitRPG</strong>, which changed its name to <strong>Habitica</strong>,<strong> </strong>is an online website that turns your habits and task list into a game. Like most role playing games, you have an avatar who starts off low level. As you do your tasks each day, you gain points and gold. You use the gold to purchase stronger weapons and armor. And your points let you gain levels. It's a very simple game concept that turns your life into a game. And makes it easy to get addicted to a game which is actually helping you improve your life!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for signing up for this course on Udemy. The course will always be up-to-date here and nowhere else. I am also available for questions inside the course discussion board.<br></p>",
