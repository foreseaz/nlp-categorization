    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   How to Be More Productive: A Step-by-Step Guide for Entrepreneurs is intended for internet entrepreneurs, online marketers, small business owners, internet publishers and solopreneurs - that is, anyone who wants to get more work done in less time. Productivity is the rate at which work is done, meaning it is a function of time - and time is a finite resource. We all need to use it as productively as possible to make more money and to have more free time. While there are a number of productivity guides that are &quot;all over the map&quot; in terms of tips and strategies, this Udemy course is structured like a funnel - beginning with the &quot;top level&quot; concepts in your business right down to managing day-to-day, hour-by-hour and project-by-project tasks. The goal is a course that &quot;bakes&quot; increased productivity into every level of your business life.  </p>",
