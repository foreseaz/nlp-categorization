So we're only a fraction as productive as we could be. </p><p><strong>And my only goal in this course is to show you the counter-intuitive step by step time management formula we should have learned in school but didn't to reach our time management potential.</strong> </p><p>These are not hard, “pie in the sky” steps. They don't even take a long time to put into action. The truth is they're simple and easy.</p><p>But the results they'll give you is anything but ordinary. </p><p>The truth is that the world's most successful people know how to manage their time.</p><p><strong>What is not knowing these secret principles costing you in time, money, productivity and happiness?</strong></p><p>Here's what you'll learn inside the course:</p><ul><li>The difference between managing your time, and <em>investing it</em> (and why the key to being productive are “investments”) [Lecture 1]</li></ul><ul> <li>How to get that “shoot out of bed, excited for the day” mindset to be more productive in everything you do [Lecture 4]</li></ul><ul> <li>Why rituals are the key to productivity (and the key difference between a ritual and a habit) [Lecture 5]</li></ul><ul> <li>The key to doing what used to take three hours in a single hour [Lecture 7]</li></ul><ul> <li>Advice from the world's most famous management thinker on how to know what to work on in the first place [Lecture 8]</li></ul><ul> <li>What a Roman philosopher from 2,000 years ago can teach you about being more productive (and why it's more important than what anyone is saying today) [Lecture 10]</li></ul><ul> <li>The <em>other</em> 80/20 Rule (and why it's more important than the one everyone talks about) [Lecture 10]</li></ul><ul> <li>How to follow through on this step by step formula AND measure how productive you are (and improve it instantly) [Lectures 11- 12]</li></ul><p>And that's just the first 12 lectures!</p><p>I've also included 24 more bonus videos with specific time management tricks and hacks to skyrocket your productivity. I think you'll get even more out of these, than from the first part of the course.</p><p>These are the same principles I use every day and  I'm so excited for you to go through the course and use them as well.</p><p>Talk soon,</p><p>Brandon</p>",
