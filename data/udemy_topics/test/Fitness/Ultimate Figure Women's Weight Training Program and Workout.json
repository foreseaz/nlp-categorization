    "description": "<p>The course uses quadplexes -- meaning four exercises performed back to back in circuit fashion -- to create huge metabolic demand. <strong>This course is excellent for burning fat, toning your body, sculpting a lean figure, and staying in shape.</strong><br></p><p>You'll see Tracey, who is a mother and works full time, but who uses this kind of training to stay lean year-round, go through each of the exercises a few times, at workout speed, so you can see and learn the full meaning of intensity. I also lecture throughout on how to get the most from your workout.</p><p><strong>The course includes the following:</strong></p><ul><li>A 5-day written program of the full training program, <strong>plus</strong> a 3-day \"intro\" program if you're not ready yet for the full 5-day program.</li><li><strong>Videos going through EVERY quadplex</strong> from the full 5-day program, all in REAL-Time. Tracey goes through each quadplex twice, so you can see it both times. </li><li>Info on what you need if you're thinking of <strong>building your own \"at-home\" training dungeon</strong>.</li><li>Information on how to \"progress\" or \"digress\" movements to tweak the program to your current fitness level.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn ADVANCED Metabolic Training I assign figure athletes.</strong></p><p>The program you'll see Tracey do is actually a very advanced program. She actually does 4 sets of the 4 quadplexes, but honestly that's too much for most athletes<strong>. BUT I also think it is useful to see what advanced training is really like, as so few programs actually show you. You should have something to \"work towards.\"</strong> Yes, there is a difference between how the really successful copmetitors train, and how other people do. Training is about pushing yourself, and that's why I've shown an advanced program, but with info on \"how to get there.\"</p><p>This is the kind of metabolic training I often assign figure athletes and women getting ready to step on stage in a figure or bikini competition. As you'll see, there is no need for cardio on top of this program (especially once you see Day 5!). I used Tracey for the demo because she doesn't just look great when she steps on stage--she looks great year round, and does NO cardio.</p>",
