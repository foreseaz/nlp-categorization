    "description": "<p>This course will take the student from the basics of the anatomy of low-back pain, what causes low back pain and why conventional treatments often don't work. The course will then illustrate a series of techniques and strategies that allow a person to re-balance, re-support, re-strengthen and re-align the spinal, lumbar and sacral regions, in order to achieve pain-free living. The course introduces a revolutionary technique called bio-mechanical torsion - developed by osteopaths for re-balancing and re-aligning the lumbar and sacral regions. It has been clinically used for decades by osteopaths. For the first time, these techniques have been adapted for personal use with a self-guided process to help achieve and maintain pain-free living.</p><p>The course doesn't stop there. Strategies on posture, flexibility, strengthening and more are introduced to facilitate a healthy lumbar and sacral region. Facilities and equipment including swimming pools, pilates balls, inversion chairs, saunas, tai chi, nutrition, meditation, hydration and various back stretching devices are also introduced and explained.</p>",
