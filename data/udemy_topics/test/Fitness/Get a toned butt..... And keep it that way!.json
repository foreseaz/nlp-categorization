    "description": "<p>This course is aimed at anyone who wants that tight, lifted, toned look to their gluts but either didn't get the results they wanted from the gym or can't get to the gym. </p><p>The body moves with set programs of muscle contractions. Due to the way we move in modern life, with lots of sitting, the gluts have tended to be inhibited and switched off. This gives the butt a soft flabby look. By learning to use the gluts to move you forward while walking it will mean your butt gets a natural workout every time you walk. </p><p>This program has many other benefits giving better balance, activating hip stabilising muscles but all of the exercises act to allow the gluts to become more and more active in your everyday life. This means you will gain the toned butt you want and then with almost no effort keep it that way......  Forever!</p>",
