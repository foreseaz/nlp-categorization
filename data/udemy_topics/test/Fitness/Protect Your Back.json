The saddest thing about this whole scenario is many exercise regimens are actually the cause of some of these lower back issues. Is your exercise program one of them? Have you paid a personal trainer to help you with fitness only to end up with lower back pain?<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Protect Your Back was created by a clinician with over 15 years of experience in helping his patients rid themselves of low back problems, permanently! With a clinical and scientific approach Protect Your Back explains and demonstrates how the lower back functions when it is healthy, exactly which exercises break it down and cause injury, how to correct some of these injuries with exercise and most importantly how to train the core (the group of very important muscles that protect the spine from injury) for a healthy and strong low back.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Protect Your Back provides three clinician directed core workouts for the beginner that may have a weak core or may even be in pain and two intermediate core workouts that safely and properly train the core without using any of the “back breakers” exercises that are being used too often in exercise facilities across the country. Let Protect Your Back show you how to properly work your core to save your back.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p>",
