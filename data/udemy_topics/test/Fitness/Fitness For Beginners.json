They don't take a minute to consider what their goals are, if they are exercising the muscle groups that are important to them, if they are doing the exercises properly or if they've structured the exercise program in the most efficient way. In this course we address all of these issues so you can get the most out of your exercise program, you can see the results you're looking for and spend as little time exercising as possible. </p><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>This course is for beginners and people that are consistently exercising but not seeing the results they expected for the amount of work they put in.
