The material of the course is college level<strong> </strong>introductory statistics<strong> </strong>course for students majoring in various fields. <br><strong>Testing statistical hypotheses </strong>is a result of teaching introductory statistics courses for over ten years at the college level. The course is written in an easy to understand way and draw upon several fully solved and explained problems to make it <strong>hands-on and practical</strong>.  Each concept is immediately followed with illustrated examples and solved exercise so that you will learn by doing.</p><p><strong>Content and Overview <br></strong>This course of 17 lectures and 1.5 hours of content is suitable for a college student or anyone interested in understanding statistical tests of hypotheses in a hands-on way, at their own comfortable pace.

In addition, we have quizzes and the forum for questions.</em></strong><br>After teaching statistics for over ten years to college students from various math background and interests, my lectures are designed to address all the questions that introductory statistics students tend to ask and the difficulties related to statistical tests of hypotheses.<br><br></p><p><span></span></p>",
