    "description": "<p>Let me gently introduce you to the wonderful world of organic chemistry. We will learn about homologous series, their functional groups and how to draw the structure of and name the molecules in these series using IUPAC naming rules. The course covers alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, branched chain organic molecules, alkyl halides, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, alcohols and esters.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is Mastering Organic Chemistry Important to Your Future?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Eliminate your fear of organic chemistry </li><li>\n\n</li><li> Build a foundation of understanding</li><li>\n\n</li><li>Improve your grades by applying what you understood in the course</li><li>\n\n</li><li> Revise what you learned at high school for college or university courses</li></ul><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>You will learn about the homologous series in a simple way, with lots of drawings and models to help you get it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>See the molecules come to life in our amazing 3D animations. After a while, you will be able to ‘see’ them in your mind when answering quizzes and questions. </p>\n\n<p>You will be able to follow the step-by-step teaching and see that organic chemistry is not that hard once you know the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The lectures are carefully graded from simple to complicated. Learning progresses in a natural fashion, so you will not feel overwhelmed by the new concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course will help you build a foundation of understanding on which to build your organic chemistry knowledge. The focus will be on real understanding, not just learning a bunch of rules. Naming molecules the right way will become second nature to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course notes will help you create your own summary. If you are unsure how to study organic chemistry, this will be a big help to you. A new, better way to study plus your new understanding are sure to give your grades a boost. Better grades will also improve your chances of being accepted to your first choice college or university.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already in college, or are a professional, and you need a refresher in basic organic chemistry, then this course is for you too!</p>",
