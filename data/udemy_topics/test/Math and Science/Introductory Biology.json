It is up to you how you would like to experience this course, fast-paced for test prep or more slow-paced for learners that want to take their time.  </p>  <p>  \t               The course will cover most major aspects of a course in high school (advanced) or introductory college course.  It can be useful to students (at any level) looking for additional help in biology topics.  </p>  <p>  \t  I have 15+ years of experience teaching biology and chemistry at both the high school and collegiate level.  The course will be taught with an appreciation for life&#039;s processes and applications to the real world will be integrated into lectures.  </p>",
