    "description": "<p style=\"\">Many college-bound students find themselves unprepared for college mathematics courses. Universities nationwide are enrolling a greater proportion of their incoming freshman in developmental/remedial math courses. This course aims to present<em> key fundamental math and algebra skills</em> to help prepare you to succeed and be prepared for college-level mathematics courses.</p>  <p style=\"\">Having a solid grasp of <em>fundamental algebra skills</em> will enrich your college math courses experiences. A variety of teaching techniques will keep you engaged, participating and asking relevant questions that will steer you away from memorizing and guide you to understanding. Study skills will be taught and constant assessment will be introduced to encourage memory retrieval and mastery.</p>  <p style=\"\">This course is structured as a personal learning experience for the student who is learning these concepts for the first time. Video lectures, presentations, quiz assessments, examples demonstrated by audio and visual representations, review and exercises sheets in .pdf format are included to aid and reinforce your learning experience. A variety of examples ranging from easy to challenging problems are displayed and worked for the student to view and review as many times as needed. Each section is equipped with resources that can be printed as reference material and for the student to read and practice on their own. The student will be encouraged to complete assessments throughout course to grant immediate feedback as to how well the student is retaining and learning the information. </p>  <p style=\"\">Most students for whom this course is designed will need to dedicate a minimum of one to two weeks depending on prior knowledge to complete course and complete the coursework provided for the maximum learning effect. Others who may be considered faster learners bringing prior knowledge to the table, may complete in as little as four days if minimal practice is exerted which I do not recommend. </p>Completing <em>Fundamental Topics in Algebra Made Simple</em> will help reduce the financial burden and time invested in college courses that serve as pre-requesites for college algebra courses. Reduce the anxiety and fear of taking another college math course by mastering key fundamental concepts that every college bound student needs to know. Along the way, receive the feedback few courses offer and guidance and engagement from a math professor who cares about your success and wants you to find ease and confidence in math. Join me on your journey to attaining a strong math foundation!",
