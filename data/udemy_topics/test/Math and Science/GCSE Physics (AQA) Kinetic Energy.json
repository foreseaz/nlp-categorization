The Physics\n Boot Camp team has decades of experience of helping students of all \nabilities <em>improve </em><em>their GCSE science grades.</em> </p><p>Before you spend money on a private tutor, try our \ncourse - you can access the course when and where it suits you and the \nwhole unit <em>costs less than one session</em> with a tutor!</p><p>This\n course will cover the essential content from the Kinetic Energy section of AQA's Additional Science and Physics courses. At \nthe end of the course you will be confident in handling the key concepts\n instead of panicking the night before the exam and you'll be able to \navoid the mistakes that everyone else is making, giving you an advantage\n before you even walk into the exam hall!</p><p>In this unit you will learn about energy transfers for moving objects and how to describe those transfers in detail. </p><p>We use our expertise from helping <em>thousands </em>of students to highlight the <em>key areas that you need</em> for your exam, along with helping you <em>avoid the mistakes</em> that everyone else makes!</p><p>Background music: Nicolai Heidlas - Summertime <br></p>",
