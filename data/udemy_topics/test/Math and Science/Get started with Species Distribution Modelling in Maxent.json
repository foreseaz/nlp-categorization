As an ecologist today, you should start looking towards analyzing spatial relationships between species and their environment, and develop your GIS skills. The world of GIS has made ecological research even more interesting, as it expresses results and relationships in visual form. </p><p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of GIS in ecology. In this course, we focus on one of the most powerful predictive models in spatial ecology today...Maxent. The Maximum Entropy Algorithm has been borrowed from other natural sciences and adapted in a really clever way to predict suitable environmental conditions for species across large landscapes. The opinion of researchers puts this algorithm as one of the leaders in terms of predictive accuracy. It is based on Machine Learning, and capable of handling multiple species in one model run. </p><p>In this course, we dive into the basic steps required to calibrate a model in Maxent.</p><p>You will learn the following:</p><ul style=\"\"><li><strong style=\"\">Species Data Preparation: </strong>How to prepare your Species distribution data in excel spreadsheets. More usually than not, we receive species distribution data collected with a GPS device in spreadsheet format. Here you will learn how to prepare this data in the format required by Maxent.</li><li><strong style=\"\">Predictor variable Data Preparation: </strong>How to prepare environmental or predictor variables in the format required by Maxent. Maxent supports only specific formats of data, and we will walk through the process of preparing the data for use in the software.</li><li><strong style=\"\">Download Maxent: </strong>How download and install Maxent and increase the memory usable by the software. Sometimes, your data may be so heavy that Maxent runs out of memory. This course teaches you how to increase the memory available to Maxent.</li><li><strong style=\"\">Setting Maxent for a model run: </strong>How to set up Maxent, and customize the settings to change your model results.</li><li><strong style=\"\">Results Interpretation and Presentation: </strong>How to interpret the results generated by Maxent, and presenting the results in visual form using a GIS environment.</li></ul><p>You will get tips on how to reduce spatial bias in models, and manipulating some of the settings that act behind the scenes to change Maxent&#039;s output.</p><p><u style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">So what are you waiting for?
