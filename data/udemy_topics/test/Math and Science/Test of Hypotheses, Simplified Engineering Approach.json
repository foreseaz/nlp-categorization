A simple engineering approach is adopted with several of examples to explain ideas. The course explains and develop skills toward proper hypotheses formulation and testing methodologies. Major points about hypotheses on the mean and variance of a population are covered.  </p>  <p>  \tFinally, we make the use of both <strong style=\"\">Minitab </strong>and <strong style=\"\">Matlab </strong>software to help us quickly perform our tests. Friendly tutorials are given with examples for both software.  </p>",
