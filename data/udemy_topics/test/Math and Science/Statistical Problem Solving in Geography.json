    "description": "<p>Do you struggle with statistics?  Do you want to obtain a more quantitative background in the use of statistics in geography, environmental science, and GIS.  Or, are you a student who is taking a course in statistics and geography but feel intimidated by the complexities of the subject?  No worries.  I created this class for you.  </p><p>This class will walk you through each chapter of my textbook <em>An Introduction to Statistical Problem Solving in Geography</em>, along with the lecture notes I use in my course.  It is designed specifically for geographers.  So, the course isn't really a math course, but an applied course in statistics for geographers.  </p><p>You can also think of this course as a personal tutoring session.  I will not only go over each chapter, teaching you statistics, but will also work side-by-side with you to use statistical software to recreate examples in the book so that you know how to actually perform the statistical analysis. </p><p>At the end of this course you will know how to apply statistics in the field of geography and GIS.  And many of my students who were initially intimidated by statistics, find they actually love this subject, and have chosen to refocus their career on quantitative geography.</p>",
