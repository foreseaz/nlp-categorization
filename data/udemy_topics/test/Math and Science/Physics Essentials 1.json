    "description": "<p>  \t       INTRODUCTION  </p>  <h5>Why learn Physics?</h5>  <p>  \t         Physics is the fundamental science of everything. It is used to understand the world around us and even inside our bodies.   By understanding physics you are able to learn about mechanics, sound, light, electricity, heat, and atomic structures. It is important to understand the principles of physics and how to apply the methods and techniques to a variety of problems. Studying physics does not merely help you solve problems just for physics. A good understanding of principles in physics will help you to analyze problems, reason logically, and to discriminate between important and irrelevant concepts. Some of the benefits from taking this course to learn physics include:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Flexibility Learning</li>  \t<li>Learning by Watching and Doing</li>  \t<li>Gaining practice solving problems</li>  \t<li>Understand Problem Solving Process</li>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  </ul>  <h5>What this course offers</h5>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Multiple Quiz Questions</li>  \t<li>Learning At Your Own Pace</li>  \t<li>Video Lessons</li>  \t<li>Exercise Files to Work With</li>  \t<li>Myself for Help</li>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  </ul>  <h5>Topics Included</h5>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Newton&#039;s First Law</li>  \t<li>Newton&#039;s Second Law</li>  \t<li>Newton&#039;s Third Law</li>  \t<li>Free Body Diagrams</li>  \t<li>Applying Forces</li>  </ul>",
