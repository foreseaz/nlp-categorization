The course will take you on a journey in which you will learn about automobiles piece by piece. We will take the most common automobile - A Car and then understand its working by taking different parts of it, analyzing it closely and then comprehending how different parts work together enabling the vehicle to move from one point to another smoothly.</p><p>I will <strong style=\"\">not </strong>be using unnecessary jargon and terms that only a car mechanic will be knowing! The journey will be for people from variety of backgrounds. So even if you are a person involved in Biology Lab or in making Android apps, you can happily enroll in the course if you have interest in knowing about Cars,</p><p>The course will be mostly in form of video lectures, where I will be explaining the different components using diagrams on whiteboard. For very complicated diagrams, I will be including images and pdfs so that your understanding can become concrete. It can take a total of 2-2.5 hours for completing the entire course.</p><p>To make this more interesting, <strong style=\"\">I promise to reply to each and every genuine queries of the students, irrespective of the level of toughness of the query WITHIN 24 HOURS! </strong>I wish to have every student enrolled in the class, <strong style=\"\">enjoy</strong> this journey with me.</p><p>At the end of the course, you will have a strong understanding of what happens inside the car and how different components work together in making a car ride comfortable, while moving from one place to another.</p>",
