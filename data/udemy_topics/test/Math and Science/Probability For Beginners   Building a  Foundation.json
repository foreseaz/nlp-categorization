    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t       This is a foundation course for those who want to learn the  fundamentals  of  probability. Beginning  with the definition of probability, the course will gradually introduce various terms and concepts with appropriate worked out examples.Three videos are designed to give a clear picture of various approaches  to  probability.The course also includes a brief note on the history of probability. Building on probability concepts that begin in the middle grades, students use the language of set theory to expand their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound events, attending to mutually exclusive  and exhaustive events.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       The course also provides extra practice problems with solutions on the following topics:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       1. Sample spaces  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       2.Experimental or Empirical probability  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       3. Classical or theoretical probability.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       4. Mutually exclusive and exhaustive system of events.  </p>",
