You can pick and choose the topics that are causing you the most difficulty.  You can also access resources containing practice problems to make sure you understand the material.</p><p><strong>I have been a college math teacher for 14 years, and other than Calculus, Algebra is my most favorite topic in math.</strong>  (Yes, I said it: I love algebra!)  Because I'm super-comfortable with the topic, I know how to explain it in ways that students understand.  I've taught the content many, many times, so I can anticipate areas that tend to give students trouble and make sure that you don't trip over those same spots.</p><p>So, if you're needing some help in your Algebra class, wanting to learn Algebra on your own, or wanting to help others better understand Algebra, I would be honored if you would join me by clicking \"Enroll Now.\"</p><p>See you inside!</p>",
