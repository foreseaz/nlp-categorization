These ideas will be useful to study vector calculus course.  </p>  <p>  \t<br style=\"\">  \t    Topics for discussion are:     1. Double integrals over rectangles.     2. Iterated integrals.     3. Double integrals over general regions     4. Double integrals in polar coordinates.     5. Applications of double integrals.     6. Surface area.     7. Triple Integrals.     8. Triple integrals in cylindrical and spherical.     9. Change of variable in multiple integrals.     achieve goals that you will achieve with this course are:     • Understand the theory behind the multiple integrals     • Solve problems involving multiple integrals.     • Know some of the applications of these integrals.<br style=\"\">  \t<span></span>  </p>",
