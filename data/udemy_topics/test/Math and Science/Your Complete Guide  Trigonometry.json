    "description": "<p>Graphing Trigonometric functions is very helpful in understanding six trigonometric functions as they relate to the unit circle.  This course will not only discuss how to graph trigonometric functions by using transformations but help you understand the characteristics that make up each graph.  Having a solid foundation of graphing trigonometric functions is not only important to your understanding but very helpful for later on when you will be able to use each function to model real life situations.</p>\n\n<p>The course is broken down into three sections with each section containing an overview instructional video, worksheet where each problem has a video showing you how to solve the problem and a quiz at the end to test your skills. This course should take you about a week to complete and is designed to be used not only as an instructional course but as and aide to help you with the course you are currently teaching.</p>",
