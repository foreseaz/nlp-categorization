    "description": "<p>This unit is the second in a High School Geometry curriculum. It teaches basic geometric concepts so that they can be applied to more difficult concepts later on. It can be taken by traditional high school students as well as High School Equivalency (HSE) students who are learning about geometric topics for their equivalency exams (GED, TASC, and/or HiSET).Topics include:</p><p>(1) Points, Lines, and Planes</p><p>(2) Linear Measure and Precision</p><p>(3) Points Between Line Segments</p><p>(4) The Midpoint</p><p>(5) The Pythagorean Theorem</p><p>(6) The Distance Formula</p><p>Each section has a related video, a video quiz, and a section quiz. The video quiz is to be taken along with or shortly after watching the video. The section quiz is to be taken after. To supplement the course, you can use any textbook.</p><p>This course should take approximately five to ten hours to complete.</p>",
