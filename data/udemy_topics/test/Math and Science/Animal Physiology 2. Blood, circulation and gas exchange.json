    "description": "<p>Animal physiology is, to use a common phrase, how animals work. </p>\n\n<p>Animals are, in one sense, machines, and the aim of the science of \nphysiology is to understand how these machines function—what drives \nthem, how they operate, the interaction of the various systems they \ncomprise, and the physical and chemical constraints on how they work.  \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Animals are also organisms, and this course is intended to help you understand how animals work as integrated units, <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">i.e.</em>\n as organisms. We will be concerned with how organisms’ various \ncomponents work to keep an animal alive, with how these are coordinated,\n and how the various types of animals, despite their disparate \nevolutionary histories, solve common physiological problems, sometimes \nin remarkably innovative ways. \n\n  </p><p>This course is the second in a series of courses that, together, would be the equivalent of a one-semester course in animal physiology. I strongly recommend that you take the first course in the series, <em>Animal Physiology 1. Respiration and gas exchange</em>, before you take this course. Subsequent courses in the series are <em>Animal Physiology 3. Digestion and metabolism</em> and <em>Animal Physiology 4. Temperature, water and metabolic rate</em>. </p>This course is intended for the upper-division biology student. It is\n also a good course for graduate students and practicing professionals \nlooking for a brush-up course in animal physiology. I presume that you \ncome into this course with the background in chemistry, physics, \nmathematics and biology that can be reasonably expected of a senior \nbiology student. \n\n  The course consists of about five hours of video clips, parceled into seven lectures. ",
