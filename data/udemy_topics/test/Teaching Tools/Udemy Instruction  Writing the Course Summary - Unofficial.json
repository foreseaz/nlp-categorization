I'm not saying it's impossible, other people have done it, but not overnight, in any case. It really depends on your course content and quality, your teaching style, your care for the students and so on.</p><p>What <strong>I AM</strong> telling you is that if you follow the steps and advices in <strong>THIS</strong> tutorial, your course is going to gain more visibility on Udemy, more students and ultimately, more money. Again, not millions, like others may promise you, but surely a constant, decent, passive income. For example, <strong>I make well over $2500 in average, each month</strong> from Udemy, which I think it's pretty decent. HOW I got from my course launch to earning this much, well, that's another story, a story I'm going to share with you across this course, by giving you the best tips I learned, tested and experienced in the first 6 months after launching my course.</p><p>And the best part is that <strong>you won't have to repeat the tests and mistakes</strong> I made during this time. <strong>I will share absolutely everything I know</strong> about having and growing an Udemy course and I am planning to keep the information relevant and updated.<br></p><p><em><strong>\"Thank you for making this course. I have been struggling with this part of the process and you are making it very clear. I am looking forward to practicing these principles in my courses.\"</strong> by M.R.</em></p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>During this free course you will learn how to <strong>transform your Udemy course from a faded, unattractive and obscure course to a shiny, </strong><strong>engaging selling machine</strong><strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>See My Earnings In The First 6 Months On Udemy, With A Single Course</strong></li><li><strong>Learn How To Create The Best Course Description</strong> On Udemy</li><li><strong>Learn How To Write The Course Goals</strong> On Udemy</li><li><strong>Learn How To Write The Instructor Bio</strong> On Udemy</li><li><strong>Learn About Udemy's Course Quality Standards</strong></li></ul><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></p><p>Please note that this tutorial is <strong>NOT</strong> about how to create the course itself (filming, software, lighting, video editing, audio quality).
