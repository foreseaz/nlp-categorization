    "description": "<p>Idea for this course was born when I found out that most of the courses that are made online are just static pictures with bulletpoints and maybe some background music. There were only few courses here that were really high quality and really catched my attention for more than couple of minutes.<br></p>\n\n<p>Then I asked myself why? Why people are not making professional courses like the ones prepared by real experts on Lynda or Coursera? Why they are satisfied only with like voice track and slides. There is so much more that can be done to get students engagement. And then I started to ask even further … Is it because people think that production costs to much money? Or maybe is it to much effort? Maybe it's because lacking of proper skills? I asked this question to my friends and fellow instructors and they said all of mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's why I want to teach you how to overcome problems connected with lack of skill while acting in front of came &amp; easy tricks how to montage your films without to much effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> I want you to learn how to make really good quality movies with you as the main character and you as your unique selling point skyrocketting your students engagement - this is what this course is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine how much more interesting and engaging courses you can prepare if your can act in them in professional way!</p>",
