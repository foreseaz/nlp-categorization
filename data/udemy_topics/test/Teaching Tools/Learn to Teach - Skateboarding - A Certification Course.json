    "description": "<p>  \t     With this course you will be given the tools to learn how to teach skateboarding. You will learn the basic Teaching Model which serves as your class outline from introduction to review, you will learn how to break down each skill into three easy to understand steps and how to clearly communicate those steps to your students. You will learn how to manage your class effectively and safely. You will learn about what makes for a great teacher so you can become one as well. Live sessions will give you a chance to practice teaching each of the steps. You will be given quizzes throughout the course to reinforce your learning. You will become certified when you pass 80% in each category of a written test based on lectures, a skills test where you send in a video of the 8 moves and a 15 minute video of you teaching three students/friends, how to perform a particular move (such as a manual).  </p>",
