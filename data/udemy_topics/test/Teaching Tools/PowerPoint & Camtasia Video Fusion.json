Many of them are not aware of the intricacies of PowerPoint Design, how having an amazing slide deck can change people's perception of your presentation even before you've spoken a word AND even how using PowerPoint and Camtasia together can produce HQ videos with little financial &amp; time investment.<br></p>\n\n<p>Producing videos to promote your products, business or brand seems like an expensive, time-consuming process. After all, corporations flash stunning videos that they spend 000s of $ to produce with the help of several people. You might have even seen Udemy Promo videos that have a tremendous production quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you could produce videos that look amazing, you can produce yourself in 1/5 of the time and with minimal financial investment? Better yet, what if they drove you real sales whilst increasing your conversions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">PowerPoint &amp; Camtasia Fusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Promo video for one of my other courses drove $200 of sales in the first day of launching.
