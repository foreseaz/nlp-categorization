    "description": "<p>This course is a guide to teaching you how to teach your child the in-depth common core beginning to intermediate fraction concepts and skills.  It is... </p><ul><li>perfect for homeschooling parents and parents of traditionally educated students who want to cut out the middle man and save time and money tutoring your own child with easy to deliver, simple mini-lessons that will quickly increase your child's math performance and that you can replicate with your child at the kitchen table with ease.</li><li>This course is also great for professional tutors and classroom teachers who are looking for concise and effective strategies to use with whole class, small group, or individualized instruction plans. Brand yourself as a highly effective math teacher as your students' math fluency increases markedly.</li><li>With this course, you can do what educators call \"front loading\"-teach your child fractions before they are introduced in school.  This can lead to your child's advancement or acceleration in class.  </li><li>Have a gifted child?  This course could be a perfect fit for your young child to explore now.  Why wait until fractions are introduced in a later grade level?  Take control of your child's learning path and start teaching them fractions, yourself.</li><li>This course is also highly beneficial to students who are struggling to understand fractions.  With ease, you will be able to teach the lessons that fill in the gaps or holes in your child's prerequisite knowledge.  These lessons are yours to keep and access whenever you'd like, so they're available for your child to review whenever they're needed.</li><li>If you choose you can even have your child personally watch the lectures and complete the lessons with or without you.</li></ul><p>The course is comprised of video lessons that teach you exactly how to teach your child each concept.  Each section contains a Build Your Background lesson during which I teach you in detail the why behind each concept or skill being taught in that section.  I use visual aids and models to clearly explain each idea and give you confidence to teach the subsequent lessons to your child.  It is important to take notes and watch the video lessons several times as needed until you feel comfortable moving on to the teaching lessons.  </p><p>The ideal use of this course is to create a daily routine of 10-15 minutes spent on a mini-lesson with your child, teaching the new knowledge in small chunks.  However, the course is ultimately designed in such a way that you can move at your own pace to suit the needs of your child.  The only materials you will need to complete each lecture are pencils and paper.  It really is that simple.</p><p>Sign up now and get in on my introductory discounted price of $49.
