    "description": "<p style=\"\"><p style=\"\">Consistent parent  involvement in education dramatically increases the likelihood  that quality learning will occur. Parents play such a crucial role in their  childrenâ€™s academic, physical, social, and moral development that we, as  teachers, make a huge mistake if we view them as anything other than  indispensable collaborators. It is not enough to keep parents pleased,  appeased, or out of our hair. If we are committed to bringing the best out of  our students, we need to build and maintain long-term relationships of loyalty,  trust, and respect with their parents. Investing the time and effort to work  closely with parents throughout the year maximizes our chances of helping  students reach their incredible potential.</p>    <p style=\"\">This course consists of  nine video presentations. It will take approximately 1-2 hours to complete this  Home and School Connection course.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
