Video editing, scripting, presentation and other skills are covered in other courses in this series.]</strong></p><p>The idea behind this course is very simple: You're about to get a behind the scenes look at how two top instructors on Udemy create their videos.</p><p>Phil and I (Timothy) decided to team up to share how we film our courses with other Udemy instructors. High quality talking head videos are very important for creating courses that keep students engaged.</p><p>When I was starting out on Udemy, I was using a headset microphone and Google Slides with Camtasia to make my videos. I've come a long way since then, and I've decided to team up with Phil, a true expert in the field, to give you a complete guide to getting a home studio set up.</p><p>You'll get to see how Phil and I both set up our video studios, and what your camera options are if you are on a budget. We give you options whether you want to spend $200, $500 or $1000. No matter what your budget, you can get great looking videos that will put you at the top of your category in terms of video quality.</p><p>You'll also learn how to optimize your video production workflow to reduce friction. The ideal situation is that you can walk into your home studio and have everything set up so that all you have to do is turn on your camera, flip on the lights and you are ready to press the record button and go.</p><p>When you are just starting out on Udemy, it may take you weeks just to create a single course. A big part of that has to do with how long it takes you to film all your videos. In this course you'll learn how to speed up your turn around time by reducing as much friction as possible in the video recording process. </p><p>As a student in this course, you'll also have access to both of us, Phil and Timothy, in the discussion section, and you'll be able to ask us all the question you need to help you get your own studio set up. </p><p>We look forward to seeing you in the course.</p><p>Phil and Timothy</p>",
