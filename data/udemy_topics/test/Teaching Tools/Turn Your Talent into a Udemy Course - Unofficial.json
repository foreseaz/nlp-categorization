In my case getting started with Udemy was VERY EASY because I was working in Marketing and specialized in the eLearning sector for about 5 years. </em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">So, I quickly set up my account with other Co-Founder friends of mine and we got rolling creating and managing several other accounts.</em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                    BUT...What if you are <strong style=\"\">ON YOUR OWN</strong>? And have <strong style=\"\">NO EXPERIENCE</strong> in the eLearning sector like I had?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Believe me...YOU CAN STILL TEACH on UDEMY!!!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                    Udemy and myself we believe that everyone knows <strong style=\"\">ONE THING better then others</strong>! We all have one particular talent, don't you? So...why not utilize it and start earning your SECOND INCOME?
