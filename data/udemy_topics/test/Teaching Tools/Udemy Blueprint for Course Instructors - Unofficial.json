Many people think of becoming Udemy instructors, yet very few do. Why is that? I believe that limiting beliefs play an important role and many potential instructors fall in the trap of disqualifying themselves from becoming a part of Udemy. I truly believe the platform's potential is immense and that's one of the things I aim to convince you about in this Udemy Fusion course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I'm Dragos Stefanescu - a Top Udemy Instructor with 10 successful courses, 10,000 students and 360+ Five Star Reviews - and I'm looking forward to teaching you this course.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people live their lives after a common scenario: they finish University when they're in their 20s, get a job, work until they're 65 and retire afterwards. Opportunities for travel are limited those holidays you get every year and most people earn enough to live a good life, but never enough to enjoy life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I truly believe that money is not the end game, no. It's the lifestyle, how you choose to live life on your own terms. And one of the easiest ways to make money online and build a passive income stream is by creating a course on Udemy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you're reading this, chances are you've been thinking of creating a Udemy course. What's stopped you so far?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"But I'm not an expert ?! How can I create a course?\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don't have to be. This is one of the common misconceptions - call it a limiting belief. It's not about how much you know about a certain topic, it's about mastering it and knowing how to create high quality content that delivers results for your students. That's the key. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that's exactly what I teach you in this course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"There's too much competition there, how will I make money?\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's something I was afraid of as well before launching my first course. Trust me - competition on Udemy is the best thing you can have. Embrace the challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"Maybe my course won't be successful, how can I know if I will make money?\"</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know. I can't tell you I'll give you a magic formula to know how much you can make on Udemy. What I can give you is a set of elements to analyse that will tell you exactly if there is a market for your topic. If you create high quality content and market your course properly, you will see results come in very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">My story</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2015 I was stuck in the corporate rat race in a musky London office thinking about how the next 20 years of my life would disappear while I stared at a computer screen for 10 hours a day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided NO MORE and handed in my resignation. Fast forward 7 months and instead I'm standing in front of camera, with over 9,000 Udemy students, 9 Udemy programs &amp; over 200+ 5-star reviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There's nothing special about my story. With hard work &amp; passion you can do the same thing</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What you get in this course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this program you'll learn:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol> <li>Content Design Blueprint: create captivating material that gets students tangible results</li> <li>Course Production 101 : attract raving fans with a top-notch production quality whether you're filming yourself or doing screenshare</li> <li>Udemy Launch Formula: to reach your 6 figure potential through clever marketing and roaring student engagement</li> </ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you will also discover a great number of bonuses such as an entire chapter on Udemy Promo Video creation, audio lectures &amp; course slides, as well as templates for market research, course rankings or promo emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Guarantee</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, there is a 30-day Money-Back Guarantee with this course. But I am confident that you will not need it. If you are not satisfied with the quality of this course, then I demand you contact me on Udemy immediately and I will jump on a 30 Minute Skype call with you to address your issues and help you get the most out of this course.</p>",
