Each individual lecture is a gem, not too long, not too short, with enough meat to get me chomping at the bit to start applying what I just learned right away. Even though he advises the students good enough is better than perfection, it's extremely difficult to not produce a quality course when you apply the instructor's (my favorite part) method of outlining.\" - <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>Tiffany Nguyen</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn how to make a Udemy course.
