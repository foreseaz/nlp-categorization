In this course you will learn about Udemy! </strong></p><p>When I was planning to create a course on Udemy my biggest challenge was where is the data? How can I research and find right topic that will sell! </p><p>I learned quickly that Udemy does not provide any data at all. This is very challenging for any one who wants to make their journey on Udemy a profitable one! No one is telling you want you need to know. They all tell you what could sell. After doing some research I discovered that what Udemy claims to be true is not always true. Because of this Iearned that you also need to get your own data! </p>  <p>  \t<strong>You might think right now is this your only option? </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              Yes, you could invest hours learning how to do this by searching it on Google, buying books and programme courses and studying hours and to test good information from bad information.  </p>  <p>  \t        It is very hard to find any good information about it on Google, there are no courses on Udemy showing you this. But while you waste many weeks of researching you are leaving money on the table.  </p>  <p>  \t        All that time could be invested in making great courses that sells. This course is only $197 and a few hours of your time instead of weeks. And once you use this and create your course it will pay you back instantly!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>  The secret formula for Udemy success  \t            =  \t            Perfect product for a large audience promoted at the right place  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              Udemy is a master in promoting products at the right place. However, Udemy cannot do your push for you! You have to pull your own weight. And in this case it is make sure that the course you make is what your students want. Udemy is doing their job, and you have to do yours!  </p>  <p>  \t              Warning: This course is not for you if only watch a video and do not apply the knowledge in your life. No one can do your push for you! You have to do it by yourself, and it is very easy to follow!  </p>  <p>  \t          ==================================================================  </p>  <p>  \t              <strong>Let me remind you that this is a 100% no risk deal!
