As a company/organization you are accountable to your customers, shareholders, and stakeholders.

It exists in those gaps between expected vs. perceived vs. actual performance. </p><p><strong>The Supply Chain Metrics and KPI's Model</strong> explored in the course help refine strategy, define structure (including human capital), manage processes, and measure performance. Organizations that have embraced and applied this model to help with supply chain problem solving, process improvement, process redesign, or business process engineering, have demonstrated that it is an effective enabler for aligning an organizationâ€™s portfolio of improvement projects with strategic goals and objectives.</p><p>Having developed and implemented a system based on the<strong> Performance Indicators and Metrics</strong> covered in this course you will have the answer to the top five supply chain challenges: superior customer service, cost control, planning and risk management, supplier/partner relationship management, and talent.</p><p>By completing this course you will be able to develop and implement a framework for measuring, understanding and improving your current supply chain conditions and performance, provide the basis for your company to measure how successful it is in achieving its objectives, evaluate cost/performance trade-offs, develop strategies for meeting new customer expectations, and respond to the global market growth and challenges.</p>",
