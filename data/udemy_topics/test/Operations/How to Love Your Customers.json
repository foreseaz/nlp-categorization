    "description": "<p>  \t  Most companies still operate as if they control their customers.  But, in today&rsquo;s market, it&rsquo;s really the other way around.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town, named Customer CEO.  This course is based on Chuck Wall&rsquo;s book, <em style=\"\">Customer CEO: How to Profit from the Power of Your Customers.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t  As businesspeople should we fall in love with our customers? Do you want them to fall in love with you? Or should it be all business, with nothing really personal?  Research proves that people most often switch products or companies for emotional, not rational reasons. The company trying to persuade customers has to connect at a deeper emotional level. The Power of the Heart describes the idea that people are more willing than ever to love, or at least strongly prefer, new brands that &ldquo;love them.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will help you better understand the Power of the Heart with a series of case studies from Lululemon, P&amp;G, John Lewis, UPS, and Jyske Bank.  You will discover the critical importance of telling emotionally powerful stories.  You will also work through two hands-on exercises to better understand how the Power of the Heart will change you.  </p>  <p>  \t  Every student who successfully completes this course will receive a Certificate of Completion.  </p>  <p>  \t  We look forward to sharing much more about the Power of the Heart with you!  </p>",
