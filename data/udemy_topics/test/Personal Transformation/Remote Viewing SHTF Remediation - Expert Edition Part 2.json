    "description": "<p>A lot of my students have asked me about Ed Dames predictions about the “killshot,” a series of massive solar flares that bring civilization to the brink. I have held off, (until now) from going into the subject because so many people either roll their eyes, or become paralyzed at the very idea.</p>  <p>After some soul searching, it’s clear that NOT telling you what I know about the subject is an act of gross malpractice as a Remote Viewing Teacher. So, I’m teaching you what I know, so you’ll know. </p>  <p>If you’ve had this nagging feeling, or dark cloud hanging over your head because you can feel that something about the future, just isn’t right. You already know it in your bones.</p>  <p><strong>In a nutshell, the “Killshot” is real. It’s coming. </strong>And, if you’re not prepared, the world and everything you know about it, is going to get really ugly. But, it doesn’t have to be all that terrible, if you know what to do and where to go, and if you can make it to the other side, some really amazing things will happen.</p>  <p><strong>In this course you’ll:</strong></p>  <ul><li><strong>Learn what he “Killshot” is all about</strong></li><li><strong>Where the few safe zones reside</strong></li><li><strong>Understand the reason for securing your sanctuary location</strong></li><li><strong>Discover the “Road to the Killshot” through a series of past/future events </strong></li><li><strong>Know what you need to secure yourself and your family</strong></li><li><strong>What to expect before/during/after the “Killshot” event.</strong></li></ul>            <p><em>While this subject does deal with a very dark topic, it’s not all doom and gloom. There is hope for those who make it out the other side</em>. We are evolving. For evolution to take place, nature makes room for the next phase to succeed and flourish. </p>  <p>We have the ability to do what the dinosaurs couldn’t, avoid extinction through evolution. </p>",
