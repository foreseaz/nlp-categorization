    "description": "<p>Ultimate Goal Setting and Achieving is the course for you if you have ever looked at someone else and thought <em>\"I want to be like them!\"</em></p><p>Sometimes when you try to be like that person, you might feel upset or even angry because despite all of your hard work it seems like you are getting nowhere, and everyone else is doing better than you.</p><p><em>That's because hard work alone is useless. You need direction and purpose. </em></p><p>Think of a car race. It doesn't matter how fast the car is, unless the driver knows how to point it in the right direction, someone else will win the race.</p><p><em>Imagine how different your life would be if you could just point your car in the right direction.</em></p><p>The good news is that you have the power to control your own car and win your own race by following a very specific process. </p><p><em>Ultimate Goal Setting and Achieving outlines that process.</em> </p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>How is the Course Structured?</strong><br></p><p>I have spent over 10 years studying the top 1% of all successful people in the world and working out how they achieve amazing things. I took everything I learned and combined it with my own experiences to create this course. </p><p>While most other courses take many hours to complete, I'm a very busy person and I don't have a lot of spare time to spend hours learning new techniques. I designed this course so that you learn all the skills you need very quickly, in an easy-to-follow format.<br></p><p>Inside you will find 13 high quality video lectures, under 5 different sections, each designed to guide you through the goal setting process step by step. It will take you 1 hour to watch the videos from start to finish, but but you will get more benefit if you complete each exercise first before moving onto the next lecture.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p><em>If you are frustrated with your current circumstances or annoyed that everyone else around you is doing better than you, then you should sign up for this course.</em><br></p><p>Everything I teach in here is exactly what I used to go from a very negative mental environment at home and at work, to being named Young Achiever of the Year in 2008. <br></p><p>It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from; or how much money you have or don't have. As long as you have a burning desire to be successful then this is the perfect course for you. </p><p><em>Sign up and start setting and achieving the right goals in your life so that people around you say \"Wow, I want to be like them!\"</em></p><p>See you inside!<br></p><p>- AJ~</p>",
