    "description": "<p>This course is intended for people who want to take control of their own financial lives; people who want to remove the self-imposed limits to financial freedom; people who understand they can make their own \"luck\" using their intuition.</p><p>Students should have a genuine desire to change their lives.  They understand this will involve effort and patience.  They accept that intuition is a skill that has to be honed like any other skill. They are open-minded and prepared to look at a new approach.</p><p>The course explains that \"luck\" is really intuition, a skill like any other.  Students are then shown how to enhance that particular skill using a series of exercises.  No complicated jargon is used.   Everything is explained in clear, ordinary English.  No additional materials are needed but students need to commit to spending some time each day to do the exercises.  </p><p>The course is in three parts:  What's Been Going Wrong?; How to Remove Limits; How to Know It's Working.  The course should not be rushed.  Students are developing a skill and that takes time.  But students should monitor their own progress during the course so that they can satisfy themselves that they are moving forward.  </p><p>By the end of the course, students should be more confident in their approach to finance and wealth.  They will understand that they have financial opportunities mall around them and they should now have the confidence within to respond to these opportunities. </p>",
