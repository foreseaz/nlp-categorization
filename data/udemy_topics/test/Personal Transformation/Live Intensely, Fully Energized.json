A new reality where nothing is unreachable, where all is possible and especially where there are no limits. Thank you  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">Macri Bastos.  Mother and Clinic Psychologist  Intercambios Culturales Bolivia</strong><strong style=\"\">:</strong>  I had the pleasure and the privilege Esther was my children´s private tutor/teacher. Both waited  anxiously to attend her classes and came back home happy after learning new things. Not only were my children recommended to her as students, also children from my friends.  One pays the hour in Gold, since her classes have no price, due to the experience children receive from developing the pleasure of learning and logics.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Astrid Denise Morgan – Lima - Perú :  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        I met Esther many years ago, when our children were studying at the Franco Boliviano &quot; Alcide D&#039;orbigny&quot; School. She struck me as a dynamic, positive, outgoing entrepreneur; in other words a modern woman with many interests and new, innovative ideas, who put them into practice very successfully. At the time, she produced spices and also tutored primary, middle school, high school, and University students in math, science, physics and chemistry. Whenever someone asked for a good tutor, the answer inevitably was:&quot; Call Esther Iberkleid, she&#039;s the best.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t     I was able to ascertain this a few years later, when my eldest child needed one. I obviously called Esther, and she proved to be all that was said about her and more. She helped my daughter to organize herself, acquire better study habits, enhanced her capabilities, learn the subject matter well, and as if that weren&#039;t enough, Esther gave her self esteem a great big boost. My daughter was able to clarify all her doubts and started looking at school with more confidence and self assurance, both gained during her tutoring.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        As a former teacher, I consider this to be a great asset in a tutor. I have seen many students who loose their confidence when they move into higher grades. It is not that they don&#039;t study, or don&#039;t know the subject matter; it is mainly that they loose faith in themselves due to various reasons. Subjects get tougher, they go into their teens and feel more vulnerable and are under the constant criticism of their peers, some even have teachers whom they fail to understand; or who undermine them. This causes children to lower their grades, and as they do so they start believing they aren&#039;t capable enough, which in turn makes them lower their grades even more. Esther is a teacher/tutor, who not only knows the subject she teaches well and is constantly learning more about it; but she is always improving herself in order to find additional ways to impart her lessons, making them interesting and effective. More importantly, she cares and helps students realize that they are capable of facing, and succeeding in any challenge they face.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        I admire Esther greatly. She has strength, is always positive, and will go out and do everything she needs to do, to reach her goal. It was only four years ago, that she told me about her new enterprise over a cup of coffee, and now the results are amazing! She is doing something she loves, is happy and is very successful at it. This is what we would all want to achieve in life, isn&#039;t it? ... and it is the reason why I feel that she is such a great role model.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        As a teacher, as a client, and as a parent I would highly recommend Esther. She is excellent at what she does, always seeking to be the best, and is always well informed on new trends, changes or improvements there are in her field. I am convinced that whatever Esther begins, or whichever goals she sets for herself, she will always reach them and be the best at what she does.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>  <h5 style=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11954849&amp;authToken=c5hy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">Wendy Howard</a> - Small Business Expert, helping Coaches, Trainers, Consultants to grow profitable businesses</h5>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Esther has the most amazing energy which she brings to all of her work and clients.
