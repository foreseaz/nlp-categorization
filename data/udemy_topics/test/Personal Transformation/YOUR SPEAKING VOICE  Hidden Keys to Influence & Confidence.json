If properly trained, your voice can become a powerful instrument to convey not just words, but the energy, the ideas, and the consciousness behind the words. A strong, resonant voice is confidence-building, commands attention, conveys trust and integrity, and establishes more easily a connection with your audience.</p><p><strong>Bad habits and age are stressful to the voice</strong>. Over the years, it tends to crack more often and to sound thinner, weaker, and more shallow. The organs that produce the voice are muscles, and like any other muscle, they need to be kept in good shape in order to work properly. <strong>This course will show you how.</strong></p><p><strong>Voice training can turn a weak, thin, cracking voice into a powerful communication tool</strong>. A misplaced voice inhibits, instead of enhancing, your ability to convey effectively content and ideas. Besides making it easier and more natural to use the voice, proper vocal training develops your sound and resonance, which translates into the ability to communicate on a deeper level.</p><p><strong>In this course you will learn the techniques to make your voice into a strong and reliable instrument to express your thoughts and feelings with clarity and conviction</strong>. The confidence that will come as a result, will make it easier for you to “get out of yourself” and connect with your audience on a deeper level. This synergy will help you feel that you and your audience are on the same side, taking away any sense of stress and building a subtle bridge between you and them.</p><p><strong>The course consists of</strong> video files with guided vocal exercises covering the main aspects and challenges of voice production. The videos will guide you through the practice of the exercises, giving you special instructions, reminders, and addressing the most common issues students often run into.<br></p><p>You will also have the opportunity to ask questions and get feedback by sending me a message on Udemy.</p><p><strong>Take action now!</strong> Every few minutes you’re delaying you’re not expressing your full potential as a speaker.<br></p><p><strong>TESTIMONIALS:</strong></p><p>“I am pretty new to teaching, so sometimes I find it difficult to handle a classroom full of students. More so on Thursdays, when I teach seven lessons almost back to back. I usually end each week with a hoarse and aching throat. Ramesha gave me an exercise to help me learn talking from my diaphragm and with resonance in my head, so that I would not strain my voice. When next I tried it I could hear my voice sound different; it was lower, and producing it was less effort. The first time was difficult for me to maintain, I had to consciously think about my belly moving and my throat position, and every time I raised my voice I lost it and had to start all over again, but it was worth it. Aside from the lack of strain, each time I spoke that way, I felt that my energy was more centered and I was in better control of it. The result was not only a better use of the voice, but also a more pleasant teaching experience.”  — O. L., Tel Aviv, Israel</p><p>\"Ramesha makes voice classes fun, interesting, and inspiring. He is a great example of what he teaches. His voice is so resonant and uplifting.\" --M. J., Seattle WA</p><p>\"Ramesha can impart vocal training in an interesting and fun way, and makes everyone feel they can apply the principles and make improvements.\" --K. D.
