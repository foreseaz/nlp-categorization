    "description": "<p>  \t                    This course is all about getting &quot;the ball&quot; rolling in your life again. We all hit a wall at some point in life, we run low on creative juices. This natural. What isn&#039;t so good, is to stay stagnated. It&#039;s supposed to be a season, not a permanent state.  </p>  <p>  \t                    However, I did find myself living in such a state for quite a long time. And it was really hard for me to start to understand how I could get out of it.  </p>  <p>  \t                    I&#039;ve been studying personal development, self-awareness and human behavior for over 6 years now. It has helped me tremendously!  </p>  <p>  \t                    I&#039;m not fearless, I&#039;m not a guru, or expert. But today I can honestly say that I know how to face, and overcome my challenges &amp; problems. I don&#039;t overreact, or react negatively, as I used to do all the time.  </p>  <p>  \t                    In this quick course I&#039;ll share some really easy, but important, ways that will help you to reignite that lost spark in your life.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Here are the <strong style=\"\">7 Quick Ways</strong>:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>01 - Yes, the time is right!</li>  \t<li>02 - Drop the B.S.!</li>  \t<li>03 - Consume good information (and put it to use).</li>  \t<li>04 - Consistency is key.</li>  \t<li>05 - Feel like giving up? (ignore the naysayers).</li>  \t<li>06 - Get out of your comfort zone.</li>  \t<li>07 - Make yourself accountable.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  Everything I share here is based on my own personal experience and point of view, it&#039;s what have worked for me. And I believe it could benefit others, such as yourself.  </p>  <p>  \t                    It&#039;s also important to notice that I&#039;m a non-native English speaker. So if you&#039;re not comfortable with my pronunciation (check the intro video), maybe it would be wise to avoid taking this course. ;-)  </p>  <p>  \t                    I&#039;m open to all kinds of constructive feedback. If you want to make a suggestion, please feel free to do so. If you enjoy the course, it would mean the world to me if you could leave me an honest rating and a review.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Thanks for taking the time to consider my course, I hope you enjoy it!  </p>  <p>  \t                    Take care, stay active, and stay positive!  </p>  <p>  \t                    Rod Gomes  </p>",
