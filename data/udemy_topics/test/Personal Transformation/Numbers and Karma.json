    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Using traditional astrology for predictions and some fortune telling has been the most common way of determining a person&#039;s life mission. This course aims to introduce a new understanding of what our true-life mission is through karmic numerology.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  As we have always known numbers since childhood, it is easier working with numbers than dealing with astrological symbols. What&#039;s more, Pythagoras a mathematician in the 6th century BC said, “Nothing could exit in the Universe without the numbers.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   As we are part of this Universe we are therefore part of the numbers and represent a “fragment of the power and divine knowledge&quot;.
