Thank you for your interest in taking my class. I hope you will take a moment to read this and join me in my course, ‘Awaken the Real You.’</p>\n\n<p>After losing 140 pounds and overcoming personal challenges, I have refined a process that will help you re-examine your life, identify the roadblocks to your goals, define what you want today and create a plan to live it!</p>\n\n<p>This course is designed for anyone who is feeling stuck and unfulfilled in their life. I am going to help you get UNSTUCK! I use common sense (backed by science) to help you find joy and fulfillment.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone processes and learns new information in different ways. There are three main cognitive learning styles: visual, auditory and kinesthetic. What does this mean? Some of us find it easier to learn by reading or with visuals, some would rather hear a lecture while others prefer doing hands-on activities. There is no right way, which is why I have tried to incorporate all three styles throughout the course to make it easy and fun to learn and embrace new concepts.</p>\n\n<p>As a family practice physician in Columbus, Ohio for the last 20 years, I have helped thousands of people (from all walks of life) champion their own health, healing and happiness and transform their lives and create the life they want… NOW IT’S YOUR TURN! <br></p>",
