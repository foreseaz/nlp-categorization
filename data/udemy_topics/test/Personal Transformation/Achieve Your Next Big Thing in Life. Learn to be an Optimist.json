    "description": "<p>Below I&#039;m going to share with you the <strong style=\"\">biggest idea from this course</strong>.</p><p>You can walk away with this idea and transform your life starting now or you can take the rest of the course and let me help you really dive in.</p><p>I read a book called Learned Optimism and in this post I&#039;m going to share with you <strong style=\"\">one very big idea from the book</strong> to help you <strong style=\"\">stay away from negativity so you can achieve your next big thing in life</strong>. </p><p>Answer this question:</p><p><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Are you pessimistic or optimistic?</strong></em></p><p>Think about that carefully. Before I read this book “Learned Optimism,&quot; I thought I was an optimist. I figured I would just learn a thing or two to help me become better.</p><p>When the author asked these questions, I said to myself:</p><p><em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">There&#039;s no way I am a pessimistic person</strong>. I mean, people like me. I&#039;m nice. I&#039;m achieving some of my goals. Can&#039;t be me.</em></p><p>But after I picked up this book and continued to read and take some of the tests developed by psychologist Martin Seligman.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Guess what??</strong></p><p><em style=\"\">I was wrong. Totally wrong!</em></p><p>It turned out that I actually had pessimistic tendencies which was preventing me from achieving my other goals.</p><p>Obviously this bothered me because Seligman says that there&#039;s evidence that <strong style=\"\">people who are pessimistic are more prone to depression and more prone to negative consequences</strong><span></span>.</p><p>So as you can see, I was not only flabbergasted, but I wanted to learn, very fast, how I could escape any possibilities of a mental prison of negativity.</p><p>I wanted to be more optimistic in life and positive! But not in that phony way. In the way that made sense and was a little realistic.</p><p>Not only because <strong style=\"\">success is tied to optimism</strong>, but also because pessimism is tied to depression and anxiety. I want to be better in life and more successful, I mean who doesn&#039;t, but I really want to avoid depression and anxiety. Don&#039;t you?</p><p>Before I invite you to join me in this course I made for you that will dive into the big ideas from this book about how to <strong style=\"\">become more optimistic so you can achieve your next big thing in life</strong> (and help protect yourself from mental and physical illnesses), how about I share with you one of the biggest ideas in this book.</p><p>Here&#039;s the big idea that can save your life.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Human beings can become helpless.</strong></p><p>Not just people from certain countries who are imprisoned or starving, but people who are living decent lives.</p><p>Now wait, let me explain, because <strong style=\"\">this IS SERIOUS</strong>!</p><p>What Martin Seligman is saying (based on experiments and research) is that<strong style=\"\">:</strong></p><p><strong style=\"\">You can become helpless in your mind without even knowing it</strong>.</p><p>Here&#039;s an example.</p><p>You feel sick, and your friend, or spouse tells you to go to the doctor.</p><p>And you say,</p><p><em style=\"\">“I know I should, but he&#039;s probably not going to do anything. So it doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;</em></p><p>Here&#039;s another example,</p><p><em style=\"\">You know you should stay away from eating too much cake, but you think I&#039;ll never really get in shape so who cares if I have a little cake. It won&#039;t matter anyway.</em></p><p>Another example, you lost your job and you&#039;ve been out of work for 3 months. You hear about this job opportunity that is something you really want.</p><p>Everyone tells you to apply, but you start to think:</p><p><em style=\"\">“Well, I know I should, but it doesn&#039;t matter because what are the odds that I&#039;ll get the job. There&#039;s no point.&quot;</em></p><p>You see a person you really want to meet and you want to approach them, but you&#039;re thinking <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">she&#039;s not going to be interested so forget it.</em></strong></p><p>Now listen, even if you think: <em style=\"\">I don&#039;t do any of this, I&#039;m really optimistic, I only see the bright things in life</em>, trust me this gets more deep. We&#039;re just skimming the surface here.</p><p>You see, <strong style=\"\">Seligman has proven that you can become helpless in the mind</strong> depending on how you view different circumstances and events in your life.</p><p>The thing that&#039;s really intriguing about all this is that sometimes you may not even know this negativity is happening to you. It can happen subconsciously due to things that happened to you in life and even the way people have treated you in the past.</p><p>And this is not the only indicator that you may have a aspects of a helpless mindset that&#039;s not letting you live to your potential. There&#039;s more intricacies to this.</p><p><strong style=\"\">This form of helplessness will prevent you from achieving the big things in life</strong>. It will also not grant you happiness. It perpetuates sadness, and stagnation.</p><p>Let me help you more by sharing some of the other big ideas in this book so you can <strong style=\"\">transform pessimism into optimism and achieve your next big thing in life.</strong></p><p>Want to learn more about how to do this, turning any underlying pessimism into optimism?
