    "description": "<p>  \t  <em>This course gives a presentation on the top 10 Principles which can lead you to a conscious, consistent and enduring sense of peace and joy as you go about your everyday life.</em></p><p><em></em><strong>This is NOT a religious course pushing my doctrinal positions, but a very practical course involving 11 very short lectures followed by some practical activities to test out for yourself.</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The Principles are Biblically-based, in that they can all find support in the Bible, but this course is all about what you do day to day, NOT what you may or may not believe about God, the World, Salvation, etc. But it also has very solid support from Neurological Research - I strongly recommend the work of Dr Jeffrey M Schwartz (see for example his great book 'The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force'). </p><p><strong>Give it a try - you have nothing to lose and possibly much to gain!  </strong></p>  <p>  \t  After a presentation on each principle some simple tasks are suggested to help exercise the principle and with repeated practice over a short period of time these tasks can become part of your daily routine.  </p>  <p>  \t  Each Principle is presented in 5-10 minute segments with the whole course taking around 1 hour.   \t  \tWhile you may want to go through the whole course in one sitting, it is recommended that you address each Principle one at a time and spend a week working on the related tasks. With this recommended approach the course will take some 10 Weeks to complete.  </p>  <p>  \t  <strong>By working through this course and doing the follow-up exercises you can expect to see your general sense of well-being and happiness improve in some tangible way. </strong>If not then get a refund!</p>  <p>  \t  By appreciating the underlying concepts and  learning the pro-active tasks that create new neural pathways to solidify the skills/thinking involved you will be able to make permanent and positive changes to your world.  </p>",
