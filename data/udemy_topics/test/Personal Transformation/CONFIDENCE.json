We were so poor we would go to KFC to lick other people’s fingers. We were so poor we didn’t ride the greyhound bus we rode the greyhound. :) I grew up with a lot of limiting beliefs about who I was and what I am capable of accomplishing. I had the belief that God wanted me to be poor. I had the belief that I was not good enough I did not deserve it. I struggled with my weight at the time I was 30 pounds overweight. I struggled with the relationships that I had in my life. I was held back and constantly put down by others. This was my reality. Then I had a mentor come into my life. My mentor gave me a new belief system a new way of seeing myself that totally and radically changed the way I saw myself and the world around me. Today I am living the life of my dreams!
