Combining elements of storytelling and occasional comedic value, each video has a rather episodic feel -- not necessarily depending on each other, but rather complimenting each other.<br style=\"\"></p>  <p>  \t  Along the way, you'll be greeted with lots of beautiful scenery that will leave your mind in awe.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>What you'll get:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Carefully crafted, high production value content</li>  \t<li>A flood of deep thoughts showing you how to think differently</li>  \t<li>Tons of visual stimulation to help keep you engaged</li>  \t<li>A better perception of the world around you.</li></ul><p><em>(Additional lectures are currently in the creation process.)</em></p>  <p>  \t  You can continue living your life day-to-day like you currently do, and nothing will change.  </p>  <p>  \t  If you want to experience the world from a different perspective, you're invited to take this journey across cities &amp; mountains to explore your mind.  </p><p>All you have to do is <strong>take the red pill</strong> by signing up for this course.
