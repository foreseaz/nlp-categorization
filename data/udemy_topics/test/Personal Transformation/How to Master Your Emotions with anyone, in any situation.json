To feel confident, excited and energised rather than sad, anxious or angry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public speaking is rated as one of the most common fears in the world, more common even than the fear of death.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Well imagine if you could stand up and do a speech in front of a thousand people feeling rock solid calm and confident…because you could choose to? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>Emotions are the most powerful force in human psychology, they drive everything we do, they influence every decision, affect every performance, determine what we will do and not do, say and not say, how we will do and say those things, how we live our lives, how we excel or how we hold ourselves back. Your emotions are at the heart of everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact the very quality of your life is determined by the quality of the emotional states you experience. Happiness isn't about what you have; it's about how you feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, less than 10% of the world actually bothers to learn how to master their emotions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if I told you there is no secret to it, you don't need to be a psychologist to run your own emotional state, in fact – you're already running it – you probably just don't know how. Nobody taught you, until now...</p>\n\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you take this course, you will learn how your emotions work, how to run them and three simple very powerful techniques that you can use on yourself and even help others to permanently change the way you feel around different people, situations and events. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong>No skills required - notice results immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Partner at The Coaching Room - one of the leading personal development organisations in the world, I've personally used the three techniques in this course on my clients from CEOs to mums and dads and have received breakthrough feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you</strong><strong>'re ready to experience emotional freedom then I encourage you to enrol right </strong><strong>now. </strong><strong>Click the \"Take This Course\" button in the top right hand corner.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will take 30 seconds to enrol, and then you can start learning how to master your emotions immediately.</p>",
