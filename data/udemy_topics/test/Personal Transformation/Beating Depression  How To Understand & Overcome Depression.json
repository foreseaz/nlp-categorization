    "description": "<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common &amp; also harder to bear. When people conceal mental pain, this often increases the burden: it's far easier to say 'My head is sore' than what it is to say 'My heart is broken!'</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you're depressed, you may feel that nothing can help. But this is untrue. Most people recover from depression, and some even look back at it as a useful experience which forced them to evaluate their life and make changes in their thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>‘Beating Depression: Understand &amp; Overcome Depression’ is an engaging online depression course for anyone who's ready to begin making changes today. The course offers crucial insights for understanding what depression is, where it comes from &amp; how you can overcome it without any help from therapists, doctors or even prescribed medication.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">By the end of this course, you will understand:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What Depression is and Where it Comes From.</li><li>How to Develop &amp; Nurture a Strong Inner Resilience.</li>\n<li>How to Manage Depression Alongside Other Negative Emotions.</li>\n<li>How to Identify &amp; Change Your Habitual Response Patterns.</li>\n<li>The First Steps to Take Towards Overcoming Depression For Good!</li>\n<li>How to Develop Genuine Confidence That's Easily Recognised by Others.</li>\n<li>How to Manage Negative 'Head Talk’ &amp; Harness Tools to Cultivate Your Inner Peace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to know that there are no instant solutions to our main problems in life. Solving problems involve time, energy and effort. If you are feeling depressed, deciding to do something to help yourself is the most important first step you can take.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Negative emotions are something that we don't always get taught about in school. In life, when people don't learn how to understand and manage their emotions, they stand at risk of having their emotions manage them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the primary aim of this course is to provide you with practical, easy-to-understand information for developing your emotional awareness, so you can take control of depression and begin moving forward with the rest of your life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">‘Depression Boot Camp’ comes with a Full Money Back Guarantee, and if you're less than fully satisfied, you can get a full refund within 30 days of purchase.</strong></em></p>",
