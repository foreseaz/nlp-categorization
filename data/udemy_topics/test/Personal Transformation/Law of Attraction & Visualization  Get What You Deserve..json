    "description": "<p><strong>The secret behind \"The Secret\". Have you tried \"visualization\" before but \"didn't work\"? Find out the truth behind the laws of visualization explained like never before.<br></strong></p><p><strong>Creative Visualization</strong> is the process whereby you can create results in your tangible life that previously had eluded you. CV can be used to improve health - physical, mental, emotional, social, financial, professional, marital and spiritual. For that reason we have come to refer to creative visualization as focused intention therapy, the sort of therapy that you can do by yourself on yourself. </p><p>There is a strong body of scientific research on the topics presented here. However, this course is not a review of the scientific literature; rather, this course is more like a \"how-to manual\" for those who feel ready to jump right in and change theirs lives for he better. </p><p>Here you will learn how to master the law of attraction, make visualization part of your daily routine, understand \"what\" to visualize and \"how\", and create your own future. Use the power of focused intention to achieve impressive results. Use creative visualization to help make the world a better place.</p><p>The course is very well explained by an experienced professor, however it uses a peculiar pedagogical style. What you see in the Promotional video is you get throughout the course: no animations, no graphics, no bullet points. The teaching style evolved from years of experience as hypnotherapist; it works really well when your attention is fully engaged because you come to visualize as you learn. In this sense, you learn by doing it. Therefore, from this perspective, visual aids that can be useful in other types of courses would function as a distraction here. For that same reason we also discourage listening to the course in audio-only fashion while doing something else, such as driving a car. Feel free to submit questions or comments about this or any other matter.   </p>",
