    "description": "<p>Buddhism is the oldest and most successful Self-Help program on Earth. There is debate over whether Buddhism is a religion or a philosophy. When asked to weigh in on this question my answer is always definitely yes! There is no Divine figure to worship, no cosmogony and no dogma in Buddhism. In that respect it does not appear to be a religion. But if you consider a religion to be a set of ideas around which you live your life and that in turn brings you to peace and a deep understanding of the True Nature of life, then Buddhism is most definitely a religion. This incredibly practical and adaptive tradition is something that everyone should learn about. I designed this course especially for Westerners who have had little or no contact with Buddhism other than the few words and ideas that have filtered through to the West. It is presented in a very entertaining and light fashion including stories and humor. The simplicity of the course however should not fool you into thinking the content is in any way compromised. Experienced Buddhists would also do well to take this course so as to understand in clear and easy to grasp interpretations of what Buddhism is really all about. I have had lifelong Buddhists take the class and remark to me that this was the first time they truly understood their own religion. So whether new to the subject or very experienced you will find knowledge of great value to you and your life in this course. In the end, you will understand why it is that you have been living less than you are deserving of and how to regain your Natural state of Joy, Compassion, Love and Freedom.</p>",
