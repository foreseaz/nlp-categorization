    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>Without the option of spending hours daily in guided meditation or scooting off to week-long Zen retreats, you&#039;ve got to make energetic health fit into everyday life!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                     As a professional Tarot reader, I love what I do, but was finding myself drained and run down after intense sessions. Looking to take better care of myself, I was nudged from the Universe to investigate Chakras as a framework for managing the considerable energetic demands of my work.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Staying laser-focused on practical, accessible, and simple options that donâ€™t require much fuss, I was shocked how much impact these very simple techniques had in a very short time</strong>. I found myself not merely &quot;less drained,&quot; but enjoying significant improvement in physical complaints, with clearer thinking and better focus to boot. Although Chakra work does not replace traditional medical support, it does provide a perfect (and effective) compliment to more traditional therapies without risk.  </p>  <p>  \t      Everybody has non-negotiable demands on time, attention and energy. <strong>So often, vital self-care gets relegated to &quot;someday&quot; that never seems to come.</strong> We can all use simple, practical ways to stay at our best. Chakra work addresses this need elegantly.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>Whether we&#039;re facing extraordinary challenges or whether we just want to be as happy and successful as possible, <strong>Chakra work provides easy, accessible and rewarding options to &quot;center&quot; in the midst of busy life. </strong>That&#039;s why I decided to share the research I did for myself with others; I knew firsthand how much it could help.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>     This course walks you through each of the Chakras and how they work, individually and within the system.</strong> We&#039;ll discover how to identify centers that are out of balance and more importantly, simple approaches to bring your energy back into alignment.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>          You&#039;ll learn my &quot;Meditation in a Minute&quot; technique to immediately shore up functioning in any area of your life.</strong> You&#039;ll be armed with information on food, essential oils, gemstones and everyday activities that can help you stay healthy, focused and in balance.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Sections cover getting oriented to the Chakra system, the lower Chakras, the upper Chakras, quizzes and review checkpoints</strong> to make sure you are fully prepared to put into practice what you&#039;ve learned.  </p>  <p>  \t              I will be available to answer questions and offer support. Even if you&#039;re not ready to enroll in this course, I do hope you make some space for Chakra work in your life. I was blessed with great results from my own Chakra work and hope to inspire others to embark on experiments for themselves. Thanks for coming along on the journey with me.  </p>",
