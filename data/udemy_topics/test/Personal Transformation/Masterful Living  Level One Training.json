    "description": "<p><strong>COURSE PREMISE</strong></p><p>Humanity has entered into a period of massive change and restructuring. At the same time, each individual is undergoing a similar <em>wholesale reconfiguration</em> on a personal level.</p><p>It is a completely new paradigm of life on planet Earth that is emerging, as the old paradigm is being left behind.</p><p>The old paradigm is a <em>rigid/limiting configuration</em> that effectively disabled the unlimited potential of humans.</p><p>The new paradigm is an <em>expansionary/open configuration</em> that supports a living reality of infinite possibility, empowerment and opportunity for all humans.</p><p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p><p><strong><em>The structuring, the beliefs, and the agreements of the old paradigm are deeply engrained in the consciousness of humanity at this time, which makes it extremely difficult to learn/apply the concepts and considerations of the new paradigm.</em></strong></p><p>The longer it takes humanity and individuals to make the transition, the more struggle, disparity and drama humans will continue to manifest/experience.</p><p><strong>THE WAY FORWARD</strong></p><p>Each individual must make a conscious decision to let go of the obsolete old paradigm and adopt the new, 'upgraded platform' of the emerging paradigm for themselves.</p><p><em><strong>In order to do that, you will need to begin by making a conscious effort to remove or 'uninstall' all aspects/components of the old paradigm from your reality, so that they can be replaced or 'overwritten' with concepts and patterns that are in alignment with the new paradigm.</strong></em></p><p>That is what this Level One Training course is designed to enable you to do.</p><p><strong>CONTENTS AND OVERVIEW</strong></p><p>In this course we use a variety of media and examples to present/examine:</p><ul><li>how the shift has been unfolding over the past two hundred years.</li><li>how this shift has been accelerating as we moved through the 2012 centre-point and beyond.</li><li>key factors of the old paradigm that cloud/distort perception-fundamental universal intentions designed to facilitate your individual shift.</li><li>common unconscious patterns of the normal human being that significantly undermine creative potential.</li><li>what you can expect to experience in your own <em>personal</em> shift.</li><li>what you can expect to observe in the world around you over the coming decades.</li></ul><p>In addition, you are provided with some simple but powerful tools and exercises that are designed to accelerate the removal of old beliefs/habits and destructive patterns.</p><p><strong><em>NB: This course is intended to be discussion-oriented. The more you ask questions and participate, the more you will get out of this course.</em></strong></p><p>Your feedback is always welcomed and encouraged.</p><p>If there is any further information or clarification that you require about anything, do not hesitate to ask.</p><p><strong>AND FINALLY, be sure to watch for announcements and new course materials/resources that are added periodically.</strong></p>",
