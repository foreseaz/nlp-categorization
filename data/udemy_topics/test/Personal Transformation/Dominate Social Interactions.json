    "description": "<p>Humans beings are emotional creatures. Ninety Percent of the decisions we make are based on emotions. We act on our emotions and then use logic to justify our actions. Often, you will find yourself involved in difficult conversations or arguments. The key is to mentally dominate the other person. This course will share some of the basic techniques you can use to get the upper hand in any situation. You will dictate the flow of the conversation and you will be able to determine the outcome as well.</p><p>In order to dominate social interactions, you must be confident. You must be assertive and use the right words. In addition, you must make sure you are careful how you pronounce the words. Inflection, tone, rhythm, and numerous other factors influence the decision making process. With mastery of words, body language, and the art of social interaction, you can easily make friends, business partners, and be on excellent terms with your immediate family and relatives.</p><p>As humans, we are social beings. We cannot live in isolation. It is imperative that we interact with other human beings. Therefore, we must master the social interaction process so that we can get the most from the effort that we put in. Usually, people have inhibitions, reservations, and fears. Fear is a useless emotion. Clearly, it accomplishes nothing. In fact, it stops us from achieving or doing just about anything.</p><p>This short course gives you a glimpse into what it is like to interact in a socially competent manner. With social competence, we can gain advantage in just about an real life situation. It is a well known fact now that 85 percent of success is determined by a person&#039;s people skills and only fifteen percent is determined by their technical skills.</p><p>With this said, we must concentrate on improving our social skills. In business, people hesitate and overthink too much. This stops them from excelling in any of their endeavors. It puts limitations on what they can achieve. They never realize their true potential. These people are headstrong, stubborn, and egoistic. These people will never learn how to be successful.</p>",
