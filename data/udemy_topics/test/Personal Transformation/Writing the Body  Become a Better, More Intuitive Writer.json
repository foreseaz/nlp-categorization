These are found starting in Section 7.  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<br>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>The course includes  </p>  <ul>  \t<strong>  \t<li><strong>4.5 minute introductory video</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>14 audio meditations<br>  \t</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>62 pages of materials</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>27 writing exercises </strong></li>  \t<li><strong><strong>14 body exercises</strong></strong></li>  \t<li><strong><strong>Quiz</strong></strong></li>  \t</strong>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong><strong></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><strong><em>Design of course materials by Pam Lostracco, artist, designer, muralist. </em></strong></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><strong><em>Many thanks to Anita Neufeld for her video and editing  expertise, and to Christine Gibson of Code N Graphics for her  participation as \"student\" in the film.</em></strong></strong>  </p>        \t  \t\t<br>  \t        <br>",
