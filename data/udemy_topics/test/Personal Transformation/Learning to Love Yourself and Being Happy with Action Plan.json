    "description": "<p>Now, this may sound dark, but don't let it get you down. I'm here to bring you good news. Great news in fact. If you want to be happy, you've come to the right place! I've spent years, pondering the question of why some people are happy despite being in what may seem like bad conditions to most of us looking in from the outside, and why other people who seem to have every advantage in life still are rarely smiling at all. When you take the time to study really how these two sets of people approach life the answer to the \"happiness question\" becomes pretty clear. </p><p>We can choose to become the masters of our emotions, you can make smart lifestyle and social choices that will almost ensure that you find ourselves happy at the end of the day. No matter what you face. Or you can do the exact opposite. My guess is if you find yourself taking this course you're the type of person who's just like me: </p><ul><li>Interested in doing what you can to get the most out of life. </li><li>To maximize your potential and your enjoyment every day. </li><li>To crack the happiness code! </li></ul><p>That's what the purpose of this course is. I can't wait to share with you what I've learned about this exciting subject. I can almost guarantee if you take the time to take this course and to work with the ideas and methods I'm about to provide you with, your entire outlook on life will change for the better. We're not talking small change either. We're talking about a huge, revolutionary change.</p>",
