Table manners have a long history, and were established as a way of keeping the peace and domesticating our behaviour. These rituals were handed down from generation to generation, eventually becoming tradition. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with our hectic lifestyles, many of us multitask and eat on the run. Although many dining traditions may not seem crucial while eating in front of the TV or computer, our table conduct is still considered important during social, business and formal occasions. Unfortunately, when we’re unsure how to skillfully navigate a meal, the dining experience can become an awkward encounter. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>How you eat and how you behave while dining can leave a lasting impression of you in the minds of those seated with you at the dining table, and those dining around you. Through studying this course and practicing the skills, the everyday dining experience can be an enjoyable one.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content and Overview</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>'Everyday Dining Etiquette' is designed for personal and professional development based on corporate seminars Kimberly Law has been presenting since 1999. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed to be easily understood by beginners, and offer a great refresher for those who need one.
