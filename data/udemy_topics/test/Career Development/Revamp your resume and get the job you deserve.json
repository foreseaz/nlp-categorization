He was nearly homeless because he struggled for many months to get a job in the music industry. Why? His old resume lacked relevant content, needed serious work and a complete revamp. He had his eye on the biggest music agency in the world, and with our expert <strong>resume help</strong>, he got the JOB!  </p>  <p>  \t    In this new economy, things have completely changed. Having the right experience is no longer enough to get a job. Competition is fierce and for resumes, Content is King! You need to stand out from the crowd and market yourself in a way that when an employer sees your resume, they have to call you for an interview immediately.  </p>  <p>  \t    The old way where you simply write a boring objective and list your qualifications simply doesn’t work anymore. Gimmicks and trying to beat the Application Tracking Systems don’t work either. It is all about showing how you can add value to an employer. What can you do for them (not just you?)  </p>  <p>  \t    As current employers ourselves, we have put all of our knowledge into this course to teach you all the tactics we know from both sides of the resume game.  </p>",
