    "description": "<p><strong>See exactly how I`ve landed 107 job interviews during my career WITHOUT one rejection, application, resume or being salesy!</strong></p><p>I hit the 'wall' after being rejected 100% of the time over a <strong>depressing</strong> 7 month job-hunt. I had applied for dozens of jobs on online job boards, company websites, and at job fairs. They were all <strong>dead-ends</strong>. </p><p>At my lowest point I discovered this <strong>little-known technique</strong> that changed my life and my career. The method was easy to use. It landed me a  <strong>100% acceptance rate</strong> for interviews. \n</p><p>In the first week of using this method I <strong>landed 7 C-level meetings!</strong>\n</p><p>How would it feel if you could consistently land interviews <strong>without wasting time</strong> on resumes, applications, and searching for jobs online? \n</p><p>After mastering this method, I`ve taught it to thousands of students from <strong>around the world.</strong>\n</p><p>I know this method works for others as well. Check out the free preview with the <strong>success stories</strong> of my students. \n</p><p>Everything is shared - I reveal all I know and use…as I test and gather more feedback, those additions that are successful are added to the course - at no extra cost to you! This is a course that will continue to grow and grow. \n</p><p>In addition to the Udemy 30-day guarantee, you have my personal promise that you will be wowed and delighted by what you`ll learn in the next two hours….and <strong>you’ll be kicking yourself for not having started your job search this way. </strong>\n</p><p>What this course is not: \n</p><p>I will not provide coaching on an individual basis. I don`t know your competence or target industry. It would be reckless of me to advise you. Your commitment and focus are the biggest drivers of results using this approach. \n</p><p>If you the want the ‘insider’s method’ to getting interviews - <strong>remember I`ve never been rejected asking for an interview using this approach</strong> - then you need to get this course now…right this minute. \n</p><p><strong>Every minute you delay, is keeping you from your next job...</strong></p><p>Enroll now! </p>",
