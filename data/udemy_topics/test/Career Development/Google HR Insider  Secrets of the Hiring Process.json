Ghan Patel reveals how companies are doing this and how you can use technology to your advantage.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Fusing 21<sup style=\"\">st</sup> century insights and timeless best practices, this course transforms job-hunting from a waiting game to an organized and action driven process that makes you stand out to companies and recruiters as the best possible candidate.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  From Course Instructor Ghan Patel: Working at Google for over 5 years in the Human Resources department during their high growth period taught me a tremendous amount about what tactics worked regarding people&#039;s resumes and Interviewing skills.  Also during this time, many friends and family members asked for help in their own job searches and I began to see many recurring mistakes that were making this much harder for them.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I decided to leave Google to start my own Job search education company because I wanted to be on the other side-- that is, I wanted to help people get hired for great jobs, not only selecting the few that already had good resumes, connections, and interviewing skills.   I developed a system that focuses attention in three areas:<strong style=\"\"> Job Search, Resume, Interview</strong>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  After the <strong style=\"\">Job Search</strong> <strong style=\"\">section</strong>, you’ll have concrete tools that will focus your time on the behaviors that will get you to a job the fastest.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  With the<strong style=\"\"> Resume</strong> <strong style=\"\">section</strong>, we’ll use insider expertise to create compelling application materials that will stand out from the crowd. (This includes best use practices of LinkedIn)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  After the <strong style=\"\">Interview section</strong>, you’ll know what to expect and be prepared to parry the most difficult questions and circumstances.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI hope you find this tremendously valuable and you land your dream job very soon.  </p>",
