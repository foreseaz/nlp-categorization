    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t          Job aids are trainer&#039;s, instructional designer&#039;s, and teacher&#039;s best friends! They can improve retention, they ensure success, and they save training or teaching course length. This course will teach you how to choose the type of job aid you need for your organization and how Microsoft Word can be used to design a job aid that will increase performance. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          My name is Raul Esparza and I create interactive learning experiences for instructor led and online training. Job aids are an additional tool you use on a weekly basis to enhance performance and save resources for the organization you work for, just like I do. Cutting learning time and development time is good for your organization, your learners, and you. Itâ€™s a win, win for everyone! <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          Did you know there are instances where a job aid can actually replace a training course? Instead of pulling people from their job for an hour we can design a job aid they can learn to use in a matter of minutes. Usually we design job aids to enhance training and cut down on the training time. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          Once you complete this course you will be able to develop effective job aids and you will save time while creating job aids using all the Microsoft Word features. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          A job aid can be a step by step guide for performing a task on the job or just a checklist, they are also known as performance support tools and can take many forms such as worksheets, tables, and flow charts. Microsoft Word has many features that can make designing a job aid easy. You will see three types of job aids being created using Word 2007 with SnagIt, and 2010, 2013 using the ScreenShot function. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          I have also included two bonus lessons for you Articulate Storyline Users! You will see how Storyline can be used to create job aids quickly then exported for further editing!  </p>",
