    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>Overview</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The <strong><em>FastMath</em></strong> <strong>Case Interview Preparation</strong> online course is specifically designed to teach the quantitative skills needed to succeed in management consulting interviews. This is an on-demand video (and audio) based course that you can go through at your own pace, and includes practice problems which reinforce the skills taught in the course. The <b><i>FastMath</i></b> <b>Case Interview Preparation</b> online course is different from other quant interview-prep resources because it uses video based instruction to teach you how to do calculations quickly and efficiently without a calculator (as required in case interviews), instead of simply providing drill problems and answers.</p><p>The <b><i>FastMath</i></b> course is the recommended quant training for consulting clubs at Wharton, Columbia Business School, London Business School and numerous other MBA programs. Over 3,000 candidates have used the <b><i>FastMath</i></b> course to prepare for consulting interviews. The author is a former McKinsey Consultant and a graduate of Harvard and MIT.</p><p><strong>Course Features</strong></p><ul><li>35+ Lessons/Modules</li><li>7+ hours of on-demand video lessons</li><li>Mental math techniques</li><li>Real quant case interview problems &amp; solutions</li><li>Comprehensive practice problems</li><li> Downloadable tables &amp; reference files</li><li> iPad, iPhone &amp; Android mobile applications</li><li>Quant techniques helpful for the McKinsey PST (e.g. compound growth calculations)</li></ul><p><strong>Course Details</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The <i><strong>FastMath</strong></i> <strong>Case Interview Preparation</strong> online course teaches the quant skills needed to succeed in management consulting case interviews. The <i><strong>FastMath</strong></i> <strong>Case Interview Preparation</strong> course has two components. The first half of the course teaches techniques to perform numerical calculations quickly and efficiently without using a calculator - as required in case interviews. The second half of the course covers the most common types of quantitative problems given in case interviews. </p><p>The course shows students the most efficient solution method for each problem type, and how to use the techniques taught in the first portion of the course to calculate answers quickly and efficiently. Course lessons highlight how to use the quantitative results to develop case insights and recommendations. All the quantitative problems are based on actual case interviews from leading management consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Accenture and Deloitte.</p><p><strong>Mental-Math Techniques</strong></p><p>Learn techniques to improve speed and efficiency for the following types of calculations: </p><ul><li>Multiplication &amp; division</li><li>Percentage calculations</li><li>Fractions &amp; decimal calculations</li><li>Compound growth calculations</li><li>NPV Calculations</li></ul><span></span>  <p><strong> Quant Problems Types</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong></strong>The course provides examples and solution methods for the most common types of quantitative problems given in case interviews, including:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Market sizing and estimation analysis</li>  \t<li>Chart reading</li>  \t<li>Break-even analysis</li>  \t<li>Economies of scale</li>  \t<li>Price elasticity and optimization</li>  \t<li>Growth rate analysis</li><li>Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis</li></ul><ul>  </ul>  <p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p><p><b>“</b>Excellent material!
