    "description": "<p>Update Feb 2016 - Thank you to all those who have been engaging with the course material!<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have been practicing and the networking skills in this course myself and as a result I have been headhunted via LinkedIn for a challenging new role in data science which starts this week. </p><p>The strategies do work so keep persevering! I am always available and keen to help you out so feel free to get in touch if you require more guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                          **</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Update: March 2015 - I was interviewed by national newspaper The Age and my story appeared on a full page article (I am unable to share links as per Udemy policy but the story can be found by Googling): </p>\n\n<p>The Age - The Rise Of Soft Skills: Why Top Marks No Longer Get The Best Jobs<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>**<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Technical skills, good grades and even a keen intellect are necessary but may not be sufficient to get you to where you want to go.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                  Research estimates that up to <strong>80% of jobs are found through networking</strong>. The value of networking in the job search cannot be understated. Trying to land a job by conventional methods such as online job boards or structured recruitment programs can be extremely difficult - one recruiter shared that for a recent graduate engineering program, there were <em>1,600 applicants for just 30 jobs</em>.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<u>But</u> networking can be daunting, especially if you are an introvert. Traditional networking events seem to best suit people who are loud or outgoing. And if you are an introvert (like me), that is probably not you.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>There is a better way. </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<u>Introversion can actually be an advantage in networking</u>, and this course is designed teach you how. Inspired by Susan Cain's TED Talk \"The Power of Introverts\", this course is taught by, and specially tailored for introverts who understand the importance of networking but find it hard to excel in conventional networking events.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                  This course is both comprehensive and practical, and includes sample invitation templates, meeting preparation notes and tested questions that you can use straight away. And because there is nothing like a live demonstration, I have simulated an actual networking meeting so you can see the learning points in action.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Here is what a recent student said after putting this course into practice:</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>\"It went really well! Got to learn a lot about the methods and responsibilities about change management and ways to get into the industry. The networking method you taught me is magic!\" </strong><strong>- Anna Lim </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>This course is risk free</strong>. It comes with a 30-day, no questions asked, money-back guarantee. So if you are not satisfied, you will get all your money back.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                        So <strong>enrol today</strong> by clicking the <strong>\"Take This Course\"</strong> button at the top-right of this page to be on your way to your first successful networking meeting today.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                  And remember, it's not what you know, it's who you know... and who knows you!\"  </p>",
