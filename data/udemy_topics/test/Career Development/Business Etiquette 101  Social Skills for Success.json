Since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, jobs have become scarce and you have to go one extra mile to stay on your career trajectory. How do you remain employable? How do you stand out from the crowd? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Despite what you might think, learning more technical skill is often not the answer. Instead, improving, enhancing and developing your social skill is the key to sustained employment and professional success.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For two people who have a comparable level of education and skill, what separates these two people when it comes to success is their ability to connect with others, engage in conversation, and communicate their true potential to decision-makers in their industry. In other words, what separates these two people when it comes to success, is their level of social skill in business. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you learn business etiquette and social skills?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Business etiquette and social skills can be hard to acquire. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>First, you cannot rely on formal education because universities and business schools fail to include this type of training in their curriculum. Or if they do, it’s at a very superficial level. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Second, it’s expensive because traditionally, business etiquette training has been reserved for the elite. A six-week program in basic business etiquette can easily cost you thousands of dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As an international business etiquette and social skills expert who has worked with clients all around the world, my aim with this course is to make business etiquette training affordable and accessible for all. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell me more about this course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Business Etiquette 101: Social Skills for Professional Success is a focused, fun and engaging video course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn intelligent insights into human behavior, and actionable strategies that will help you build a stronger professional brand, connect better with colleagues and clients, and give you the confidence to excel in business. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is over 3.5 hours of video content, a custom designed workbook, presentation slides, and quizzes to deepen your learning.
