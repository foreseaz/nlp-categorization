We have presented this material many times to students wishing to improve their interview skills and we are excited about this platform, so even more students can benefit. This course is created with all types of students in mind, from the high school student who has never walked into an interview to the professional who struggles with nervousness. We have gleaned information and wisdom from years of experience in helping clients deal with those issues. The material is presented in a language that everyone can easily understand. We have included downloads that will help with preparation and remembering the information covered. This course is set up in 9 different, easily followed, sections and should take a little over 30 minutes to complete. This course will help one with knowing how to successfully navigate the interview process. </p>",
