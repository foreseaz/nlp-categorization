This course will also provide you with an assessment form that will allow you to see your level of readiness to take an online course or degree program. There are links to tutorials, articles, books, assessments and various other supporting media in this course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\t The course should take 10 weeks to complete. However, this may be shorter or longer depending on your schedule and academic abilities. This course was structured to engage you using Hortonâ€™s (2012) process of engagement and learning. The absorb-type, do-type, connect-type, and assessments, help to create a flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\t You will first absorb information by watching a video lecture, listening to an audio lecture, and reading media. Then you will do an activity like searching Google Scholar for articles, writing papers, creating spreadsheets, creating presentations and discussing your views with cohorts (other students / learners). During your discussion process you are forced to use critical thinking to connect information that you have learned to your academic pursuits, your work, and other real-life scenarios. The final part of the flow is to check to see if you have learned by taking a quiz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\t The quizzes will help you, and I see if you learned what was being taught. If you have not then it could be because I need to adjust my delivery of the subject, or it could be an area that you may need to work on, or both. The more comfortable you become with taking online assessments, the easier it will be when you are required to do so in your online degree program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\t Why should you take this course? I am glad you asked me. If you are nervous about pursuing and online degree then you should take this course. If you believe that practice makes perfect then you should take this course. If you think getting advice from someone who has experience then you should take this course. If you want to gain the tools and skills to be successful in an online degree program then you should take this course.</p>",
