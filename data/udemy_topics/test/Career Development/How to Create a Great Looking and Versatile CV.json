    "description": "<p><strong>What is the course about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This course will teach you how present and organise your CV in the way that hiring managers and industry professionals like to see your education and career history highlights presented. So assuming you're looking to get into often highly competitive university programmes or industries, we'll show you how to make sure your CV is formatted in the right way to guarantee it's reviewed amongst the potential hundreds or even thousands of other applicants.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why take this course?</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We believe we've created a truly beneficial course that will really be of help to people in getting the the positions they're applying for and we're confident that our experience makes us very credible in providing such a service.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The creators of this course are graduates from The London School of Economics &amp; Political Science (LSE) and Tsinghua University (清华大学) - universities that have consistently been ranked among the best in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also had successful careers working in Financial Services recruitment roles and have worked with professionals across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and America, successfully placing Analyst to MD level individuals in key financial centres  - London, Hong Kong, Dubai and New York, working day-in-day-out with hiring manager from top tier bulge bracket investment banks, Big 4 consulting firms and premier investment funds globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We've also been helping corporate professionals and students aspiring to work in these prestigious jobs apply for various positions for the better part of a decade and have come to know what works. A big issue we noticed with e.g. people just starting out or coming from non-western hubs i.e. ex US/UK was that their content albeit being strong, didn't conform to the preferred viewing format with the result being that they are then perceived as simply \"not getting it\" and their application being then immediately overlooked. This motivated us to begin offering our services on a mass scale because with the simple tweaks we teach you, you can instantly make sure your CV always goes into the review column and not the \"No\" column which hiring manages unfortunately want to automatically put you in, so as to make their lives easier as they tend to be inundated with applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reviewing 1000s of CVs we're able to confidently advise as to what works and doesn't. There has been a great deal of demand for our services over the years and as our time is a finite resource, we weren't able to help as many people as we'd like with our one-to-one consultancy services. This got us thinking, \"What's a simple and affordable way that we could provide lots of help to lots of people?\" We decided on offering our proven and tested CV format design, where with the click of a button and within about an hour of watching our videos, you could create for yourself a great and professional looking CV that meets the grade, benefitting from hundreds of hours of work that has gone into developing and refining our service through tonnes of R&amp;D.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With this course you save lots of valuable time and energy which you would normally spend when trying to figure out how to have your CV looking the \"right\" way. That's if you're even one of the fortunate few who know that there's a right and a not so right way. With this course, we've done all the leg work for you so there's no need to re-invent the wheel. In addition, you'll save a lot of money because often 100s of $$ would need to be spent to get personal professional help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With competition for top positions constantly getting tougher as the world becomes more and more globalised, we're glad to be helping people improve their chances of success by actually having their CV read as a result of it being presented in the preferred way.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to create a CV that helps you get the position you want, then this course can help you get closer to your goal in a few easy steps. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How long will the course take to complete?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It should take you just over an hour to complete the course. However taking into account the time it'll take you to follow the instructions and make edits to your CV, allow for an extra half an hour or so, depending on the edits you make.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How is the course structured?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course will be step-by-step instructional videos walking you through the process of how to best present the information you have on your CV. We'll start off with a blank document where you simply paste the information you have onto it and then format it properly or you can follow our instructions to create the layout which you can then add your information to later on. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will also include advice throughout on what should and shouldn't be included on your CV and why, and in addition lots of other general tips, dos and don'ts. </p>",
