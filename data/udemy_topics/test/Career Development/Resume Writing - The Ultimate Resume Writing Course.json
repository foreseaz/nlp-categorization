than you often end up getting the job?</p><p>Most people think that the most qualified person gets the job…</p><p>But the truth is, it’s not the <em>most qualified</em> person who lands the job, instead, it’s usually the <strong><em>most prepared person </em></strong>who gets the job!</p><p>And preparation for getting a job begins at your resume…</p><p><strong>Think of it – one of the few things standing between you and your new job, (which can bring you thousands of dollars a month, or even more) is your resume, which is really just a few sheets of paper…</strong></p><p>(But oh, how important those few sheets of paper are!)</p><strong>With tens of thousands of dollars a year at stake, </strong><strong>(or more) </strong><strong>why would you leave this preparation to chance?</strong><p><br></p><p>The truth about resumes is:</p><p>Many resumes don’t even make it past the initial screening process!</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Most resumes get kicked out because they:</p><ul><li>Contain too little information</li><li>Contain too much of the wrong information</li><li>Contain information that does not apply to that job</li><li>Are not properly formatted to “guide the eye”</li><li>Do not convey core strengths that you bring to that job</li><li>Do not “sell” you (or your skills and experience) to the hiring manager</li></ul><p><br></p><p>These are just a few of the common mistakes people make when writing their own resume!</p><strong>And, if you make just a few of these critical errors,</strong><strong>your resume will get flagged by the</strong><strong>“Applicant Tracking System”</strong><strong>which <u>guarantees</u></strong> <strong>that no “human eyes”</strong><strong>will ever see your resume!</strong><p><br></p><p>You see, there are several important things that your resume MUST have, if you want to grab the hiring manager’s attention and increase your chances of landing that job.</p><p>Your resume must:</p><ul><li>Be written in such a way that it passes the Applicant Tracking System</li><li>Capture the hiring manager’s attention by showcasing your unique value to the company.</li><li>Display your measurable, relevant achievments and show how those will benefit the company.</li><li>Meet the hiring manager’s needs by customizing your resume to fit the job description.</li><li>Directs the hiring manager’s eye by placing the right elements in the right places and in the right priority order.</li></ul><p>If your resume <strong>does not </strong>do those things, there’s a good chance your resume will be screened out in the next step of the process!</p><p>So, if you want to be the most prepared person going in for that job, (or if you just want to stop being ignored by the hiring managers, because your resume didn’t make it past their initial screening process) then be sure to read this entire page.</p><strong>The Challenge Of Writing A High-Quality Resume That Gets RESULTS</strong><p><br></p><p>When faced with the challenge of writing a resume (or renewing your existing resume) most people don’t know where to begin.</p><p>Even if you are a decent writer, it can still be a challenge to portray yourself in a positive light “on paper”.</p><p>Worse yet, if you do even a casual internet search for “How to write a resume”, you’ll find all kinds of conflicting
