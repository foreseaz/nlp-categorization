    "description": "<p>Why do my coworkers have success and I don't? Have you ever asked yourself this?</p>\n\n<p>Because I kept missing opportunities, like getting promoted or a bigger salary, I started to believe I can not achieve success in the workplace. My name is Sergiu Nistor, I have worked for a company with more than 9000 employees for over 11 years, and as you can imagine, I have had a lot of ups and downs. I could see some of my colleagues stand out and achieve things I could only dream of. I couldn't understand why I wasn't able to do so as well. I was increasingly getting frustrated by this and I began trying to see why and how I could fix this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I have tried to achieve success by trial and error, until, finally, I found out what this secret: If you want to have success in your professional life you need to know how to identify and solve all the problems you encounter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this course I'm going to teach you how to identify and solve the most frequently encountered workplace problems. They can be generated by you, by your coworkers, by your bosses, by your customers or by the environment you work in. I will discuss situations such as dealing with stress and depression, sharing bad news, people to avoid, coworkers stealing credit or bullying you, meeting deadlines, rejection, feedback, bosses personality types, how to get noticed, and many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything I will teach you was learnt from my own experiences. These are the things that have worked for me and will work for you as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think you can identify and solve any problem instinctively, by doing what your gut tells you, but, the truth is, you need to have knowledge and the recipe for solving each kind of situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel you are not getting the things you deserve at your workplace, this course is for you. You can't afford to wait any longer. Opportunities are passing you by. It's costing you money, professional recognition and a better life for you and your loved ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take this course now.  Your career is going to skyrocket. <br>If, for any reason, you aren't thrilled and satisfied by this course, you are assured trough my no-risk, you-can't-lose, 100%, no-question-asked, iron-clad 30 day money-back guarantee.</p>",
