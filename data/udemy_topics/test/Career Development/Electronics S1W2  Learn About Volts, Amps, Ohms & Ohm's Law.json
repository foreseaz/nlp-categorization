    "description": "<p>  \t  This course is a part of a larger set of courses that will teach you how electronic circuits work. The course semesters include: DC Electronics, AC Electronics, Transistor Theory, Solid State Devices, Communications and Digital Electronics.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course focuses on the first semester of this training, DC Electronics, and the fundamental law of electronics, called Ohm&#039;s Law, named after the person who discovered it almost 140 years ago. You will learn how this Law works and how to accurately apply it to electronic circuits.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Learn and Master Basic DC Electronics</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p>  \t\t  ·Define and explain the relationships between voltage, current and resistance  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·Understand and apply Ohm&#039;s Law to basic electronic circuits  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·Understand the necessary computations to solve any simple circuit and accurately determine the four quantities voltage, current, resistance or power given any two of these.  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">A Powerful Tool for You</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course teaches you the fundamental Law that is the basis for all electronics training that will follow. Electronic engineers, repair technicians, and hobbyists all need this knowledge to excel in their work.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course is part of the beginning of a training journey that will lead to the equivalent knowledge that you would gain by attending a college electronics degree program at a community or for-profit college.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Contents and Overview</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course contains eleven lectures and over two hours of content. It is designed for anyone, regardless of experience level, who wishes to learn the fundamentals of how electronics works.  </p>  <p>  \t  You will learn about the four fundamental characteristics of electronic circuits: Voltage, Current, Resistance and Power.  </p>  <p>  \t  You will learn how to understand and apply Ohm&#039;s Law, the fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance. Your instructor will guide you through with detailed examples, leading to exercises and quiz questions where you demonstrate your ability to accurately and quickly solve circuit problems.  </p>",
