    "description": "<p>  \t    So, here&#039;s how it happened.  It was one of those &quot;Eureka!&quot; moments... sort of like Archimedes&#039; sudden insight while in the bathtub... except Jay was in the shower when he got the idea to do a 3-part seminar to help job seekers in 2009.  </p>  <p>  \t    That idea became the <em style=\"\">Job Search Boot Camp</em>, a live, half-day program covering important topics such as resumes, personal brand, search strategy, interviewing and salary negotiation.  </p>  <p>  \t    And we ended up doing more than just one seminar that year.  We did three... and a whole lot of Mini Job Search Boot Camps at job clubs, churches and community centers across Central Texas.  During that year we also started doing live online broadcasts of the <em style=\"\">Job Search Boot Camp Show</em>, which lasted until late spring 2011.  Those shows, now only available as archived recordings, continue to drawn listeners worldwide... more than 70,000 to date.  </p>  <p>  \t    This particular Mini Job Search Boot Camp program is not a traditional course that you would take in a linear fashion.  Rather, it&#039;s a <em style=\"\">compilation</em> of video snippets from some of our presentations, a few selected lectures from our full Job Search Boot Camp program, selected articles from our Career Blog, as well as some recordings from our online radio show and a few other goodies.  Basically, we&#039;ve pulled together some great pieces of what we teach in the much longer, in-depth Job Search Boot Camp courses, <em style=\"\">READY</em>, <em style=\"\">AIM</em> &amp; <em style=\"\">GET HIRED!</em>  </p>  <p>  \t    In this program, you will:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Get insider tips for readying your your resume from two seasoned career experts.</li>  \t<li>Find out why getting clarity and knowing your personal brand is so important in today&#039;s job market.</li>  \t<li>Learn about a search strategy that is 86% effective in getting you a job.</li>  \t<li>Get advice on how to prepare well so you ACE the interview.</li>  \t<li>Gain some practical ideas on how to take the first step in finding the work you love.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t    By the way, you can find all of the archived recordings of the Job Search Boot Camp Show (2009-2011) at <a href=\"http://www.blogtalkradio.com/jobsearchbootcamp\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">http://www.blogtalkradio.com/jobsearchbootcamp</a>.  </p>  <p>  \t    And you can read more than 300 career articles at <a href=\"http://www.GreatOccupations.com\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">www.GreatOccupations.com</a>.  </p>  <hr style=\"\">  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">NOTE:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t The Total Job Search Boot Camp is a 3-course program.
