    "description": "<strong>Salary Negotiations Introduction and Desired Salary Quoting</strong><strong></strong>  <p>It is estimated that 85% of employers expect job candidates to negotiate salary. The reality is that only 37% to 44% of candidates enter into some type of negotiation. The lack of salary negotiating in your career can cost an average of $500,000 in lifetime lost earnings. In addition, women are much less likely to negotiate than men. Not negotiating is a primary contributor to the female gender pay gap where women make 77 cents of every dollar a man earns.</p>  <p>Let's explore some salary myths and common beliefs.</p>  <p><u>Myth 1. Salary negotiations begin after interviews when the offer is made.</u></p>  <p>In the past, salary negotiations were the final step in the hiring process or, for existing employees, a part of the performance review. Now salary negotiations often <strong>begin at the point of application</strong> to a job.</p>  <p>The following list presents the five points where a salary negotiation may occur:</p>  <ol><li>At the time of      application,</li><li>During the phone screen,</li><li>In the first in-person      interview,</li><li>At the point of a job      offer, and</li><li>During a performance      review.</li></ol>  <p>When “Desired Salary” is used early in the process, the question is essentially turns into the “Guess What the Job Pays” Game.</p>  <p>Here are the rules of the game:</p>        <p>Negotiations don’t even happen if you cannot guess what the employer has decided the job is worth.</p>  <p><u>Myth 2. Salary is not used to screen out a candidate.</u></p>  <p>When applying for a job, the employers may elect to create pre-programmed fields inside the applicant tracking systems to eliminate candidates that do not meet a certain range of salary amounts. These same questions may also be asked during an initial telephone screen or first in-person interview. If salary is discussed this early, the employer is using this information as a way to screen candidates</p>  <p><u>Myth 3. Once the employer makes the offer the interview process is complete.</u></p>  <p>Actually no. When the employer is ready to make an offer, the salary negotiation process is used as the <strong>final interview</strong> in the process.  It is important to know that you are still being evaluated for the job based on how you perform the salary negotiation.</p>  <p><u>Myth 4. The candidate will lose out if they throw the first number.<br> </u>As long as the candidate knows the value of the job, understands the prevailing wages in the professional category, and demonstrates the ability to state their value, a candidate should be in a better position even if they state a range early on. </p>  <p><strong>Guessing what an employer is willing to pay is a critical skill set in income growth.</strong></p>  <p><strong>Please join me in learning what to put for ‘desired salary’ and how to successfully negotiate salary.</strong></p>",
