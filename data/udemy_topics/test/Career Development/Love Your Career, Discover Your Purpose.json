Don’t settle for a “ho-hum”\njob simply because it’s practical, it pays well, it’s all you can get, or it’s\nwhat someone else thinks you “should” do. Embark on a journey inside yourself\nto discover your life's purpose, and then determine a career that will help you\nfulfill it (or use this information to find more meaning in the career you already have)! Learn to capitalize on your natural talents, embrace your passions,\nunderstand your personality, and empower your beliefs about making a living\ndoing what you love and developing your authentic mission here on Earth. It's\nnever too late to find your purpose in life and pursue it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This course is great for <em>anyone </em>who wants to embrace their highest self and live a life of fulfillment and purpose... and it is ESPECIALLY for students, recent grads, career changers, the unemployed, or retirees wanting to find a career or business venture that they love and that fulfills their greater purpose. </strong><br>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*****NOTE: There is an advanced version of this course available for life coaches called Life Purpose Coach Certification. The material in this course is also included in the certification course. Therefore, taking both would be redundant.*****</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   In this course we will challenge you to look at your life experiences and see how they have been a driving force in your life so you can see how the puzzle fits together and helps you see your true purpose.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t <strong>Being Authentically You...</strong> There are some people who have a specific talent that is so extreme that it is easy to detect that they were truly “made” to do it. For the rest of us, determining what we were “made to do” can be a little less obvious. Part of this is because most of us are influenced by our families and society to follow paths that we're “supposed” to do. Our roles, careers, hobbies, and relationships are often chosen more because of our conditioning or because we feel we “should” rather than because they are a fit for who we truly are. It is no surprise that the people who make decisions for their lives based on who they really are and what they genuinely want are more satisfied and more successful. Living a life on purpose means using your natural talents, following your natural interests, and living in alignment with who you truly are. You are doing what you came here to do!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t   Throughout this course we’ll be traversing the “stepping stones to purpose”, or the different elements of our lives and selves that play a role in guiding our path and determining our purpose. At the end of this trail of clues from our pasts and our personalities, you will find that you have discovered your greater purpose for your life!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CONDITIONING</strong>: Overcome limiting conditioning from childhood  and societal influences<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PASSIONS/INTERESTS</strong>: Explore your greatest passions and interests  and discover what you're “made for”<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TALENTS/SKILLS</strong>: Examine your natural talents and the skills you’ve acquired to determine possibilities<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PERSONALITY</strong>: Investigate your personality type and glean  insight into your desires and inclinations<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EXPERIENCES</strong>: Search for patterns or hidden clues in your timeline of life changing experiences<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>COINCIDENCES</strong>: Consider how meaningful coincidences are  often symbolic of greater meaning and purpose<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LIMITING BELIEFS</strong>: Eliminate limiting \nbeliefs systems (B.S.) and  rewrite empowering new ones and overcome common excuses that can hold you back<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EMPOWERMENT</strong>: Empower you to take your power back from  others<br>\n\t\t\t          </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong>: Bring together all of the above \nelements into  a clear statement of purpose and write your personal \nmanifesto as a powerful  declaration of intent</p>",
