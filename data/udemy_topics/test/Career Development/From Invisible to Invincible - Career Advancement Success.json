I always thought that career success is always about climbing the corporate ladder but after this course, I realized that it&#039;s really all about taking opportunities that suit you best... not necessarily being paid more or getting to be called &quot;Sir&quot; by everyone in the workplace. Thank you for this lecture.. really helps in understanding how to approach each and every career opportunity.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Pamela Jean</strong><em><strong><br>\r\n</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\" PIN_1373308917263_hazClick\"><em><strong>In a Career Transition</strong></em><br>\r\n Forced to look outside my chosen profession for employment, I am in the process of getting a PMP certification, to better position myself in the marketplace. I feel well equipped and more at ease after taking this course. One of many key things for me was taking the time to fill out the &quot;Self-Assessment&quot; download that the instructor provides. My goals are clear now and I feel confident that I&#039;ll achieve them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Edward Lee</strong><br>\r\n </p><p class=\" PIN_1373308917263_hazClick\">Each lecture was extremely informative. I was able to get added insight regarding issues that I&#039;m already aware of. I viewed all thirteen lectures and there are two sections that I concentrated on specifically, such as&nbsp; #4-Pitfalls That Stall Your Career Advancement and #6-What You Should Know - Tips From An HR Insider. Overall, I am very impressed with the wealth of information given in this series regarding today&#039;s workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Josephine L. Corbin<em><br>\r\n</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Course Utilization</em></strong><br>\r\n This course is concise, to the point, and written at a level that those wishing to further their careers can walk away armed with precise knowledge. Based on the number of people who have been unemployed this course would be a great training tool that could (and should) be utilized somehow in career centers such as Job Net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n",
