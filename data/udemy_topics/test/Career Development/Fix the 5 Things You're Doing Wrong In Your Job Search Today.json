    "description": "<p>  \t        Course launched in October 2014 and attracted 400 students in the first 24 hours.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Have you been looking for a job but getting nowhere?  </p>  <p>  \t                    Sending out what seems like (or maybe even is) hundreds of resumes and not getting a response?  </p>  <p>  \t                    Going on 1, 2 or 3 job interviews for the same job but not getting an offer?  </p>  <p>  \t                    Everyone tells you that you need to network to get a job, but you don’t know where to start or what to say?  </p>  <p>  \t                    People say that a cover letter is important, but what does it need to say to make it work?  </p>  <p>  \t                    How do you follow up on your application or job interview without turning into a stalker?  </p>  <p>  \t                    This course answers all of these common questions that my clients ask as they navigate the job search. So you’re not alone, and there are definitely right and wrong ways to handle each of those situations.  </p>  <p>  \t                    I have 12 years of experience as a hiring manager. I have been the person who wrote job descriptions for the positions I wanted to fill, reviewed the resumes, conducted the interviews and ultimately made a candidate the job offer.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Since I started my business in 2008, in addition to coaching job seekers on how to get a job, I have also been a recruiter for a variety of positions in multiple industries.  </p>  <p>  \t                    As a hiring manager, and a recruiter, I’m always thinking “is this a great person, but they’re hiding behind a bad resume?” or “is this a great person but they’re too nervous for me to tell if they’re great at their job.”  </p>  <p>  \t                    Nothing is kept secret – I tell you everything I have learned from both sides of the desk--making decisions as a hiring manager/recruiter and “whispering” in my client’s ears to successfully get a job offer.  </p>  <p>  \t                    As well as the Udemy 30 day guarantee, you have my personal promise that this course will give you tips you need to fix your job search today and put you firmly on the right track.  </p>  <p>  \t              And YES I will respond to the questions you pose throughout the course. I&#039;m here to help you get a job. <br>  </p>  <p>  \t                    What this course is not:  </p>  <p>  \t                    This is not intended to be the first place to look to start your job search. It’s meant to talk job seekers through changes you can make to your existing job search strategy. It is not a course on how to start your job search.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Unfortunately due to the volume of students in the course, I am not able to look at your resume or cover letter to give you my opinion. Please take the tips I present here to evaluate your materials.I will answer questions you pose under the discussion section.  </p>  <p>  \t                    I will teach you strategies that I have personally used in my job searches, and recommend strategies based on my perspective as a hiring manager and recruiter. I won’t teach you outrageous things to do to get attention from companies. That would be reckless of me to advise tactics like that when I don’t know the norms and taboos of your industry.  </p>  <p>  \t                    But I can guarantee that I will teach you ways to improve your job search that you haven’t considered before.  </p>  <p>  \t                    You just need to get one job. I’ve helped hundreds of people get their jobs, and they’ve come back to me when they’re ready to move to the next level.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Every minute you delay is actually COSTING you money! Every job you don’t get an interview for, and ultimately a job offer is a lost opportunity.  </p>  <p>  \t                    Looking for a job isn’t a numbers game, the goal is to pinpoint the jobs you are an excellent fit for, and use these strategies to get them.  </p>  <p>  \t            THE PRICE WILL GO UP! And yes, with your lifetime access you&#039;ll also get access to the additional sections I will be publishing in this course.  </p>",
