Simply desaturating your photo in Photoshop won't give you the results you're after. You need to know how to properly convert your images to black and white and how to creatively modify the image to create a true work of fine art. Now that the art form has evolved from film to digital files, how do you work as a modern black and white artist? How can you be sure you're creating the best quality image?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will walk you through the maze of information you need to create great work. You'll learn how to convert raw files to black and white with precise control and edit files with creative vision. You'll learn how to create image files that are professional quality and worthy of archival gallery prints.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You Will Learn and Master</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nailing the correct exposure for digital work</li><li>Converting raw images to black and white</li><li>Creating images with maximum tonal range</li><li>Preserving the subtlety and avoiding digital artifacts</li><li>Creating images that match your artistic vision</li><li>Prepare your files for print</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is divided into three sections:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The Masterful Way, Tools and Gear, and The Creative Process.
