I felt massively overwhelmed by an endless stream of projects and tasks – and so wound up that any trivial glitch could make me explode!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tEventually, I quit my high-stress job. But the stress and anxiety followed me down to the garden office!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI read the advice online and tried all kinds of techniques to change my “negative thinking”. Some seemed to work. My inner stress-bunny was hidden – but still there, ready to jump out whenever times got tough.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIt turns out that I’d been looking for answers in the wrong place.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tModern scientific research has shown that stress isn’t just caused by high-stress jobs and difficult circumstances. It isn’t just caused by “negative thinking”.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIt’s also caused by the electric soup of chemicals in your body that are causing your cells distress. Understand how that works, unplug the power to that soup, and those overwhelming feelings of stress and anxiety will fade away.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI’ve pulled this knowledge together into a short, practical online video course that shows you exactly how you can tackle your stress, step by step. There’s no woo-woo stuff here - <em style=\"\">The Stress-Less Sprint</em> is based on research. It’s also been tried and tested by me – Judy Rees – and my coaching clients around the world.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn this training, I’ll show you how to use your body to change your stressed and anxious feelings, so that you become happier and more productive. Then you’ll be in a strong position to make other changes you want in your life – getting that job, that partner, launching your own start-up or whatever.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe first lecture’s called “Your Body’s Instant Chill Pill” and that’s honestly how fast it works! But the whole process will take a little longer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Review this course and you’ll know <em style=\"\">what</em> to do.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">   Take action</em>, and within 28 days you can expect your level of stress and anxiety to have reduced significantly. You&#039;ll be starting a new chapter in your life.  </p>",
