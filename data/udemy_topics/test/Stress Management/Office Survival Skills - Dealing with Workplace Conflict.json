    "description": "<p>This course is designed for professionals who find conflict at work especially difficult.  You will learn how to cope with workplace bullies, difficult bosses who are micromanagers, and people who enjoy playing mind-games.  You will understand what motivates them, how to recognize their tactics, and the best solutions to use in dealing with their antics. The topic of work-dumping will be discussed, how you should respond to it, and the steps to take in preventing it.  We will look at the blame game, how it works and how to defend yourself from fault and expose the truth.  Working relationships with underperformers will be discussed and methods that you can use to insulate yourself from responsibility for their deficiencies.  Lastly, we will examine how and when to pick your battles and what strategies to pursue in producing a favorable outcome.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p><br style=\"\"></p>",
