Things like purifying water with a gym sock (yes, you can do  this) and building fire with a shoe lace and do some sticks and grass or  a shelter from mud and leaves and all the other awesome and interesting  tricks and secrets used by the modern survivalist to thrive and  abnormal environments .</p>\n\n\n\n<p> However all too often, survivalist even old and  grisly survival experts often neglect their medical training. Or at  least they rely heavily on modern medical kits and neglect the bounty of  Mother Nature's pharmacy that is free for those who know where to look  and how to ask.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing is kept secret - I reveal all I know ... and as I test even more things, those that are successful are added to the course - at no extra cost to you! This is a course that will continue to grow and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the <strong>Udemy 30 day guarantee</strong>, you have my personal promise that you will be wowed and delighted by <strong>what you'll learn in the next 3 to 4 hours ...</strong> and you'll be kicking yourself if you<strong> already had this Udemy course </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tNow  of course we are not talking about performing major surgery with a  stone knife tree moss for bandages and psychedelic mushrooms for  aesthetic but we are talking about taking care of those annoying minor  aches and pains and bumps and bruises that crop up during daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  And although they may not be life threatening. In normal everyday  situations in a survival situation, they can easily lead to major  complications or health problems if not properly dealt with as a simple  bump, bruise or bloody nose can lead to a serious infection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course  will teach you everything you need to know to use Mother Nature's  medicine cabinet to your advantage. You will begin to look at simple  plans, as soothing medicines rather than a simple collection of leaves,  and you'll begin to see flowers as far more than fragrant table  dressings, and instead you will see them for the potent medicines they  truly are.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As With All My Courses:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The initial low price will increase shortly - the course is currently <strong>$20</strong>, but will next increase to <strong>$50</strong></li><li>You have unlimited lifetime access at no extra costs, ever</li><li>All future additional lectures, bonuses, etc in this course are always free</li><li>There's an unconditional, never any questions asked full 30 day money-back-in-full guarantee</li><li>My help is always available to you if you get stuck or have a question - my support is legendary in Udemy</li><li><strong>30 Day 100% Risk Free Offer!</strong></li></ul>",
