    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;One of the best courses I&#039;ve ever seen. This is by far one of the best courses that I have ever taken. The content is very thorough, the pacing is just right and the quality is excellent. I highly recommend this course if you are looking to publish your book in the Kindle store.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t&quot;Best course ever! Cathy can explain everything related to creating, publishing and promoting ebooks MUCH better than everyone I&#039;ve seen. She covers all angles in this course. Take it, you&#039;ll love it, and will learn SO much.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t&quot;This course goes insanely in depth on how to figure out the correct approach to every aspect of creating and launching your ebook. Can you write a book and upload it with some free online tutorial and without the need for this course? Sure! But with others taking this course, your book doesn&#039;t stand a chance at outselling them.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t</em><br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">And I could go on &ndash; but these are all real student reviews and you can read them yourself on this page.<br style=\"\">  \t</strong><br style=\"\">  \tMy job right now is to explain what you&#039;re going to get inside this course and to help you move one step closer to getting your book finished. In this course, you will learn how to publish your ebook on Amazon&#039;s Kindle.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">But why would you want to publish your book on kindle?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tYou might not realise it, but having a book is one of THE best ways to boost your credibility and establish yourself as an expert in your field. Just think about how YOU feel when someone tells you that they are a published author. And maybe even a bestselling author?<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tIt&#039;s also one of the best ways I have found of getting known. Making new connections and bringing people back to your website. And we also talk about good practice in asking those people to sign-up for your email list. And all at zero cost &ndash; no advertising, no need for complex SEO &ndash; your book is targeted at people who are already looking for your information.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">And the great thing is that they are buyers</strong> <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tThey have already bought your book and anyone in business knows that the value of a client or customer who wants the information or service you are offering and has paid for it &ndash; even the small price of a kindle book &ndash;  is worth many times the value of someone just casually browsing.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">But maybe you already know this and you&#039;ve put off writing your book because it seems like such a big project?<br style=\"\">  \t</strong><br style=\"\">  \tNo problem &ndash; I have you covered! <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tFirst of all a book for kindle is probably a lot shorter than you think. Maybe 10,000 to 20,000 words. Not the 50,000 words that a traditional business book might be and certainly not the 200,000 words a big fiction blockbuster would be.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tAnd I give you very clear structures so that the writing part is easy. I won&#039;t go so far as to say the book with write itself, but I do say that clear structures make for easy writing.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Or maybe you really don&#039;t consider yourself to be a writer?<br style=\"\">  \t</strong><br style=\"\">  \tWell, I&#039;m a writer myself and I think you&#039;re best served by publishing your own content - but if you&#039;re STILL not convinced you want to put pen to paper (or you don&#039;t have the time) then I give you ways to get your book done without writing a single word yourself. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Oh but then it&#039;s so complex to actually publish an ebook... <br style=\"\">  \t</strong><br style=\"\">  \tNot at all!<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tAgain and again students tell me how clear the material is and how the small steps I take you through make it manageable and actionable, whatever your level of knowledge.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;It&#039;s All Here. ....well set out, easy to follow (particularly the contents page, and re-formatting the book for kindle, which can get quite complex, but very easy to follow along in this course) .... I have no hesitation recommending this course. Also regular updates, and an author who genuinely is there to support you, is priceless.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t&quot;Cathy provides real value and takes you step by step through the process. This leaves me feeling that the result is achievable. I feel motivated and not overwhelmed.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t&quot;This is one of the most helpful courses that I&#039;ve ever taken. The information is presented in a way that is clear and easily consumed.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t</em><br style=\"\">  \tI know that you can do it - and if you don&#039;t want to then I give you the best places to outsource some of these more technical or administrative tasks.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">And anyway who would want to hear what I have to say?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tWell people who are interested in your subject want to know what you have to say! And if you don&#039;t believe me, look at your own bookshelf or e-reader. Do you have more than one book on topics that you like to read about...? Do you buy another thriller or romantic fiction novel even though you just read a similar one last week...? I certainly do! <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tBecause what readers want is <strong style=\"\">not just more information</strong>. They want information that is presented in a step-by-step fashion &ndash; maybe a <strong style=\"\">&quot;how to&quot; book</strong>. Or they want <strong style=\"\">a different take </strong>on the prevailing view? A reader will get more value out of <strong style=\"\">your story</strong> or <strong style=\"\">your perspective</strong> than you might think - and only you can tell that story.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tWe all have something that is worth saying and I can&#039;t think of a  better, faster or easier way to get your message out than with a digital  book.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Cathy, does your course just apply to non-fiction?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tAll my techniques are tried and tested with my own books. As well as my main books, I have others that I write in a pen name just so that I can trial new techniques and keep up with what is working inside the Amazon platform.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tAnd although my books are non-fiction, I know these techniques work for fiction writers as well. Maybe the market is a little more crowded, and maybe you won&#039;t be a stand-out success with your first book, but the principles of what works are exactly the same.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;VERY useful and practical. ...my book of short stories is already #1 in short stories category on Amazon UK... Strongly recommend to everyone who has or is planning to have a published kindle book. It definitely is worth the price!!!&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t</em><br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">So if you want to get your message into the world, expand your reach, build your brand and your business then I am here to show you easy and fast it is to become a published author.<br style=\"\">  \t</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;...I&#039;ve been on a lot of kindle webinars, listened to top authors  talking about getting a book out there, and I have to say, this course  beats them all....&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t</em><br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Without agents and without publishers.

This is a terrific course! Cathy Presland offers everything you need to know to not only get your book published but to get it ranking well within Amazon. She breaks down everything you need to know and do into bite-sized chunks and shows you how to do each step as you look over her shoulder. I particularly enjoyed her sharing pros and cons of different strategies, which are &quot;optional&quot;, which may be a waste of time etc. I&#039;m all for getting to the goal as quickly as possible! I&#039;ve seen courses in this area that offer much less value than this one does for a whole lot more money so whether you are just beginning on this journey or are already a published author looking for a few new strategies, you will get something from this course.&quot;<br style=\"\">  \t</em><br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What if I have a question once I&#039;m inside the course?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tInside the course there is a place to ask questions and get personal answers from me if there&#039;s anything at all you&#039;re not clear about. And I can promise that that kind of attention is worth the price of admission alone as they say :)<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">&quot;This is really good stuff. Cathy is very responsive to questions, and even revised a section to make it more clear.&quot;</em><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">So what are you waiting for?</strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \tAnd if you STILL have questions you need answered before signing up, feel free to message me here on Udemy or over on facebook &ndash; I want this to be the right fit for you so that you get the absolute best results you can get.<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \tI really hope to see you inside so that you can get started with your book today!<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</strong>  </p>",
