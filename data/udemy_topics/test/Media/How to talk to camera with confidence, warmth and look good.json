    "description": "<p>Would you like to record yourself as a talking head, talking directly to camera for a YouTube video, website intro, Kickstarter promo, or perhaps your own online course?</p><p>Are you completely freaked out by the thought of recording yourself? Or perhaps you've got confidence, but are looking to refine your technique and camera presence?</p><p>This course is designed to get you up and comfortable in front of camera, and to speak with confidence and warmth.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>An engaging camera presence is a mixture of technique, comfort, camera setup, and a well crafted message that you believe in. All of this can be learnt, refined, practiced and achieved.</p><p><strong>The great thing about video is that you don't need to get it right the first time</strong> - you can try and retry as often as you like, and people only ever see the bits that you decide to release.</p><p>I recently launched a course about creating online courses, and every bit of feedback I received included glowing compliments about my engaging camera presence. The thing they didn't see is how many times I forgot my lines, or scratched my nose and decided to re-take.</p><p>What they did see was the result of my years of experience in filming and training presenters, helping talented by shy people to step up to camera, and of course my own experience in talking to camera.</p><p><strong>In this course, I lead you through the steps that have worked for me and others I have helped to captivate an audience on camera.</strong></p><p>These steps start days before you start your \"real\" filming, by helping you refine your message, get comfortable with the idea of talking to a camera, develop your speaking tone, and a method for practicing that's far better than simply talking to the mirror or a friend.</p><p>As you get closer to filming, the course also explores a range of tools and ways you can setup your camera, lights and sound to evoke a particular mood, and even explores how clothes and sleep can affect your videos.</p><p>You will get coaching on your body posture, how and when to emphasise your voice, and what to do with your hands.</p><p><strong>Each lesson in this course gives you practical skills that can help you improve your camera presence, starting from right now.</strong></p><p>Remember that taking this course now gives you access for life, and this is indeed a living course, where I'll be on hand to answer questions, keep you motivated, and create bonus extra lessons based on your feedback.</p><p><strong>Hope to see you inside, and let's get started on improving your camera presence!</strong></p><p><br></p>",
