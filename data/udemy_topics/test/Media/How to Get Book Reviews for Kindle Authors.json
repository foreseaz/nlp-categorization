You have a stunning cover.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBUT &mdash; what you don&rsquo;t have is readers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnless your book just sucks, there is usually ONE reason why no one is buying it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a good chance no one even knows it exists, but the real issue is that it has ZERO reviews on Amazon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe truth is, great books are published every day that never sell and go unnoticed because no one has vouched for them.
