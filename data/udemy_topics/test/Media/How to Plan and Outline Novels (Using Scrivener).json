    "description": "<p>  \t        In this course, Smarter Artist co-founder Sean Platt will show you the step-by-step process our 3-person bestselling author team uses to plan and outline over 2 million words per year of high-quality, reader-loved fiction without hassle, delays, or the frustration most writers face.  </p>  <p>  \t        The most important thing any independent author must do to sell more books and make more money is to &quot;write, publish, and repeat,&quot; getting new work to market fast. <strong>In this course, we&#039;ll show you how to get faster while making your stories richer, deeper, and flat-out better.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        Through ten videos and just under 3 hours of content, you&#039;ll learn a pre-production process we call &quot;story beats&quot; -- a way of planning that combines the thoroughness of traditional outlining with the flexibility and high creativity of &quot;seat of the pants and trusting the story&quot; writing. Having the very best beats in place before writing will take the frustration out of daily writing because you&#039;ll always know your characters, their world, their motivations, and their conflicts. You&#039;ll know what they look like, how they act, and what they&#039;re up to.<br>  \t<br>  \t        Sean will show you this process using our favorite writing program: Scrivener. He&#039;ll show you what to put where, how to use images and the different sections to define your project, and how to show up at the desk tomorrow ready to kick butt and take names.  </p>",
