Just message me for a considerable discount. ---</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong>----------------------------------------</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Build your Newsstand magazine from scratch!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong><strong><br>  \t </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The Newsstand gold rush has just started!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                We all heard that the App Store gold rush is officially over. That might be true for apps but it certainly isn&#039;t true for Newsstand apps/magazines. There are only a handful of magazines on Newsstand and the time to act is now!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>In this course I will show you that anyone can publish on the Newsstand! </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                Newsstand is a built-in application on Apple iOS devices the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. It is dedicated to downloading and displaying digital versions of newspapers and magazines. The most popular and largest printed newspaper and magazine names now publish digital content specifically designed for mobile devices and tablets. Now it&#039;s time for you to do the same and take part in this publishing revolution. You don&#039;t have to be a publisher, you don&#039;t have to know coding or designing! You just need to have the interest to publish on this emerging platform. You will learn all the rest from this course!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The Newsstand myths</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                There are two major myths about publishing on the Newsstand. Once I bust these myths you will be thrilled to join the publishing revolution.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The first myth is that you have to be a publisher</strong>. It is said that you have to own a magazine/newspaper and you have to write your articles. This myth scares you and tells you right in the face: you have to be in the publishing business. That is absolutely not true. There are hundreds of magazines out there that aren&#039;t from huge publishing firms, so don&#039;t dare tell yourself you can&#039;t do the same.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The second myth is that it&#039;s way too expensive.</strong> Well, it is, but not if you take this course. Let&#039;s take a look at the fees that publishing sites take. The above is for geeky people (I know I am one) with stats and figures. The main point is this:  </p>  <p>  \t<em>If you take this course publishing on the Newsstand will cost you less than <strong>$50/month</strong>;</em>  </p>  <p>  \t<em>If you use other publishing platforms it will cost you <strong>$300+/month</strong>.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t                I will present the price that best fits for a comparison for this course (unlimited apps, unlimited issues, unlimited devices etc.):  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><a href=\"http://www.magplus.com/features-price/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mag+</a> $2999/month (there&#039;s also a $399/month with a lot of limitations!) </li>  \t<li><a href=\"http://www.magcasting.co\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">MagCast</a> $297/month</li>  \t<li><a href=\"http://www.tapedition.com/pricing.php\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TapEdition</a> $299/month (only 5000 downloads/month!)</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t                This course = <strong>$50/month or less!</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Now that&#039;s about TEN TIMES CHEAPER than the cheapest publishing platform offers you! How is this possible?</strong>  </p>  <p class=\"PIN_1373027091092_hazClick\">  \t                The answer is easy! You have to use 1 secret tool. It is secret because it&#039;s so awesome.
