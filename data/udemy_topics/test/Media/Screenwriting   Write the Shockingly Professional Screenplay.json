    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t <strong>Writing a professional screenplay that stands out from the competition doesn't have to be a confusing mystery or heartbreakingly painful. Let me show you how I've been doing it for years.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                 My name is Jeffrey Alan Schechter and I've been a <strong>working writer</strong> for over 20 years.  My writing has been nominated for<strong> two Emmy awards</strong> as well as awards from the <strong>Writer's Guild of America, the Writer's Guild of Canada</strong>, and the <strong>British Academy of Film and Television Arts</strong>. I'm a <strong>Gemini award winning producer</strong> and the author of the bestselling book <em>My Story Can Beat Up Your Story! </em>, Amazon's top-reviewed book on screenwriting. I'm also the creator and executive producer of the hit show <em><strong>Stitchers</strong></em> currently airing on ABC Family.  I know this isn't the least expensive screenwriting course on Udemy but every once in a while you <strong>do</strong> <strong>actually get what you pay for.</strong>  This  course is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to turn your screenplay into the toughest kid on the block or your money back.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                 What I teach is no sterile paradigm, no BS system taught by failed writers. This is the<strong> same dynamic system</strong> that I've used in my 20+ year career as a working writer. It <strong>decodes the major storytelling moments</strong> shared by the <strong>most popular movies of all time</strong> so you can use them in your own writing. This system is based on simple to understand principles that I've used to generate <strong>millions of dollars in writing assignments and script sales.</strong> Seriously.  It really works.  </p>  WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?  LOTS!  <blockquote style=\"\">  \t                 Jeff has an acute understanding of the kind of story structure that makes for successful movies.  By analyzing blockbusters he extrapolates a story construction model that is surprisingly simple and universally applicable.  And, best of all, it works. <strong><em>- Tim Hill, Director.  ALVIN &amp; THE CHIPMUNKS, MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE, MUPPETS IN SPACE</em></strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                 Writers have been searching for the perfect story structure paradigm for 2,500 years.  Jeff Schechter may have found it.  Take that, Aristotle! <strong><em>- Ian Abrams, Chairman, Dramatic Writing Program, Drexel University. Writer/ Creator EARLY EDITION, UNDERCOVER BLUES.</em></strong> <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t               Screenwriting is an art, and Jeff Schechter conveys both the craft and soul of the trade.  A gifted teacher, he provides methods which will help you both structure and elevate your best ideas. <strong><em>- David Sacks, Executive Producer/Writer.  THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN, THE SIMPSONS</em></strong> <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                   A refreshing, no-nonsense, incredibly insightful primer for beginners and laser-guided tuner-upper for journeymen.  And it's damned entertaining to boot. <em><strong>David N. Weiss, writer, Shrek 2, The Smurfs</strong></em> <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                 Smart and engaging...brims with common-sense methods of breaking down and conquering the most stubborn structural problems in screenwriting.<strong><em>Alvaro Rodriguez, writer, Machete, Shorts</em></strong><br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t                 Since I took Jeff's course I've become a Hollywood screenwriter.  I recently finished the first draft of a supernatural thriller which I was able to option after my FIRST PITCH to a producer.  Now I'm on my next 'gig.'  If it wasn't for Jeff I would still be writing my way out of page 55.\" <strong><em>– Scott M, AUSTRALIA </em></strong> <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t          Jeff breaks down screenwriting structure into small, easy to understand bites.  I finally think I'm comprehending screenwriting and how it works, and I owe it all to this class.  If you only take one screenwriting class, make sure it's this one!\" <strong><em>– Elissa T, LONG BEACH </em></strong>  </blockquote>  WHAT'S IN THE COURSE?  <p style=\"\">  \t                 This course is divided into four sections covering 41 lectures:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong>SECTION 1 -- STRONG FOUNDATIONS</strong>: Three acts, four questions, four archetypes &amp; the perfect elevator pitch.
