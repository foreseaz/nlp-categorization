    "description": "<p>\r\n\t      Theatre is the oldest form of dramatic storytelling, and many still consider it the most electrifying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      Nothing beats the intensity of actors sharing the same air as the audience. The laughs, gasps and tears happen live and on the spot. But before a great play is performed, a great play has to be written and somebody has to write them. You are here because you want to be counted among those who write and write well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t      A play will not soar in performance unless it&#039;s great on the page.
