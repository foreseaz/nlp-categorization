With a computer and the right software, almost anyone with good ideas, a way with words can be an author.  </p>  <p>  \t      The fact that I wrote a book took my business to the next level, opened doors which were previously closed and attracted more clients than I could ever dream of.  </p>  <p>  \t      Having a book is the best business growth tool and I will show you in the Book Catalyst Programme how to write your book in less than 24 hours and generate 3 additional revenue streams. From the moment you start writing your book you will establish yourself as an authority, expert and market leader in your field sooner than if you used traditional business growth methods.  </p>    <ul style=\"\">  </ul>",
