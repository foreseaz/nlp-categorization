    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      In the next 60 minutes learn how to create, proof, publish and list your children&#039;s picture book and sell paperback copies of your book on Amazon.  Order your first book proof this afternoon!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This course assumes that you are at the stage where you have a children&#039;s book written or are in the process of writing and illustrating one and an unsure of what to do when you finish it.  How do you get it in print?  How do you sell it?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This is a quick crash course on how to use a &quot;Print-on-demand&quot; service called Createspace which is completely free and is affiliated with Amazon.com.  Print on demand (or &quot;POD&quot;) book publishing means that when someone purchases your book on Amazon, one book is printed and shipped out.  The printing company makes their money every time a book is sold which means there is no upfront cost to you to print 100 or 1000 books.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     POD is a no-risk way to self publish your books.  I am not personally affiliated with Createspace whatsoever, but have been using the service for years and would not choose anything else.  I enjoy self-publishing and being in control of my books and would recommend it for any author who is starting out and trying to avoid risks or being taken advantage of by a publisher.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    In order to get started, you should first create a free user account at www.Createspace.com and set up your royalty pay-out information.  IE, link your account to your Paypal account or bank account so that you can get paid.  You will need to set up this information prior to creating your book listing.  </p>",
