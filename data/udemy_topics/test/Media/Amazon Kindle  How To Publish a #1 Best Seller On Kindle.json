So many books and so cheap â€“ how can anyone get ahead?  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              But the truth is most people who take that leap of faith and publish  their books on Amazon don't have a clue about how to optimize their  description page and other segments of the Kindle platform, and they  don't understand how to market their book successfully after it is  published.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              That's where this video series can help. <strong>In these video  tutorials, you'll learn step-by-step techniques for bumping your Kindle  book creation to the top of Amazon's bestseller list. A nice place to  be.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                Here's your chance to access my proven and effective 7-step system that  I've personally used to generate #1 best sellers across multiple Amazon  Kindle categories.
