    "description": "<p>  \t  Amanda Hocking. John Locke. E.L. James. All ordinary folks. Banking SERIOUS self-publishing coin.  </p>  <p>  \t  All because The Digital Revolution has levelled the playing field for artists of all disciplines. Now you can record a studio quality CD in your bedroom. Write and upload a novel from your computer! Incredible, wouldn't you agree?  </p>  <p>  \t  But as incredible as the digital revolution is, it only gives you <u>ACCESS </u>to the game. It doesn't increase your chances of <u>WINNING </u>the game. Only <em><u>KNOWLEDGE </u></em>can do that. Knowledge of your market, it's trends, it's procedures. Knowledge of your competitors,their U.S.P., their marketing methods, etc.  </p>  <p>  \t<em><u><strong>In a sentence: the digital revolution gives you an opportunity, NOT an advantage.</strong></u></em>  </p>  <p>  \t<u>Your advantage - is KNOWLEDGE. And that's what this course will give you. </u>  </p>  <p>  \t  Knowledge of every aspect of  the business of self-publishing. And make no mistake - it is A BUSINESS. Which requires an investment of time,energy and, yes, money.  </p>  <p>  \t  If you're a writer who wants to become a SUCCESSFUL self-published Author, or a published Author who's in \"sales limbo\", the knowledge in this course will give you the advantage you need to make the most of the digital self-publishing opportunity.  </p>  <p>  \t  There is no filler here. No fluff. Every fact is a proven one. Every evaluation comes from my years of experience as a Literary Agent, “Book Doctor.\" and Publisher.</p>  <p>  \t  Equally, you'll find no - what I call - \"phony inspiration\"  here. No -\"You can be the next ebook millionaire if you believe in yourself, chant my 'success affirmations' and follow my 10 step ninja success videos.”  </p>  <p>  \t<u>My goal is to inspire you with </u><strong>KNOWLEDGE.</strong> And have you transform that knowledge into <em><strong>ACTION!</strong></em> Because without it, knowledge has no value.  </p>  <p>  \t  Knowledge IS power. This course IS knowledge.  </p>  <p>I look forward to helping you achieve your Literary goals.<br></p>",
