    "description": "<p>Become a voice over expert in under 3 hours. Improve the quality of your voice overs to get more clients, make more sales or grow your audience.</p><p><em>High quality = instant trust from the viewer/listener/client.</em></p><p><strong>In this course, you will learn advanced techniques and strategies that will put you ahead of the competition.</strong><br></p><p>These are the exact same systems and techniques that professional engineers use to produce broadcast and film quality voice overs.</p><p>Not only that, but using the techniques that you will develop in this course you can produce great voice overs every time (without fail) and in <em>half the time.</em></p><p><strong>Imagine that feeling when your voice not only sounds great, but it also takes you no time at all!</strong></p><p>If you have recorded voice before and have a basic grasp of microphones, computer recording and editing, EQ and compression then this course is for you. It’s also the perfect follow up course for students who have completed Record Voice Like A Pro: The Complete Guide.</p><p><strong>This is the first advanced voice over course on Udemy. In fact, I’m pretty sure it’s the first advanced voice recording course on the internet (that I’m aware of).</strong> </p><p>There are no other courses taught by professional engineers like myself, and no other courses that go into these advanced techniques and strategies.</p><p>This is a continuation from my complete course on voice recording (Record Voice Like A Pro: The Complete Guide), which is the most popular paid voice over course on Udemy with over 1,893 students and 33 excellent reviews (the most popular <em>free</em> voice over course is also mine, with over over 5,621 students and 115 reviews).</p><p><strong>This course is NOT for <em>absolute</em> beginners.</strong> It’s not for people who have never recorded voice before. Not for people who don’t have an awareness of the different types of microphone. Not for people who don’t understand what EQ, editing and compression are.</p><p>This course is also not for people who want someone else to do the work for them. This course is not for lazy people! </p><p>It will require some active listening and practice on your part. </p><p><strong>But with me guiding you along the way it will be easy. You can become a voice recording expert in a fraction of the time that it usually takes.</strong></p><p>Ask yourself - how much is your time worth? </p><p>The voice mixing process alone would take you over 200 hours to develop and figure out yourself.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, you could figure all of this out yourself the hard way. Most people do.</p><p><strong>Or you could take this shortcut and start putting out great voice overs sooner by avoiding all of the mistakes I’ve made.</strong></p><p>You clicked on to this course (and you’ve read this far) so you’re obviously the kind of person that this course is made for: people that care about high quality and are going out of their way to pursue it.</p><p>This course is a no-brainer if you want to:</p><ul><li>Record voice overs that sound 10x better than the rest</li><li>Avoid that frustrated feeling you get every time something goes wrong or your voice over doesn’t sound good (and you just can’t figure out why)</li><li>Get an edge of the competition by producing professional, high quality voice overs</li><li>Cut the entire recording/processing process in half by using my proven techniques and systems for increased efficiency</li><li>Get an amazing sound at the source that you can sculpt to perfection with editing and mixing (rather than spending all your time just trying to fix it)</li><li>Make money as a voice over talent for films, audio books, presentations, informational videos and more (it’s quite achievable to earn $70+ per hour on UpWork or a similar outsourcing website - take a look for yourself, just search ‘voice over’)</li><li>Turn your normal recording location into a professional voice over studio.</li><li>Learn how to use high end equipment and hardware to get the best sound possible</li><li>Discover the secrets to professional quality voice overs, such as gain staging, parallel processing, advanced compression, subtractive EQ, limiting and more.</li><li>Take yourself to the next level in voice over quality in the shortest time possible</li><li>Build upon your current knowledge about voice recording and get out the rut that you’re stuck in (you’re limited by your own knowledge and lack of awareness of professional mixing techniques)</li></ul><p>All of this and more is covered over the four main sections of the course: Equipment, Recording, Editing and Mixing.</p><p>Remember, not only will you get access to a great course that will teach what you absolutely need to know about recording voice, <strong>but it will also give you the momentum you desperately need to improve your voice overs, get more clients, make more sales or get more views.</strong></p><p>Take this course now before it gets lost in the shuffle of life.</p><p>See you on the inside :)<br><br></p>",
