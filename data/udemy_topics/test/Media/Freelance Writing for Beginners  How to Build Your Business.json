Want to make money online? Learn how by becoming a freelance writer. Whether you're creating a book for Kindle or doing blogging gigs, there's never been a better time to pull in extra money writing than right now.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t      With tens of thousands of blogs being built daily, there's an ongoing need for a LOT OF CONTENT. Oftentimes businesses don't have enough staff or enough know-how to write short blog posts or repurpose press releases or product info into blog posts.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t      In addition, Amazon's Kindle has opened up a whole new world to people who want to self-publish books, from short 20 page \"quick guides\" to full-length novels. In addition, there's an ongoing need for writers who can do quick gigs for other writers, including creating multi-media one-page sites to help with promotions.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t      You'll learn how to take advantage of all of these opportunities during this course.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Learn from an expert!</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    As a life-long freelance author, I've worked on some of the most amazing projects you can imagine. My clients have included top notch achievers in such diverse industries as aerospace, medicine, housing, finance, military, education, publishing, collecting, history, and many, many more.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    As a writer, I've interviewed deep sky astrophotographers, CEOs, renewable energy experts, artists, and highly successful consultants â€“ and I hold back nothing in my Udemy courses.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Why should you listen to me?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<em><strong>Published Books</strong></em>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    I've written 29 books on topics ranging from astronomy to history, technology, photography and writing. Google my name over on Amazon and you'll see the wide variety of my published books. I'm currently writing a travel series to document in words and photos the trips I've made to some of the most historic and remote backroads of America.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong><em>Magazines &amp; Web Content</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    I've written hundreds of magazine and web articles, including History Magazine, techEdge, ID, Writer's Digest, The Writer, San Diego Parent, Today's Collector, Discovery.com, Personal Journaling, and Laptop.
