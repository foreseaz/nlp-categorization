    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t A 6-hour, deeply immersive look into cinematic lighting, with parodies of  programs such as <em style=\"\">Mythbusters</em>, <em style=\"\">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and  <em style=\"\">What Not to Wear</em>.  We cover common mistakes, hard and soft light, using  shadows, proper exposure and exposure tools, lighting technique, creating a mood  with light, all built around meeting the ARTISTIC GOALS of your film/video  project.  We then talk about all of the lighting and grip gear, have an  interview with Levie Isaacks, A.S.C, and more.  And then, we showcase two short films we made specifically for  this set (watch them now, for free!), and sit down with the cinematographer and director in an hour-long,  behind-the-scenes featurette breaking down everything that was done to light the  films, and we show our lighting lessons as applied to in real-world film  production settings -- with the results to show for it!  </p>",
