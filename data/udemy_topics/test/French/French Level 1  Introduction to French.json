    "description": "<p>  \t      French Level I is an introductory level course on the French language. Learners will be introduced to a variety of French language conventions, grammar, and vocabulary. By the end of the course, successful learners will be able to introduce themselves to others, pose and respond to simple questions, and carry on a basic conversation all in French. There are no prerequisites for this course.  </p>  <p>  \t      This course is comprised of video lectures and learning activities (quizzes) to help solidify your learning, and it is taught by an experienced, bilingual French teacher. </p>  <p>  \t      French is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world and is the official languages of countries all across the world. Learning a second language will make you more marketable for future employment. Being able to speak a second language will make travelling easier as well. There are also a number of cognitive benefits to learning a second language. Some studies suggest that learning a second language is a great way to keep your mind in shape.  </p>  <p>  \t  It is recommended that learners focus on one lesson per week. Thus, ideally, the course should take each learner about 9 weeks to complete. Learners are able to progress at their own speed and are able to finish the course before or after the 9 week suggested period.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course is a self-directed course and the instructor is present to act as a guide to foster learning and answer any questions that the learner may have. This format allows more convenience for the learner to progress at their own speed.  </p>",
