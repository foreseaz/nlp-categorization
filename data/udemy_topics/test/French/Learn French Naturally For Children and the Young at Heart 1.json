This course teaches French primarily through <strong>stories </strong>and <strong>conversation</strong>, which is how our brains naturally learn languages. It is designed for <strong>beginners ages 8 and above</strong> who have had no experience with French, or for those who want to <strong>freshen up </strong>their French.</p><p>If you want to learn how to actually <strong>use the language</strong> without having to memorize a bunch of grammar, then this course is for you.</p><p>After completing this course you and your child will be able to <strong>understand </strong>and <strong>use </strong>basic high-frequency French which will <strong>open doors</strong> to French conversation, travel, culture, and true joie de vivre.
