In this course, I focus on teaching powerful lessons like: <strong>Hidden Resources, Value Propositions, Leveraging Value, Social Media, Taking a Company to the Next Level and so much more...!</strong> I don't just teach these lessons, I provide enough examples to create an experience you <strong>can learn from!</strong></p><p> These lessons are taught <strong>face to face</strong>, <em>in a quick, aggressive way</em> (with examples played in separate lectures). I made this course for a very specific reason: <strong>t</strong><strong>o give marketers/storytellers the knowledge it takes to build a powerful brand.</strong> If every company applied these lessons to their unique story,<strong> they would make big things happen, daily.</strong></p><p> I made this course for:</p><p>• Anyone with character and self awareness</p><p>• Marketers who want to dive deeper into marketing </p><p>• Anyone who has a story to tell </p><p>• Anyone wanting to fuse business with their unique vision </p><p> I genuinely admire people who work hard for what they want. Character and Self Awareness always seem to be the main ingredients for long-lasting success. </p><p>What you will need: </p><p>• Willingness to learn (an open mind)</p><p> • Willingness to act</p><p> • Willingness to work hard and learn concepts (not as easy as you may think) </p><p>I have dedicated my life to making the world a better place. This course is the first installment in a long line of online products I am creating. All products have a purpose and were created to disrupt the market. I will never create a course that I felt you could buy from someone else. I'm here for value. I'll see you inside! </p><p>Your proud instructor, </p><p> Nik Koyama  </p>",
