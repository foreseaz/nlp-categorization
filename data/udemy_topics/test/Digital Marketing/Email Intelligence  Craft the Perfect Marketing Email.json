If that's what you've been doing, then </strong><em>you're doing it all wrong</em><strong>.</strong></p><p>An effective email marketing strategy depends on emailing your subscribers, users and customers at the right place and at the right time â€“ and I don't mean delivery times. I mean sending emails based on where they are in your marketing cycle.</p><p><em>So are subject lines and design important?</em><br></p><p>Yes. </p><p>They aren't the deciding factor in whether they will open up your email or not. There is a greater science to it.</p><p>A great email marketing strategy consists of the following:</p><ul><li>The recipient understands why they have received this email and they <em>expect it.</em></li><li>They have been guided throughout your buying process through an educational marketing strategy so your email is helpful NOT salesy.</li><li>Your email is unique, personal and designed for EACH individual.</li></ul><p>If your want your emails to be opened, engaged and result in a transaction, then you need to keep these things in mind. </p><p><strong>Ultimately, these are the things that built trust and trust is what gets emails opened, not subject lines.</strong></p><p>This course is about building trust with your customers. </p><p>We will provide you with many examples (135 to be exact) divided into five categories and  41 sub-categories. All of the examples explained in detail as WHY they actually work.</p>",
