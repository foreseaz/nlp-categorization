    "description": "<p><strong>Course Updated: Jan 2016</strong></p><p><strong>JOIN OVER 2000+ STUDENTS IN A GROWING COMMUNITY WHO ARE GENERATING MORE SALES LEADS FOR THEIR BUSINESS EVERY DAY.</strong></p><p><strong>Want To Generate More Sales For You Business?</strong></p><p><em>Who doesn't, right?</em> With a proven step-by-step guide that's turned my own business from a bedroom start up to a £480,000+ agency (see the proof lesson below), <em>YOU CAN TOO!</em> If you're ready for hard work that delivers proven results, then read on...</p><p><strong>You need consistent quality sales leads... I'll show you how.</strong></p><p>Just the the other day I landed a £50,000 project and over 2100 people are already benefiting from my step-by-step plan (see the proof lesson below). Infact I'm that certain you'll grow your business by following my plan, I'll 30 day money-back guarantee it. Excited? Yeah me too, let's dive right in...</p><p><em><strong>\"BUT I'M NOT AN EXPERT!\"</strong></em></p><p>Join the club, because I don't have the traditional PhD, I don't give enormous theory lessons in consumer behaviour at Cambridge University. But I have designed, developed and marketed 100s of successful websites over the years and learnt so much in the process.</p><p>I know you can learn from my knowledge on digital marketing and lead generation, then apply it through the step-by-step plan. I'm not the golden boy of digital marketing, but I'm a long way ahead of the majority.</p><p>You'll be the same in your field of work – I know you're a hard grafter and you know your stuff. You just need a guide and plan to implement digital marketing to increase your businesses visibility and generate quality leads.</p><p>Every entrepreneur, business owner and marketer I've met over the last ten years has felt outside of their comfort zone at some point, that's how we push ourselves to improve and skill up. You're not going to be a marketing guru at the end of this, but you'll have a ton of skills that will put you ahead of those that are doing nothing. This is your opportunity – take it.</p><p><strong>FOLLOW A PROVEN PLAN</strong></p><p>By following this plan myself, in 2015 my company (Newedge) generated over £1,000,000 of great quality leads in the last 12 months, which we converted at around 50%! Now I know there is room for improvement there, and we would like to be converting more – but what's you conversion rate? Do you even know? Don't worry if you don't – we'll work it out inside the step-by-step plan.</p><p><strong>START FROM ZERO</strong></p><p>Building a lead generation sales funnel is hard work and takes time. It's especially difficult if you don't have clarity. But a plan changes that.</p><p>Just the action of writing the step-by-step plan will give you focus and will make digital marketing a substantially easier beast to tame. In the last 12 months, Newedge has secured nearly £500,000 of revenue by following this plan, with a £0 spend on advertising.</p><p>With the right mindset, a solid digital marketing plan, a little consistency and discipline, plus a lot of effort, you can grow your sales funnel and reach your goals.
