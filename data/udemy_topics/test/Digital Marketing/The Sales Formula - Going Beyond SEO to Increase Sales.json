    "description": "<p>  \t            A few years ago we discover something amazing while performing SEO and digital marketing work for some clients. When we took a look at all of our successful clients (companies that consistently attracted new customers on a regular basis without spending a ton of money on advertising), we noticed simple patterns that all of them shared.  </p>  <p>  \t            It was then we realized that we had discovered a gold mine of knowledge, a series of simple, repeatable steps that any business owner could use for themselves - so we created a 45 minute video course and called it &quot;The Sales Formula&quot;. The course includes 10 videos and multiple downloadable PDF Quick Reference Guides you can refer back to any time.  </p>  <p>  \t            Once we started using The Sales Formula for all our clients, each and every one of them instantly began receiving more phone calls and emailed request for quotes.  </p>  <p>  \t            The approach is so simple, but its still a night and day difference from how most companies approach getting new clients online.  </p>  <p>  \t            The best part is that there&#039;s no advertising involved. No pay-per-click campaigns, no banner ads, no snail mail or expensive consultants. Everything we learned you can do using your own blog or website.  </p>  <p>  \t            If you&#039;ve had enough of people calling you trying to sell  you another advertising package, or you&#039;ve tried everything and given up on ever getting business from the Internet, then you&#039;ll love The Sales Formula.  </p>  <p>  \t    This is a digital marketing course is highly focused on Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Internet Marketing, Digital Marketing, Business Promotion, and sales development.  </p>",
