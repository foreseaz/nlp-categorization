    "description": "<p>Customer lifecycle is a\nterm used to describe the progression of steps a customer goes through in\nbecoming a regular loyal customer. This involves stages like considering,\npurchasing, using, and maintaining loyalty to a product or service. The goal of\nLifecycle Marketing is to tailor marketing communication based on the lifecycle\nstage of the customer. This course introduces the customer lifecycle as the\ntool to create market strategy which is customer focused. The course will also\nhelp you identify the lifecycle stage of a customer and hence develop a\nmarketing strategy based on that. The idea is that, while the goal is always\nthe same – developing loyal, repeat customers – there are different tactics and\nmessages that are likely to resonate most with customers at different stages in\nthe customer lifecycle. For example, the way you would interact or communicate\nwith a new customer is very different from the way you would communicate with a\nlong-time customer who is showing signs of lapsing.</p>",
