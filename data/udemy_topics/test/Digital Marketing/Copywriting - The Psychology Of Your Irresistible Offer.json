I work as a <strong>Marketing</strong> Manager, I teach very successful courses on <strong>Marketing</strong> Fundamentals and <strong>Marketing</strong> Psychology and Copywriting. I’ve created and launched over <strong>20 digital products</strong>. I also teach over <strong>12000</strong> <strong>students </strong>from 128 countries. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So much for me, let’s see what you are going to learn:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course will learn how to create and present irresistible offers that people buy! This is a part of the art and science of copywriting and as one of the most successful copywriters who has ever lived said:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>It Is The Deal... The Offer... The Proposition<br> You Are Making That Is The Heart And Soul<br> Of Great Copywriting!</em>“ <strong>G</strong><strong>ary Halbert</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have some experience with copywriting, if your offer is poorly presented you will have terrible results. Because strong copy will not overcome a weak offer, but in many cases, a strong offer will succeed in spite of weak copy written by marketing morons.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HERE'S JUST A SMALL GLIMPSE OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN INSIDE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The top <strong>8      psychological elements</strong> to include in your marketing offer.</li><li>How to      present your price so it looks like the <strong>best deal ever</strong>, even if you sell a      product or service for $500.</li><li><strong>How to      “frame” your value proposition.</strong></li><li>The number      one <strong>question </strong>prospects have in their minds – if you don’t address this      question your sales will suffer.</li><li>How to <strong>communicate clearly </strong>and get      your message across with <strong>100% accuracy</strong> every time.
