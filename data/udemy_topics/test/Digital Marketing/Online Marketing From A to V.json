Right from the first video I discovered new tips I could use for cross promotion. Carol covers so many products and demonstrates a good knowledge about each. This course has much more information than I imagined. It would take me days to learn on my own what she covers in each short video. Taking notes is essential for implementing the ideas. - <em>Rosalie Garde</em></em></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<em><em></em></em></p><em>  </em><p><em>  \t  </em>While we've skipped over a few of the letters of the alphabet, we  managed to start with A and talk about Audio Marketing and end with V  for Video Marketing. Each of these videos walks through different  methods for promoting yourself and your business online without expense  or technical knowledge. We cover methods for building your home on the Internet, sharing your expertise, and promoting yourself using social media, audio, and video. </p>",
