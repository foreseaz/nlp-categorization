    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"\">For 26 years I read books and articles and followed all of the dieting rules. I had nothing to show for it except successes followed by regaining the weight. I felt worthless and wondered if anyone would miss me should I fall into a black whole. In 2013, I found the book <em style=\"\">Intuitive Eating, 3rd edition</em> and it led me to become a certified Intuitive Eating Counselor. The way I see food <em style=\"\">and</em> myself has changed dramatically. It&#039;s time to teach others what I know....</span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<span style=\"\"></span>This is an introductory course that will teach you what it means to <strong style=\"\">stop dieting forever</strong> and reconnect with the Intuitive Eater within you. You will learn:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">the definition of the term &quot;Intuitive Eater&quot;</li>  \t<li style=\"\">that you are not alone when it comes to dieting and how it has effected the way you view yourself AND food</li>  \t<li style=\"\">what dieting has done for us as a society</li>  \t<li style=\"\">your most common eating style</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how you became disconnected from your Intuitive Eater</li>  \t<li style=\"\">the 10 principles that will help you reconnect with your Intuitive Eater</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how the reconnection process works</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \tYou do not need to purchase anything more in order to complete this course. I do highly recommend reading the book <em style=\"\">Intuitive Eating, 3rd edition</em> written by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch. This book can be found in book stores as well as at Amazon.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This course is about an hour in length and will give you good overview of what it means to reconnect with your Intuitive Eater. Take your time, take notes and feel free to start a discussion with any questions you may have.  </p>",
