    "description": "<p>  \t<u style=\"\">  The Course That Rewires Your Brain For Lean, Healthy Eating</u>  </p>  <p>  \t              If you&#039;re like most people, anytime you want to lose weight you probably go on a diet. Here&#039;s the problem. When it comes to weight loss, your DIET is extremely important...but GOING ON A DIET is different.  </p>  <p>  \t              Going on a diet doesn&#039;t work--and that&#039;s pretty much a fact at this point. Loads of studies and research confirm this pretty conclusively. (Watch the first free preview video lecture to learn why.)  </p>  <p>  \t              See, trying to lose weight by going on a diet is like going into a garden that&#039;s overrun with weeds...and TRIMMING the weeds, instead of pulling them out by the roots.  </p>  <p>  \t              Yeah, that might make things look better for a little while, but it doesn&#039;t fix the source of the problem. And because the roots are still there under the surface, the weeds quickly grow back--just like your love handles always seem to grow back.  </p>  <p>  \t              If you&#039;ve been unable to get the body you desire, and the body you deserve, it&#039;s probably because you&#039;ve been trying to change your end behaviors (the foods you eat, the exercises you do) without first creating the right foundation of habits &amp; beliefs to support these new behaviors.  </p>  <p>  \t              You see, real weight loss doesn&#039;t begin on your plate. And it doesn&#039;t begin in a gym. It begins...in your head. Because that&#039;s where you form your beliefs, forge your habits, and make the little day-to-day decisions that add up to make you the person you are today.  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      And that&#039;s why in this course you&#039;ll learn how to lose weight by starting at the root source of the problem. (Lecture Four)  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      You&#039;ll learn how to re-wire your brain for healthy eating that&#039;s automatic (no willpower required) using the science of neuroplasticity. (Lecture Twenty-Two)  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      You&#039;ll learn how to find where your limiting and disempowering beliefs are hiding, and replace them with more empowering beliefs and a stronger self-image. (Lecture Seven)  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      You&#039;ll learn how to avoid the common weight-loss pitfalls you keep falling into, again and again, without even realizing it. (Lecture Eight)  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      Finally, and most importantly, you&#039;ll learn how start thinking like a lean person...so you&#039;ll start acting like a lean person. (Lecture Twenty-Four)  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      And before you know it, you&#039;ll BE a lean person--inside and out.  </p>  <p>  \t                                                      * Note: This is not a diet. This is a mental reframing system that you can use with ANY diet in the world--including no diet at all, if you prefer to simply eat the foods you enjoy and still lose weight at a slow but steady clip. *  </p>",
