    "description": "<p>  \t    Body 4 Believers is a nutrition program that instructs how to eat normal everyday foods in a way that removes fat from the body. Great benefits are accomplished in the implementation of the disciplines we instruct. Over the last 70 years we have compromised our nutrient input by replacing fiber with refined carbohydrates. This has caused a epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We instruct a healthy balance of nutrients for feeding the body properly.  This results of feeding our body well is fat loss and new-found energy. It is amazing how our health can return. I have personally witness the rebound of health and energy of hundreds that I have instructed in the implementation of these disciplines. We don&#039;t need more gimmicks just to learn how to eat normal everyday foods.  </p>",
