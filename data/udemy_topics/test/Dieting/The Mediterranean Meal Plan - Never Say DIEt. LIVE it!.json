(Click Full Details to help find a solution.) <br><br></em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">My Health Wasn't Always Great</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have battled all of these issues, and I was taking multiple meds for them, complete with all of the side affects.  Now, they are just a bad memory, all because I decided to simply change the way I eat. Since it worked for me, I want to share with you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">exactly</em> </strong>how I did it so you can see if it will work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Forget The Fad Diets - They Don't Work</strong><br><br> Are you looking for a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"Diet\"</strong> to help you lose weight fast or lose a huge amount of weight? This  course can help with weight loss, but it is not the primary goal. What I am teaching here is a sustainable <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Meal Plan</strong> to help you<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> lose and maintain weight</strong> <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">and</em> also <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">fight off the risk of health issues</strong>. This course primarily stresses nutrition and health, with  weight loss as the pleasant side effect!<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>    We will start out with the  concepts of the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mediterranean Diet</strong>, but more importantly, I'm going to show you how I used what I call the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mediterranean <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Meal Plan </em></strong>to get my weight under control and to wean myself off those nasty meds I was taking<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">.</em></strong>  I didn't just study this and decide to teach it, I started <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">LIVING </strong>it first, then decided to share it with you.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I Am Living Proof That It Works</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  In the past, I have had a history of health issues (<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">see the FREE preview of My Story</strong> in the curriculum below).  It started with Type 2 Diabetes which lead to weight gain.  The weight gain led to High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol.  In 2014, I had contracted an infection because my immune system was weakened by all these other factors. <br><br>  Long story short, I dodged the grim reaper, but I learned that I needed to be more conscious of my health. Today, after a LOT of effort, and thanks to the Mediterranean Meal Plan, my blood sugar is below the diabetic level, and my weight, blood pressure and cholesterol are all in the \"normal\" ranges.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">It Can Work For You, Too!</strong><br><br>Now, everyone is different, but for the most part I believe that everyone can find <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">some</em> benefit to following this plan.  I can't make any guarantees, unfortunately, and this <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">will</em> require dedication on your part that only you can guarantee, but if you adopt this plan and start living it like I do, it certainly can't hurt.<br><br> <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Since all Udemy courses come with a 30-Day Guarantee Of Satisfaction, you have nothing to lose by giving it a try!
