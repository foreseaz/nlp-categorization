Do you wish you could get your eating under control without trying so hard (and failing)? <b>This course will help you end the struggle once and for all. Learn to eat intuitively by tuning into your body's inner wisdom about what, when, and how to eat.</b> Whether you're new to intuitive eating, or you've read all about it but couldn't figure out how to make it work, this course is for you. </p><p>Each week you'll learn a new practice designed to get you in touch with your intuition and improve your relationship with food. After you've completed the practices, you'll learn how to create an ongoing intuitive eating practice and become your own intuitive eating coach!</p><p>In this course you will learn to:</p><ul><li>Tune into inner wisdom about what, when, and how to eat.</li><li>Eat in a way that is nourishing, enjoyable, and satisfying</li><li>Let go of unhelpful thoughts about food and eating.</li><li>Interpret food cravings.</li><li>Notice and act on hunger and fullness signals from the body.</li><li>Eat previously forbidden foods (cookies, ice cream, candy!) without losing control.</li><li>Be your own coach and continue to reconnect with your intuition.</li></ul><p>What this course is not: A review of the principles of intuitive eating. You can get that anywhere. What I am sharing with you is what I have learned from successfully coaching clients towards becoming intuitive eaters. Knowing is not the same as doing, and this course teaches you how to actually become an intuitive eater.</p><p>As an intuitive eater you will be able to trust your body to tell you what it needs. No more following diet rules, or trying to force yourself to eat healthy. If a food makes you feel unwell, it won't be appealing to you anymore. Intuitive eating also helps you identify and overcome the reasons you eat when you are not truly hungry.</p><p>In the introduction section, you'll learn how to use the course to become an intuitive eater. There are also optional lectures to introduce you to the Udemy platform and Intuitive Eating for those of you who are new to either. At the end of the section there is an Intuitive Eating resource list you can use to deepen your learning.</p><p>In the next section you will find the core intuitive eating practices that will transform you into an intuitive eater. In each lesson you will learn about the theory behind the practice and how to put it into action. You should expect to complete one practice each week, as each practice will prepare you for the next practice after it. </p><p>After you have completed the practice section, you're ready to move on to the “Building a Practice” section where I will teach you how to create an ongoing intuitive eating practice and become your own intuitive eating coach. This will ensure that intuitive eating becomes a way of life for you that will become effortless over time, leaving you room to enjoy eating and living without obsessing about food all the time.</p><p>Questions?
