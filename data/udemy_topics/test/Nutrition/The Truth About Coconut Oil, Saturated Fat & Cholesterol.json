Loads of information about coconut oil.

Though the whole thing started out in the United States back in the 1950s, its impact on the health of individuals and the economy of coconut oil producing nations are far and wide.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">Scientists, health professionals and people passionate about coconut oil</em> have been making commendable efforts over the decades to promote the healthful coconut oil while vindicating the historical false beliefs. This course <em style=\"\">consolidates</em> the information in one single place, with the sole purpose of understanding the ‘Truth’ about coconut oil. This course allows the students to learn the reasons, facts and evidence dispelling many of the widespread, almost universal beliefs against coconut oil.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This course is aimed solely at helping students understand the many reasons, evidence and information speaking against the historical false statements. The course is not designed to teach the health benefits of coconut oil, which will be the content of another upcoming course in the pipeline. Before anyone can appreciate the healthful aspects of coconut oil, one must understand the truth behind this amazing substance given to us by nature.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Outline</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Understanding Fats (Fats and oils, saturated and unsaturated fats, cis and trans fats, and triglycerides)</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Learn About Coconut Oil and Virgin Coconut Oil</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Dispelling False Statements Against Coconut Oil</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of fats.
