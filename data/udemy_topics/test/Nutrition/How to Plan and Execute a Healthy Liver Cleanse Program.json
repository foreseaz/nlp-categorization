Do you sometimes feel bloated or constipated?Maybe your skin just isn&#039;t as glowing and healthy as it used to be. Then it&#039;s time you consider a liver cleanse. Cleansing is either revered as a miracle cure or vilified as an unhealthy waste of time. The truth is somewhere in the middle and depends on how the program is designed.</p><p>I created this course to help you create your own personalized (and healthy) liver cleanse program. There are many unhealthy programs out there, such as the grapefruit cleanse or the Master Cleanse (14 days of nothing but lemon water with maple syrup and cayenne). The purpose of a cleanse is simply to give your body a break from all that we bombard it with on a daily basis. A cleanse is not about depriving yourself of necessary nutrients or punishing yourself for enjoying some extravagances in life. It is about taking time to do something to rejuvenate and support your body. Your liver, as well as your whole digestive system, works hard to keep you healthy…and they are really good at what they do. But taking the time to give them a break will help your body deal with a multitude of issues from skin ailments to fatigue.</p><p>Learning how to create your own healthy program allows you to customize it to your personal tastes. This will increase your success and help you feel the renewed vitality and health that comes when you allow your body a little vacation from dealing with all of the everyday toxins we come in contact with. I like to refer to it as giving your liver a little spa vacation! </p>",
