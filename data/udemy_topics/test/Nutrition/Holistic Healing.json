    "description": "<p>Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired? Learn how to take charge of your health and use natural remedies to heal from chronic illness, instead of just managing symptoms. Learn how to balance your hormones, lose weight, get rid of insomnia, and finally start enjoying life to the fullest!</p><p>This course will help you learn about some of the most common forms of natural healing that you can use for both chronic and acute illnesses.  Herbs and homeopathy have been used for thousands of years and are still commonly used around the world.  They became obsolete with the rise of new science in the beginning of the 1900s.  Mineral balancing is a newer form of natural healing because mineral depletion has become more common in the last few generations.  </p><p>Taking this course will introduce many remedies that you may have heard of but it will cover many that you probably have never seen before.  Natural healing is taking the Western world by storm now since millions of people are getting tired of being \"treated\" instead of \"cured\".  </p>",
