    "description": "  <p style=\"\">In this course, our Senior Professor, John Benson, from Indulge Wine School - the largest consumer wine education company in the U.S. - takes you on a journey that starts with the basics of wine tasting, from glassware to tasting steps. Then, he&#039;ll taste you through six of the most popular wine varietals - Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah, and Cabernet Sauvignon. During the tastings, you&#039;ll learn about the key characteristics of the grape varietal, some wine history, key growing regions, the specific winery and wine he&#039;ll be tasting you on, and much more!&nbsp;<br style=\"\">  <br style=\"\">   We&#039;re the ONLY wine course in the WORLD where you can taste the exact wines that you&#039;re learning about. Just go to our Web site at http://www.indulgewineschool.com/classes/video-classes and order a tasting kit that contains the exact six wines that John is tasting on the video! Taking an online or DVD wine course is great, but it&#039;s truly amazing when you See, Swirl, Smell, Sip and Savor the wines along with our instructor (yup, we&#039;re the only ones that do that)!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    <p style=\"\">Buy a tasting kit for you and one for a friend and take the course together! You&#039;ll love it!</p>    <p style=\"\">The course also includes our 100+ page eTextbook, <em style=\"\">Wine 101: A Fun and Informative Introduction to the Wonderful World of Wine</em>. This textbook is a companion to the video course and provides wine information in a fun (and funny!) style that you&#039;ll enjoy reading. You will also get our Top 10 Wine Buying Tips Sheet (will pay for the course the first time you use it!) that covers tips for getting the best deals on wine in restaurants and retail stores. You also get our Food and Wine Pairing Chart, which makes pairing wine with food EASY! Lastly, you&#039;ll get our Wine Tasting Notes sheet, that you can use as a guide as you taste wines generally, or specifically to taste along with John and the six great wines he&#039;ll be presenting.</p>  ",
