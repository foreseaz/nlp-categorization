Susan is obviously very experienced with using a food dehydrator and I enjoy watching how she shares all the tricks she&#039;s learned over the years. Tips on everything from the use of oxygen bags to how to rehydrate foods to specific temperature settings for different fruits, vegetables and meats. The real benefit for me is that I&#039;m currently a casual food dehydrator (already own a Nesco) and now that I&#039;m more confident in my preparation techniques I can move towards making dehydrated foods a larger portion of my food supply.</p><p style=\"\">_____</p><p style=\"\">by Mrs Amanda Bennetts<br style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Wow I feel like an expert now</strong></p><p style=\"\">I knew nothing about dehydrating food before &amp; now, after doing this course I feel like an expert :) Thanks Susan, it was lots of fun learning about all the different aspects &amp; I really enjoyed your enthusiasm for every element.
