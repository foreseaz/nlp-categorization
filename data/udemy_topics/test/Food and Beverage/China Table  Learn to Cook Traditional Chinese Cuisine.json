    "description": "<p>Do you love Chinese food?</p>  <p>Most of us do, that’s why Chinese restaurants have been such a huge success - that and the fact that most people who are not Chinese have no idea how to cook it. </p>  <p>If you want to have a lot of fun while learning a new skill, why not learn how to cook your favorite Chinese food at home? Imagine being able to prepare all those delicious recipes: Kung Pao Chicken, Tea Eggs, Cha Siu (Roast Pork), my favorite thing in the world – Chicken Fried Rice, and many more. </p>  <p>Well, now you can learn all that and practice it in the comfort of your own kitchen. Welcome to China Table: Learn to Cook Traditional Chinese Food Video Course, where I, Jon Chu, will take you through everything you need to know about how to prepare amazing Chinese food fast and easy. Signing up for this fun, useful course means: </p>  <ul><li>Learning the simple rules of Chinese cuisine and how to apply them, step by step</li><li>Learning the different styles of Chinese cooking - it's not all stir fry in a wok!</li><li>Learning the real-life experience of how the meals are cooked. No show-style cooking, no complicated ingredients. Just real food. </li></ul>      <p>I decided to create that course partly because I got sick and tired of having to cook Chinese food for all my friends, all the time (because none of them could), but mostly because I love Chinese food and I know many people do. So I want to help bring it closer to your everyday life and make it an option when you’re wondering what to make for dinner, for get-togethers, and parties!</p>  <p>I’ve been cooking Chinese food for over 10 years now and I’ve mastered every bit of the process – and I know you can too. </p>",
