    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Have you ever wanted to know how to taste chocolate? What is the proper etiquette for tasting chocolate and can you really get to appreciate this luxury item before it disappears in your mouth and you are left scratching your head like an idiot, staring at an empty box of chocolates, wondering what the heck just happened?!?</span>  </p>  <p>  \tWell, this course is for you. I have made it to be fun and interactive. You are going to tell us everything that is going on inside your mouth as you place the first piece on your precious tongue. These are your first steps to becoming a Chocolate Connoisseur! You will learn not only How to Taste Chocolate but you will also begin developing your tasting vocabulary, which is sure to impress anyone who doesn’t feel confident stringing a sentence together.  </p>  <p>  \tI have included free tasting wheels and sheets for you to download and help you along your tasting journey. After this course you will be able to host your very own Chocolate Tasting Party. (even if it&#039;s a party of one!) If a party of one sounds too isolated for you and you can’t seem to gather enough friends to join you for at your chocolate tasting party, then we have also got you covered! This course has been designed to be interactive, we want to know all about what you are tasting and experiencing so share your tasting notes with the rest of the other students on this course and you might make a few new friends on here.  </p>  <p>  \tThe course (or should I say online chocolate party?) will take about an hour to complete with easy to follow video instructions and downloadable templates. Honestly, it really is that simple.  </p>  <p>  \tSo having said all of that, what are you waiting for? Come and join the party or forever be lost in chocolate translation.  </p>",
