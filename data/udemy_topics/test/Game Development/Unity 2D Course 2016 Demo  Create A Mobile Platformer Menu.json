    "description": "<p><strong>*** Created with Unity 5.3+ in April 2016 ***</strong></p>\n\n<p>Are you facing problems with 2d development in Unity 5? Are you looking for a simple and easy to understand course which shows you how to build a simple menu for your mobile platformer game?  Do the terms sprites and sprite sheets confuse you? Are you baffled by the process of building mobile games which look good on different screens and resolutions? If you answered yes to any of these questions then i have good news! Take this course and see for yourself that all of this is actually easy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago i was just like you, having problems with creating 2d stuff in Unity and looking for tutorials on YouTube, trying to get my head around seemingly hard concepts. None could help me get to a level where i could just start making 2d games with minimum effort. Sprite sheets, Sprite Editor, Canvas, Buttons, C# Scripting, Game Menus all seemed a bit out of reach. But i persisted. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's been 4 years since and it's all easy now. I've built numerous mobile games for clients as well as my own projects. I realized that this stuff was not difficult but there was not much documentation or ample video tutorials to explain things in an easy to understand manner. Right then i decided i will make an effort and share what i'd learned with others and the idea of AbleGamesDev was born. Waste no time and join this course and see for yourself. I'll see you inside!</p>",
