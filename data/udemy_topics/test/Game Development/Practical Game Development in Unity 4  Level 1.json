We will be creating a Missile Commander clone; which allows us to explore many of the techniques we can employ in our own projects: such as collision detection, asset management, level management, basic GUI implementation, particle effects and more!  </p>  <p>  \tThe purpose of this series is to lead by example; and as a result, everything we discuss will be put to immediate use in the form of completing our game.  </p>",
