    "description": "<p>In the first section of videos, you'll learn how to find connected controllers, define which buttons do what, set player indexes (i.e. Player 1, Player 2, etc) and work with a basic character.</p><p>In section 2,  you'll learn the Swift 2 / Sprite Kit code to work with multiple Extended / Standard Gamepad controllers (as well as the Micro Gamepad controller), to go head to head versus players in the same room. After we look at the finer points of connecting and disconnecting controllers and getting each in the right player slot, we'll discuss how to control who is who in any type game, and even go into a one-player mode where the CPU takes control of the second player. This way your two-player game can also be enjoyed by single players. We'll also discuss adding a Pause menu to your game, where players can go back to a Main menu or keep on playing.<span></span></p><p><span>Now that we've covered all our bases in terms of controlling each player and dealing with controllers disconnecting and reconnecting, section 3 allows us to have some fun. This session we'll loosen things up a bit and just talk game play. Topics include collision detection, decrementing health, losing lives / restarting rounds, and other topics worthy of a good two-player game!<span><br></span></span></p>",
