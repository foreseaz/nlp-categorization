    "description": "<p>In this course, Emiel Sleegers will go over on how to make a terrain using both Mudbox and World Machine. First, he will start by creating a base plane in Maya and then sculpting the terrain in Mudbox. From there,we will go ahead and export it into world machine where we will add more detail to the terrain, as well as use Photoshop to generate the texture we plan on using, and once that is complete, we will export and setup our terrain for game engines such as Unity3d, Cryengine3, and Unreal Engine 4.</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p>More about the Instructor:</p><p>Emiel Sleegers is a self-taught 3d artist currently residing in the Netherlands.
