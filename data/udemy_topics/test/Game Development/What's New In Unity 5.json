You'll learn what they are, how they work and how you can use them to create professional quality games with Unity 3D.</p><p style=\"\">Unity 5.0 is the biggest and boldest release ever. Powerful new features in Unity 5 include:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>The Physically-based Standard Shader to make your materials look consistent in any lighting environment, cross platform.</li><li>Real-time Global Illumination, built on Geomerics Enlighten technology.</li><li>The Audio Mixer, to massively improve audio in your game.</li><li>HDR Reflection Probes to enhance visual fidelity.</li><li>PhysX 3.3 to bring massive performance improvements to 3D physics.</li><li>Major updates to the animation system.</li><li>WebGL preview.</li></ul><p style=\"\">And of course, many more new features and updates. Keep reading to learn more.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">UNITY 5 NEW FEATURES</strong></p><strong style=\"\">AI</strong><ul style=\"\"><li>NavMesh supports LoadLevelAdditive</li><li>Improved performance and reduced memory consumption:<ul style=\"\"><li>NavMeshObstacles update is multi-threaded now. Carving speed generally improved 2-4x.</li><li>NavMesh data for non-carved regions takes ~2x less memory now.</li><li>Performance improvements for multi-threaded NavMeshAgent updates.</li><li>HeightMeshes bake faster, work faster at runtime, and use ~35% less memory.</li><li>Path replanning in presence of many carving obstacles is faster and more accurate.</li></ul></li><li>Improved inspectors and debug visualizations:<ul style=\"\"><li>NavMesh Areas inspector (previously NavMesh Layers) got a facelift.</li><li>Reorganized parameters NavMeshAgent inspector.</li><li>Added carve hull debug visualisation for NavMeshObstacles.</li><li>Added visualisation on how NavMesh bake settings relate to each other.</li></ul></li></ul><ul style=\"\"><li>Improved accuracy and raised limits:<ul style=\"\"><li>NavMeshObstacle supports two basic shapes - cylinder and box for both carving and avoidance.</li><li>Improved automatic Off-Mesh Link collision detection accuracy. Note that this will change how off-mesh links placement on existing scenes.</li><li>Improved navmesh point location/mapping when height mesh is used.</li><li>Increased the height range of NavMesh baking (can build meshes for taller scenes).</li><li>Made Height Mesh query more resilient to small holes in input geometry.</li><li>NavMesh obstacle rotation is take into account when carving and avoiding.</li><li>NavMesh tile count limit lifted from 216 to 228.</li><li>NavMeshPath and NavMeshAgent paths removed 256 polygon limit.</li><li>OffMeshLink - removed restriction on tile span - previously connected only up to neighbouring tiles.</li></ul></li></ul><strong style=\"\">ANDROID</strong><ul style=\"\"><li>KitKat Immersive Fullscreen Mode.
