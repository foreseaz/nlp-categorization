    "description": "<p>This is the right course for who is seeking <strong>great quality knowledge</strong> covering from the most basic aspects of game development up to Unity's most useful functionalities in terms of coding! Maybe you're a designer trying to understand the coding aspect, maybe you're just a student that wants to go deeper into game development, it doesn't matter. I come from a game design background and now I'm a scripting expert so <strong>you can do it too!</strong><br></p>  <p>  \t                                  In this course you can really expect <strong>code made easy.</strong> Don't fool yourself thinking that no hard work is necessary, though. As well as anything else, learning how to code is not something that happens overnight, so be sure to put a generous amount of effort onto completing quizzes and following the lectures correctly.</p><p>The course includes all sorts of files and materials used throughout, so you can be sure that everything you're learning in the lectures is totally reproducible in your computer without need to worry!</p>  <p>  \t                                  This course covers from the basics of interface up to the getting in deep touch with Unity's API, that is, the set of functions that make us able to code our own stuff inside the game engine, but don't expect to dive right into coding and all of that complicated stuff (not really). I've structured this course in such a way that you will <strong>learn</strong> everything <strong>without rush</strong>, so take your time. No prior knowledge is necessary for each lecture other than what you've learned in the previous one!  </p>  <p>  \t      Having a hard time understanding something? It's like they say: <strong>a picture is worth a thousand words</strong>. That's why some of the course lectures have <strong>blackboard sessions</strong>, where I grab some pen and paper (digitally) to clear up your mind with hand-made sketches!  </p>  <p>  \t                                  I have to say that <strong>this is the best Unity course out there</strong> given its price and how much of Unity it covers.  You can expect a dedicated lecturer with quite a lot of prior teaching experience, and trust me when I say: <strong>I speak your language</strong>! Shall we begin?</p>",
