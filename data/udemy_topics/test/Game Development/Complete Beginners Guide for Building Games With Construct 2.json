    "description": "<p>In this course, you will learn how to use Construct 2 through a hands-on program where we walk students through three unique video games. You will learn all about the Construct 2 platform, the basics of creating a video game, and a complete walk-through of three video games.</p>\n\n<p>Leveraging exclusively video, students can take this course at their own pace and follow along with the free version of Construct 2. The entire course will take about six hours to complete.</p>\n\n<p>We developed this course specifically for elementary through high school students, with a focus on our in-person Gaming Bootcamp program that we run in Sioux Falls, SD.</p><em><strong>Even if you have ZERO experience with Construct 2 or making video games, this course would be an excellent way to learn the basics and learn to love programing. This is a very entry-level course.</strong></em><br>",
