This isn't an explanation of what each menu does one by one (that's boring), but a high level explanation of how Unity functions from the perspective of a first time game developer. You'll then take that knowledge and build your first real game in about an hour.  </p>  <p>  \t You will learn basic scripting as it relates to game design. <strong style=\"\">No prior coding experience is necessary</strong> to take this course and create real games.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Game Developers</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t For those with experience in the world of game development, you can skip the basic Unity and basic scripting sections and move right into the higher level game development exercises. We understand you already know the basics and you want to increase your skills as a game developer.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">What You Will Learn</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>The Unity user interface</li>  \t<li>Structure of Unity projects</li>  \t<li>Basic Unity scripting</li>  \t<li>Intermediate and advanced Unity scripting</li>  \t<li>Working with assets</li>  \t<li>Level design</li>  \t<li>Sound design</li>  \t<li>Animation, modeling and rigging</li>  \t<li>Compiling games to console and mobile devices</li>  \t<li>Mecanim animation system</li>  \t<li>Shuriken particle system</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t This course uses C# as its programming language.
