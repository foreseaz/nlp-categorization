    "description": "<p>  \t    If you are selling your photos to microstcok agencies (Shutterstock, Fotolia, Dreamstime, just to name a few) then you already know the story. If you’re planning to enter this market and start selling your photos, then you’ll learn the story very soon.  </p>  <p>  \t    You need a lot of time and dedication to choose your pictures, prepare them at their best, choose the right keywords; you also need a lot of time to upload your pictures to each agency you work with.  </p>  <p>  \t    While you can’t save much time on preparation (and better don’t), you can save a lot of time when uploading if you do the right steps.  </p>  <p>  \t    This course teaches you how to use Easy Stock to upload your images to one or many different agencies with just a few clicks; with the right steps you can dramatically reduced the time dedicated to uploading and focus on image shooting, selection and preparation.  </p>  <p>  \t    Either you know it or you’re going to learn it: image uploading is a bottleneck and time dedicated to this activity has no added value. You just do it because you have to do it.  </p>  <p>  \t    Now, by following this course you’ll be able to drastically reduce the time you dedicate to it.  </p>  <p>  \t    I decided to create this course because I found myself starting to sell photos on microstock agencies and I started to feel that I was dedicating too much time to the upload process on different web sites rather than focusing on image preparation and refinement.  </p>",
