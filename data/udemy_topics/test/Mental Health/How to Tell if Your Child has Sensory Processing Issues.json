A basic background on occupational therapy, sensory processing function and dysfunction and everyday examples of everyday behaviours often seen in sensory processing disorder. The course should take approximately 1 hour to complete and will be supplemented with suggested readings and case examples. If you are looking for more information about SPD and the signs often associated with it-this is the course for you. I am a parent, occupational therapist, assistant professor and sensory trained assessor- I want you to know what to look for so that you can seek the help you need at the right time.</p>",
