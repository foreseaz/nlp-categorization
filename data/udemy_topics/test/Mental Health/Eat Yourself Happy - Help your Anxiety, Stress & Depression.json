I will discuss ways to make changes in diet easier and give plenty of information to enable you to look further into the relationship between diet and health.  </p>  <p>  \t      This course is packed with information covering two main areas, what you should eat (vitamins and minerals, fruit and vegetables etc) and what you shouldn&#039;t eat (sugar, caffeine etc). It summarises the research and gives guidance for making changes in your diet. As well as the videos, this course includes a transcript and many references for further research.  </p>",
