Good job. This guy clearly knows what he's talking about. I was going to give it 4.5 stars for being too short -- but I thought that didn't make sense since what is there is excellent.... Just what I've been looking for.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Great Mentor, and also the good method of teaching. I am a 16+ kid from India and I was looking for the way that could help me get some basic awareness about starting a business and the responsibilities of an entrepreneur. Got some extra info regarding marketings and steps to follow to reach out the correct audience. What to do and what not and even got to know more about the personal point of views from a bunch of successful persons. Overall: A quick course and very helpful for getting the rough ideas and guideline for becoming an entrepreneur.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Good information and very motivational. Once I started I couldn't stop till I watched all of them.\"</p>",
