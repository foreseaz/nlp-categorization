    "description": "<p>If you work at a clinic, hospital, independent practice or long-term-care facility, a percentage of the seniors currently in your care are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, whether or not they have felt safe enough to tell you about it. The common health issues faced by all older people are compounded for LGBT seniors, for whom the legacy of secrecy, social isolation and discrimination can gravely impact their physical and mental health.<strong> I</strong><strong>n this course we assume the viewer knows nothing (although we know you each know SOME things) as that is the best way to teach this subject to all.</strong> </p><p>When LGBT seniors get the message that they are safe and welcome, they are more likely to access care, disclose relevant health and home information, and achieve more positive health outcomes. This course provides practical steps for both licensed and non-licensed professionals to better understand the needs of LGBT seniors, to practice more effective communication and to create a clinical environment that communicates a sense of safety and welcome.</p><p>The course includes four video segments (totaling 44 minutes) that covers LGBT history, first-hand stories from LGBT seniors, an overview of common health issues, terminology, communication strategies, dramatic scenes that demonstrate good communication, and a series of patient care best practices. </p>",
