    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t          This is a class created by someone who has suffered from moderate to severe anxiety and clinical depression for decades. Based on this experience, 20 years of therapy and 20 years of finding what works and what I needed from others but never got, I created this curriculum. Somehow, I survived the depths of total despair and loneliness. Here, I tell my story and what you can do to help others and yourself. I show you what you need to ask for from others so you can cope,  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        I also draw from the 25 years of experience I had teaching special education where many of the issues are the same. I have tried my strategies in the real world.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         The course goes over things others can do to support and help all people involved in the life of someone with this mental illness.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This course includes a substantial list of resources underscoring main concepts.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t THis course can be completed in about 3 days.  </p>",
