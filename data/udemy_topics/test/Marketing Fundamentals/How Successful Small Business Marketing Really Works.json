And yet, for most small business owners, Marketing is a mystery and Sales is a dirty word.  </p>  <p>  \t In this short course, excerpted from his mega-course <strong style=\"\">How To Build A Customer Factory</strong>, Frank Felker explains how successful small businesses turn complete strangers into Customers and Customers into Clients the same way we attract members of the opposite sex - through courtship.  </p>  <p>  \t But unlike the awkward experience of asking someone for a date, today&#039;s digital marketing tools allow you to break the ice from afar, nurture the relationship and close the deal systematically without embarrassment, rejection or that smarmy feeling of being too &quot;salesy.&quot;  </p>  <p>  \t Drawn from his 40+ years in the trenches observing and implementing successful Marketing and Sales techniques, this course gets right to the heart of Frank&#039;s approach to business development.  </p>",
