I was able to give my clients the formula for establishing their hourly rate but including the 'adding value' element was missing. Debbie's course 'How to Design a Signature Program' was exactly what I needed to solve this problem. Further, I tested this myself, after finishing the course. <em>I followed Debbie's 5 step process for a new proposal which was accepted promptly, without question or negotiation. </em>I highly recommend Debbie's easy step-by-step model for pricing, which in my opinion, can be applied to anyone offering a service and not only for coaches, consultants and mentors. ~ </em><em>Fran Piggott CEO, Marketing Guru, South Africa</em></p><p><em>__________________________________________________________________________</em></p><p> Like you, when I started my own business as an independent marketing consultant back in 1998, I too sold my time by the hour, or by the month. </p><p>Then I remembered that when I worked in the advertising agencies we sold by the project. We presented prospects with a specific scope of work and the results we would deliver, and we quoted them a project fee or a monthly retainer to cover that scope of work. </p><p><strong>That's when I realized I needed to sell my services the same way.</strong></p><p>I didn't want my clients buying my time. After all, who's to say what your time is worth. It's rather arbitrary. And high hourly fees can actually turn prospects away if they don't think you're worth it.</p><p><strong>It's much better to sell results.</strong></p><p>That way clients are buying what they want. They're paying for you to solve their problems.</p><p>You decide how long it takes to get that outcome and you charge them based on what that outcome is worth.</p><p>It has nothing to do with what your time is worth.</p><p><strong>When you learn to package your services it changes your entire business.</strong></p><p>(1)<strong> It helps you attract more of the right clients</strong>—the clients who are searching for exactly the outcome you deliver.</p><p>(2) <strong>It eliminates clients negotiating down the price or the term</strong> because you can easily tell them, this is what it takes to get the results you want.</p><p>(3) <strong>It enables you to charge for the value you're delivering</strong>, which is usually more than what you or a client might determine your time is worth.</p><p>(4) And, <strong>it enables you to sell more confidently</strong> because it eliminates any doubt that you're “worth it.\" It's not about you. It's about the outcome your clients want and will get when they work with you.</p><p><em>So, if you're an existing coach or consultant who is still selling your time, or you're a brand new coach or consultant who is trying to figure out how to package your services and what to charge, this course is for you.</em></p><p><strong>This course is ideal for independent coaches or consultants who...</strong></p><ul><li>Are currently selling their time by the hour, or term (e.g. 3 month package)</li><li>Are brand new in business and aren't sure how to package their services</li><li>Would like to make it easier to sell their services</li><li>Are tired of prospective clients negotiating down price or term</li><li>Aren't comfortable selling because they don't know what their time is worth</li><li>Aren't getting enough of the right clients</li><li>Are creating time-consuming spec proposals for every single prospect</li><li>Are having to re-invent the wheel with each new client</li><li>Would love to be able to promise specific outcomes to their clients</li><li>Would like to create more efficiency in their business</li><li>Are interested in creating leveraged programs (e.g. online courses, books) in the future</li><li>Would like to know how many clients they need to make the money they desire</li><li>Want to be sure they can reach their income goals without working more hours than they want</li><li>Would like reliable, predictable cash flow (instead of being on a cash flow roller coaster!)</li><li>Want to be sure their business is viable, profitable, and enjoyable</li></ul><p><strong>Don't waste another day trying to sell your time.</strong></p><p>This course will take you <strong>step-by-step</strong> through the exact same process I've been using successfully myself, and with my private consulting clients, for years. </p><p><strong>This course includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Instructional Video Lessons for each step of the process</li><li>Fill-in-the-blank Worksheets so you can create a profitable Signature Program </li><li>Examples for all exercises for your review and reference</li><li>Step-by-Step Instructions so you can easily apply what you're learning to your business</li></ul><p><strong>Design a Signature Program...</strong></p><ul><li>You can become known for</li><li>That will set you apart from the competition</li><li>You can sell confidently</li><li>You know will deliver the results your ideal clients want</li><li>That will make your business profitable, enjoyable, and successful</li></ul><p><strong>Check out the Introduction and the First Lesson, they're free! </strong></p><p>Then enroll today so you can get started creating your very own Signature Program.</p><p><strong>****************************************************************************</strong></p><p><strong>If you're already enrolled in my course, <em>How to Market Yourself as a Coach or Consultant</em>...</strong></p><p>... and you're wondering if you should enroll in this course, here are a few things to think about:</p><p>1) This course features separate video lessons for EACH of the 5 steps in both my Signature Program and Financial Viability processes. If you've struggled with these processes and you want more in-depth instruction and explanation, this course provides that.</p><p>2) If you prefer focusing your learning on bite-sized topics, this course does just that. This is one of the most important topics I teach because it's what enables you to get out there and offer your services in the way your ideal clients are most likely to buy.</p><p>3) If you haven't yet gotten to the Signature Program and Financial Viability sections, this course may help you get these important steps done so you can get out there and start selling your services, while you're still learning and applying the rest of the marketing steps.</p><p>4) If you've completed my <em>How to Market Yourself</em> course and you're still struggling to package, market and sell your services, this course may just provide the additional know-how, inspiration, and motivation you need to get on track.</p>",
