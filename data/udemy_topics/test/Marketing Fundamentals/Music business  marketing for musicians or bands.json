    "description": "<p>  \t This is a course for aspiring musicians and artists. The course will teach you how to correctly promote your work on social media and other online marketing strategies.  </p>  <p>  \t The course is a mixture of an interview with a musician named Sarantos who is successfully using social media to promote his music, and tutorials from me on some of the common marketing and business practices that musicians and artists should be aware of.  </p>  <p>  \t The course is nearly all video, which is the preferred format of Udemy courses.</p>  <p>  \t <strong>What To Expect From The Course</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t Don't expect to become a star overnight. The course notes many good practices, and has a number of examples and suggestions for the right ways to do things. But it will be up to you to try things out and correctly implement the strategies discussed in the course.  </p>  <p>  \t Best of luck!  </p>",
