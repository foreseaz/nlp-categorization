    "description": "<p>I've seen a lot of courses on conversion. But not one of them taught me anything that I needed. I decided to do a course with <strong>step by step</strong> practical guidance on how to make a landing page with high conversion. I invested <strong>many years</strong> of experience as well as information that is not publicly available. The course starts with the basic concepts of marketing, and in the end you have a great opportunity to see the result. I did not want to make a long course, because we live in a world where <strong>time is money</strong>. So I did my best to pick out just the right information for you based on <strong>pedagogical methods</strong>. It is a valuable lesson in a course on the <strong>fatal errors</strong> about landing pages, this information is exclusive and mined empirically using tests. <strong>99%</strong> of developers and marketers will find this knowledge useful. Thereâ€™re no other courses similar to this one. <strong>Happy exploring!</strong><strong></strong><em><strong></strong></em></p>",
