I&#039;ll share with you tips and tricks I&#039;ve learned to sell thousands of sponsorships and earn my company and clients millions of dollars to fund their meetings, events and nonprofits.</p><p>I&#039;ve learned the hard way over 20+ years, selling thousands of sponsorships.   I&#039;ve condensed all my wisdom into this course. You&#039;ll learn the basics, plus WAY more! </p><p>Most sponsorship campaigns have limited potential because they haven&#039;t taken a thorough assessment of their sellable assets, and they don&#039;t know the four secret motivations of sponsors. I&#039;ll show you how to do both, and how to use that knowledge to craft a sponsorship prospectus that practically sells itself. I&#039;ll walk you through some excellent sponsorship prospectus examples and show you how they were built, and why they include what they include.</p><p>Lastly, if you&#039;re not a born salesperson, I&#039;ll also share with you what I&#039;ve learned over the years to make the sales process REALLY easy. </p><p>Your investment in my course will surely pay for itself in time saved, hardships avoided, and sales closed!</p>",
