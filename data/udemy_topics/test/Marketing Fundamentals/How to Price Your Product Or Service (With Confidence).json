    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   Many entrepreneurs and small business owners are victims of an odd common practice: to price their products and services passively, using little more than raw intuition without careful consideration.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Establishing prices without thoughtful diligence can lead to dire consequences for small business owners whether they price their offers too low (leaving money on the table and not making healthy profits as a result) or too high (turning potential customers away and restricting their market share).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   This course has the primary goal of helping you find the right price and also (perhaps more importantly) establish pricing policies that will lead to <strong style=\"\">lasting</strong> success. Note the emphasis on the word &quot;lasting&quot;: our focus are on strategies that will help you build a connection with your customers, which will in turn lead to long-term, and not just immediate, profitability. Many pricing strategies focus on short-term gains that could potentially lead to fast cash but at the high cost of sacrificing return business - which is not in our interest.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In this course we will offer a great deal of proven strategies, tools, and information that will help you get started right away in establishing your pricing policies and finding the right price(s) for your offer(s).  </p>",
