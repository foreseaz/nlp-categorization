So You Can Create the Business and Life You’ve Been Dreaming Of!</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your business is not where you'd like it to be, or you're ready for a change and you want to create a road map to help you get wherever you'd like to go, this course is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever kind of business YOU'D like to have... I'd like to share with you a simple process you can use to get fiercely focused so you can create it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Not only will it help you make decisions every day about what you need to DO to get there, it will also set things up so the Universe can support you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'm not going to get all woo-woo on you, but I will tell you when you get crystal clear on what you want, it changes EVERYTHING.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And it ups-the-odds that you will actually get there... or perhaps get someplace even better!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This process is simple, you can complete it in an afternoon, and on a couple sheets of paper.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I'm going to give you... </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A fill-in-the-blank template <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">(to make it easy to create your plan)</em></li><li>Examples from 3 different Strategic Plans <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">(so you know what goes in each section)</em></li><li>A Sample Strategic Plan <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">(so you know what a completed plan looks like)</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>And I will walk you through a very simple 6-step process<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> (so you can easily create your plan)</em><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You may be thinking, “A Strategic Plan… that sounds complicated… isn’t that something corporations do… do I really need one if it’s just me?”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I’m not going to teach you how to do a traditional corporate Strategic Plan. You’re right, you don’t need THAT!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I used to develop those plans when I worked in the corporate and non-profit sectors. They’re a ton of work, they’re pages and pages long, and they are NOT what you need as an independent coach or consultant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What I WILL teach you is a scaled down version that only includes the parts you need to get focused and clear about the type of business and life you want to create.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What Students Are Saying About This Course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Once again Debbie has delivered. My strategic plan did take less than a day to do. Through her direction, I now have focus on where I want my life to go and how to get there.<br>My strategic plan is concise, realistic, achievable and not overwhelming to accomplish.<br>Thanks Debbie<br>~Fran Piggott</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>Really helpful course Debbie. I haven't considered using intentions instead of goals before and I liked how simplified your process for writing our mission and vision statements was.<br>Thanks!<br>~Helen Bolger-Harris</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
