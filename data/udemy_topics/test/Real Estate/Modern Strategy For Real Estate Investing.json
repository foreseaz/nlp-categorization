No credit scores, No Mortgages, No massive down payment.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hey, thanks for stopping to look at my course. It means a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you that don't know me I'm a real estate investor, entrepreneur and mentor. A few years back I was running a rapidly failing business. I sold everything I had to try and pay the bills but there was never enough money, so I ended up homeless living in the backroom of my office. 70sq ft of windowless depression.</p>\n\n<p>After spending a few months feeling sorry for myself I began researching what the wealthy knew that I didn't, how other people were successful when all I seemed to do was fail. </p>\n\n<p>Within 12 months of making the decision to study what the wealthy knew that I didn't, I owned a real estate portfolio worth over $2,000,000. My life was changed.</p>\n\n<p>Since then I have been featured in Business Insider, MSN Money, Elite business and many more high profile magazines and I am author of the International No.1 Bestseller 'The Power of Real Estate Investing'.</p>\n\n<p>The strategy I teach in this course is one of the most exciting and modern 'no money down' real estate strategies. I share with with you everything I've used over the last few years to build a massive cash flowing business that I can run from anywhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear this is not a get rich quick scheme, it will take some work, commitment and perseverance. My results are not typical, you may do better, you may do worse, I don't know you. I do however believe in this strategy and I believe in you.</p>",
