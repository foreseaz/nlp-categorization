There are two things wrong with this type of thinking. First, you are not “bothering” the real estate agent. Real estate agents are standing by wanting nothing more than to help you purchase a property. Secondly, although you can get a great deal of information from the Internet, real estate is extremely local and by working with an agent early on in the process you can actually save yourself time and aggravation. </p><p style=\"\">Whether you are seriously looking to buy a property or simply testing the waters, it&#039;s a good idea to contact a real estate agent. They can walk you through the home buying process step-by-step so you know how this all works and what you can expect.</p><p style=\"\">A good real estate agent will put you in contact with a reputable lender that can assess your buying power BEFORE you start looking at properties. The last thing you want to do is to look at houses, fall in love with one only to find out that you can&#039;t afford it.</p><p style=\"\">Inside the What to Expect When Buying a House course, we give you a behind the scenes look at what it takes to buy a house and what you need to think about before and during the process.</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of where you live, buying a house is expensive. Don&#039;t you think it&#039;s important to understand what you should be doing and what questions you should be asking?</p><p style=\"\">The information in this course has been tested and proven to be effective for over a decade. I use this very same information to educate my buyer clients. This helps them understand the process, understand what is expected of them and helps them have a better home buying experience.</p><p style=\"\">If you are in the market to make a home purchase or simply thinking about making a purchase, the What to Expect When Buying a House course was designed for you.</p>",
