You don’t need any prior programming experience.</p><p>Learning to code is intimidating. There’s all that syntax, all those new words and unintuitive software to get your head around. It’s hard to know where to start.</p><p>Beginning App Development was lovingly crafted to be the fast track train that takes you to this new and exciting world.</p><p>Whether if you want a change of career or to make your first prototype App, this course is the perfect launch pad. <br></p><p>Don't take our word for it!</p><p><strong>Feedback on our online course:</strong></p><p>\"You have the best programming tutorial on developing IOS app\nThank You!﻿\" -  Guy Demmogyü <br></p><p>\"Great videos, best learning videos I have seen﻿<span>.\" - Keef Garr<br></span></p><p><span>\"I like the way you explain, easy to understand, make our life easier.<span>\" - Rio Lim<br></span></span></p><p><span><span>We're not your average online tutor.</span></span></p><p><span><span>We at the London App Brewery have spent years training people with no programming experience how to code and make apps in our London class room. Here we relaxed have small group lectures, one-to-one teaching and you even get beer at the end to reward your coding!</span></span></p><p><span><span>We've been running weekend crash courses for both iOS and Android Development for a long time, so we know all the questions you might have even before you can think of them. We've explained hard-to-understand programming concepts thousands of times, and we've figured out ways of explaining it to the visual, auditory and kinesthetic people. We've seen every variation of programming questions and we'll do our best to answer all of these in our course. </span></span></p><p><span><span>We want to teach the world to code but we don't have enough man power to meet you all and teach you in person. So that's why we are starting this online course, where we hope to be your companion on your app making journey. But we are more Yoda, less R2D2.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Feedback for our physical course:</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span>\"Like a lot of people I have an idea for an app every other day. I was very impressed by Philipp and Angela’s ability to understand, explain and resolve every single problem I ran into. It’s comforting to know you’re in safe hands when trying something new and technical.<span>\" - Michael Maiga, Entrepreneur.<br></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>\"I had a great time on the London App Brewery course and it was revelatory to me that I could make so much progress in such a short amount of time. That’s entirely down to the teaching standards, which are top notch. Strongly recommended to anyone who wants to build an app or just understand how they work.<span>\" - Aidan Russell, Accountant.<br></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>\"The London App Brewery teaches you how to code and design apps by walking you through the most influential apps in the market. I started with zero Java knowledge and at the end I found myself in “the zone” solving the “Challenge” (mock app development briefs). All my questions were answered and barriers to app development evaporated. This workshop will kick start you.<span>\" - James Leung, Product Manager.<br></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span><br></span></p>",
