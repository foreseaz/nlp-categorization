Our prime focus is to ensure learning is simple  and done step by step through easy to follow video sessions.  </p>  <p>  \t The full course spans over a total of over 20 hours of high quality  video training. All topics are easy to learn and presented in digestible  short 5 to 15 minute videos with real world examples, demos and  exercises - <em style=\"\">in addition to the live interactive support we are now offering.</em>  </p>  <p>  \t At the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of how mobile apps are written on the iPhone.  </p>  <p>  \t The course contains discussions, demos, and exercises to test your skill. All demos come with full source code.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">The course is divided into THREE main Parts (A, B, C)</strong> - each with  their respective Course Units. We&#039;ve also packaged a bonus course on  Objective - C programming if you need to brush up your Obj C skills.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Part A, is the foundation</strong> and will get you through majority of the main foundation learning topics.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t  We start the course with some of the important design patterns used when  developing in Objective - C for iPhones and iPads. We&#039;ll also look at  the structure of iOS itself and the application lifecycle.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t  You will then learn how to build and control user interfaces using views  and view controllers. Touch interactions are also covered.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t  Next, we teach the three view controller types that are important in any  iPhone app: tab bars, navigation controllers, and table views. Probably  80% of all iPhone apps rely on one or more of these controller types,  so this unit goes into great detail. There are six discussions and seven  demos (with code included) in this unit alone! <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t  Then we cover SQLite, a light-weight mobile database system used on both  Android and Apple mobile platforms. You&#039;ll review SQL syntax and learn  how to create databases and interact with them in your apps.  <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Parts B &amp; C</strong> of the course cover more advanced features, such  as - Threading, Audio and Video, 2D Graphics and Animation, SpriteKit  and OpenGL-ES. <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">*BONUS* - Learn Objective C Programming from The Ground Up</strong><br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t  If you need to brush up your Objective C skills, we&#039;re giving you a  BONUS course packaged at no extra cost. This Objective C course is  otherwise available as a stand alone course at a premium price.  </p>",
