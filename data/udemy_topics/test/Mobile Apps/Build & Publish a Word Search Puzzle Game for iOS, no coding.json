    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Thank you for your interest in this course, my name is Yohann, I will be your instructor.</span>  </p>  <p>  \tWith this course, you get the full source code of a classic word search game for iPhones and iPads. (iOS7 and iOS 8 beta ready, universal app)  </p>  <p>  \tThe gameplay is simple &amp; addictive. these are the main ingredients to make a successful game in the app store.  </p>  <p>  \tIn this course, I show you every single steps you need to start, and I’m assuming you know nothing or very little,and I’m gonna help you succeed having your very own game, published in the itunes app store, without having to write not even one single line of code!  </p>  <p>  \tSince this source code comes with advertising banners you not only get an education but you also have the potential to make passive incomes from it.  </p>  <p>  \tMany of my students that took my courses, just like this course, made it to the top iTunes charts and they are now making a living out of creating mobile games!  </p>  <p>  \tThis game source code costs hundreds of dollars on its own, and you’re getting it for free with this course. You can keep using this code and make dozens of games out of it. In the video lectures, I will create a word search puzzle with a halloween theme, but feel free to create your own, it could be anything you can imagine such as Christmas, Hanoukka, Kwanza, easter, any holidays or any topics you can think of. Your imagination has no limit!  </p>  <p>  \tThis is a perfect way to start your mobile app business and this is a must-have app for anyone wanting to increase their app portfolio.  </p>  <p>  \tMake the right decision and join us now. I’ll see you in the classroom.  </p>",
