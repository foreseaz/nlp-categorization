Reports have confirmed that Apple has manufactured and plans to sell over 15 million AppleWatch&#039;s in its initial launch in mid-April 2015.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">So, if you&#039;re making Mobile Apps - this is potentially a MASSIVE opportunity for you!</strong><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">As with all new technologies, <em style=\"\">those who move first</em> and adapt rapidly get the <strong style=\"\">early-mover advantage</strong>. Those who don&#039;t, are left behind trying to play the catch-up game.</p><p style=\"\">Fortunately and unfortunately, thats the reality of how technology evolves and works. Getting in early helps you get initial traction faster than late comers, and lets you dominate your app niches quickly.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">By learning Apple WatchKit development, you are literally opening up the doors to <strong style=\"\">massive opportunuities</strong> for you as a developer.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">And, because this really is &quot;new&quot; territory behind which <strong style=\"\">Apple is putting all its might and magic</strong> - the size of the opportunity stands to mushroom into unprecendented dimensions.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The questions you should be asking yourself are...</strong></p><hr style=\"\"><p style=\"\">- Am I bold and fast enough to seize this opportunity?<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">- Do I want to have a shot at making the next wildly successful Apple Watch App?</p><p style=\"\">- Do I want to share similar successes of the makers of FlappyBird, Angry Birds and the likes?</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The Apple WatchKit Framework and Development Environment</strong></p><hr style=\"\">Apple Watch gives developers an opportunity to interact with users in an entirely new way.<p style=\"\">Apple Watch development is fairly simple, thanks to the WatchKit Framework and the new version of Xcode.</p><p style=\"\">Adding a WatchKit extension to an existing app is a simple matter of adding a WatchKit target to the app. You may also create a new app and add a WatchKit extension immediately.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">A WatchKit App is organized into three parts</strong> <br style=\"\"></p><ul style=\"\"><li>the app that runs on iPhone distinct from the watch environment,</li><li>the WatchKit app itself, which exists only on the watch, and contains storyboards but no code,</li><li>the WatchKit extension, which runs on the iPhone and contains the controllers for the watch app. The extension also communicates between the phone app and the watch app.</li></ul><br style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">There are three types of things which may be displayed on the watch</strong>   <ul style=\"\"><li>A WatchKit application, which presents an interface to an iPhone app to the user</li><li>A Glance, which is a single simple screen of information presented to the user by the app.</li><li>Notifications, which can be sent to the user&#039;s watch from an app either in the foreground or background state.</li></ul><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">In our Apple WatchKit Essential Training course, we cover all three of these in great detail.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">How The Apple WatchKit is Different...</strong></p><hr style=\"\">Even though the watch app itself <strong style=\"\">runs no code</strong>, the watch contains a <em style=\"\">reasonably full set of hardware devices</em>, such as an <strong style=\"\">accelerometer</strong>, <strong style=\"\">gyro-meter</strong>, and a <strong style=\"\">heartbeat sensor</strong>.<p style=\"\"><br style=\"\">Data from these devices can be sent to the iPhone app that hosts the watch app and is processed. By combining this data with the phone&#039;s Wifi or GPS and other sensor data, a complete picture can be gained of the user&#039;s location, current activity level, compass direction, and more.</p><p style=\"\">Apple Watch also uses a completely new touch engine, which <strong style=\"\">senses the force of a user&#039;s touch</strong> as well as the fact that the user is just touching the screen.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">This might be used to develop code that handles a wider variety of touchscreen gestures, or brings up different information depending on now, not only where <strong style=\"\">but how the screen is touched</strong>.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">Of course, the screen the user is touching is a full retina display, which makes presenting high-quality interfaces in your apps a breeze.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What You Will Learn</strong><br style=\"\"></p><hr style=\"\">This course teaches <strong style=\"\">everything you need to develop compelling apps</strong> for Apple Watch using the <strong style=\"\">WatchKit framework</strong> and the <strong style=\"\">Swift programming language.</strong> <p style=\"\"><em style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></em></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">You will learn all of the following topics...</em><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Requirements and First Steps</strong> <strong style=\"\">-</strong> Adding a WatchKit target to an existing iPhone app. The WatchKit environment, and the function of the Extension and WatchKit app itself.

The context object and its role in communicating data. Getting input from the user. Communicating between the watch app and the iPhone app that hosts it. Table views on Apple Watch. We&#039;ll also discuss view groups as a way to manage the positioning of user interface controls.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Glances -</strong> A glance is a static view on the watch that gives an update to the user about something that&#039;s happening in a phone app. We&#039;ll learn all about glances in this unit. How to bring up a watch app when the user taps a glance.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Notifications</strong> <strong style=\"\">-</strong> We&#039;ll cover the difference between static and dynamic notifications and how to display both.
