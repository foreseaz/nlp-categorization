You start a few tutorials on the internet but you end up without an app or any&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>    <p>If you want to make apps you pretty much have to use Xcode, Apple&#039;s app making program. But when you download it and take a look it seems really complicated to use. There are tons of books on how to program and use Xcode but none of them are that user friendly.&nbsp;</p>    <p>This course is the easiest way to get an app onto the app store. You will learn how to make a small app and release it to the app store. You can add this to your resume. Think about it, your resume with a published app. Imagine all of the people who will not have that on their resume. You will be ahead of the game.&nbsp;</p>  ",
