You will learn, using SQLite the fundamental concepts of integrating a SQLite based database into iOS7 applications. We will get to iOS8 shortly.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                    The course spans over a total of over 80 minutes of high quality video training of 10 Lectures and Assignment.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Our prime focus is to ensure that learning is simple and is done step by step through easy to follow video sessions. All topics are easy to learn and presented in digestible short 5 to 15 minute videos with real world examples, demos and assignments. The course contains discussions, demos, and exercises to test your skill. All demos come with full source code that you can download and use for your projects.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                We will start with Plist which are the property list files that store serialized objects. Then we move on to in depth discussions on SQLite on the iOS7 platform. SQLite as you know is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Before you start, you should have some idea of the basics of programming in iOS platform. You will need a Mac OS X environment or a Virtual OS to get started. If you do not have one, you can Google it and get it up and running in about 30 minutes. This will help you with all your OS X development. We offer quick feedback and support via the Udemy discussion interface.  </p>",
