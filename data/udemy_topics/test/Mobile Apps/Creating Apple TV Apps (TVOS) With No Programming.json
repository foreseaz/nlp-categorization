    "description": "<p>Thousands of people have quick their lives and become their own boss by becoming an app developer. Unfortunately, with hundreds of thousands of apps on the Apple App store, it's no longer as easy as it used to be to get noticed. Great apps are missed everyday. The Apple TV is still brand new--a few thousand apps exist, but that's tiny when compared to other app stores. What that means is it's easier to get noticed.</p><p>If you are interested in app development and aren't sure where to stare, then this class is for you. It's a very beginners course. Best of all: there's absolute no coding at all! </p><p>Of course, if you want to create the next Angry Birds, you'll need to learn how to code; but you need to start somewhere, and this class is the perfect place.</p>",
