    "description": "<p>  \t        This course introduces you to Apple&#039;s brand new programming language; Swift. Swift enables you to build applications for iOS devices and for the Mac. It has been newly released to replace Objective-C.  </p>  <p>  \t        It is a new language which is aimed at getting more people writing applications for these platforms as it is more beginner friendly. You can write apps and games using Swift and using the new playgrounds feature in XCode 6 you can see the results of the code as you type.  </p>  <p>  \t        This course covers everything from registering as an Apple developer, downloading and installing Xcode and writing your first program using Swift.  </p>  <p>  \t        Whether you are a seasoned developer or a complete newcomer to coding you can dive in to the relevant section depending on your skill level. Swift is a great starting language for beginners and especially if you want to create an app but didn&#039;t know how!  </p>  <p>  \t      This is more than just a rehash of the swift programming language book, there are worked examples, an understanding of the quirks using xcode to design user interfaces and the building of a very simple app.  </p>  <p>  \t      Also content will be added to this course in the future so get involved now!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Update</strong>: Apple have just announced that all registered Apple developers can get access to XCode 6 and download it for FREE. So you can simply register (if you haven&#039;t already done so) and get XCode 6 and starting using Swift today!  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">And the unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee is not just any old guarantee, it&#039;s my personal promise to you that you will succeed ... just like my thousands of other Udemy students.</em>  </p>",
