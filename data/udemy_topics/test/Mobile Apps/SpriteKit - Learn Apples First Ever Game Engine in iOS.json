But since launch of iOS7 Apple has introduced their first ever game engine called SpriteKit. This will make creating 2D games more fun and easy. It is now one of the best ways to make games on iOS completely supported by Apple. It doesnâ€™t require additional libraries or additional dependencies.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            If you are familiar with iOS programming then learning SpriteKit would be a piece of cake.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            In this course our American Expert tutor will start with the basic of SpriteKit  who know exactly how to present the topics of SpritKit in a<em style=\"\">systematic step by step manner.</em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            The goal of this course it to train you to build 2D game applications including features for Animation, Particle Systems and a full Physics Engine.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            The course spans over a total of over 90 minutes of high quality video training of 11 Lectures with Assignments.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Our prime focus is to ensure learning is simple and done step by step through easy to follow video sessions.
