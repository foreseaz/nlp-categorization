We will start by using basic Ionic Components. While the course, you will learn how to use Angular [dot] js to build dynamic apps that update in real time. The course will also introduce you to Parse, an amazing Platform as a Service which allows users to store their app data on the cloud and lets the developer completely focus on their app instead of worrying about the server. We will learn how to store data on Parse and then manipulate it using our Ionic Application.</p><p>Finally, we will learn to deploy Ionic applications on real Android Devices.</p><p>The aim of this course is not to cover as much Ionic components as possible but to create an Application with as minimum components as we can so that user can easily use the application. We will make a dynamic app that updates its data in real time using Parse.</p><p>We will create a Friends List Android App that contains the list of friends which can be extended by adding new friends to the list, deleting friends or updating data for existing friends. This idea can be extended to build a cloud based contacts manager app. This app will your thought process rolling and you will start thinking in terms of Ionic Framework. </p><p>And once you have started, sky is the limit.</p>",
