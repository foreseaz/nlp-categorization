Available for freelance.</b></p><p>  \t   This is a 10 video-tutorial series that teaches developers with no iOS app development experience the core concepts for iOS app development. Using Xcode 5 and iOS SDK 7, you start with a simple Hello World video and work your way all the way up to interacting with a remote server.  </p>  <p>  \t   Each video focuses on a particular topic. The goal at the start of each video is very clear. The videos are very detailed, well-edited, and are very explicit.  </p>  <p>  \t   Tony Friz, the author of the series, has been a self-taught iOS developer for 5 years. He knows just about everything there is to know when it comes to writing iOS applications.  </p>  <p>  \t   All apps created in the videos are created for iOS 7 - you're getting the latest and greatest.  </p>",
