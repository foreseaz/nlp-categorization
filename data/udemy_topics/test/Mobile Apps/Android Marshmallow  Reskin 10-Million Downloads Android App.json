Everyday there are tons of mobile apps uploaded to either Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Not even mention about other alternative app stores. </p>\n\n<p>Hence, the competition can be very fierce if you are about to create an app from scratch. If you do not have any knowledge about programming, the app creation process may take months or even years to complete. </p>\n\n<p>Let us ask you a question. Will you create a wheel that is square in shape? We bet you not. It is ridiculous to re-invent the wheel and make it into another shape. </p>\n\n<p>Analogously, it is unwise to create an Android app from nothing, unless you already have some excellent programming knowledge. For sure, we are not saying that everyone should NOT learning programming language. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the truth. You may need to take months or years just to master those hard-to-understand programming knowledge. So, if you easily get overwhelmed by the programming language, then this course is definitely for you! We will teach you create an app without touching any line of codes!</p>\n\n<p>Look, this course can provide you a simpler picture of what Android development is all about. Are you ready to create your first Android app? Faster than others? </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Apps Reskinning]</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>Apps Reskinning is an alternative mobile app industry that you can penetrate. In laymen term, reskin an app means changing the graphics and musics of an app while maintaining its source code. In other words, we get a source code and alter some of the graphics and changing the music files. </p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will first learn how to install JDK (Java Development Kit), an important virtual machine that is needed to run Android Studio. Next, you will learn how to install Android Studio (the Official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android) and the Android SDK (Software Development Kit). </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Source Code]</strong></p>\n\n<p>The source code is included in this course. It has been downloaded more than 10,000,000 times on Google Play Store. Check out our first video. </p>\n\n<p><strong>[App Compilation Errors - Solved!]</strong></p>\n\n<p>As you all may know, any wrong steps in importing the source code may result in compilation errors in Android Studio. This is why we will teach you step-by-step how to import the source code right in the first place. There are many newbie app developers get overwhelmed on this and eventually give up. We have came across those paths and we will reveal to you the smarter steps on importing the source code. Zero errors, that is what you need! </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Android SDK Configuration]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before we use Android Studio, it is important to configure the Android SDK. There are certain important packages that you will need to install to avoid compilation errors. Some of the packages includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Android SDK Tools</li><li>Android SDK Platform-tools</li><li>Android SDK Build-tools</li><li>SDK Platform and its Google APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for a particular Android version.</li><li>Android Support Repository</li><li>Android Support Library</li><li>Google Play services</li><li>Google Repository</li></ul>\n\n<p>If you do not properly configure the Android SDK, chances are you will have many compilation errors. Zero errors, that is what we will teach you! </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Importing Source Code - Correctly!]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Importing the Android Studio project can be quite challenging, especially if you are newbie. This may also make you overwhelmed if you are intermediate Android developers. But, we have good news for you! We have created a comprehensive and step-by-step video for you, just to teach you how to import the source code correctly within minutes. Note that NOT every code you need to \"touch\", we will tell you which codes you need to make adjustment, and there is no coding or programming skills required at all! Many newbie developers get stucked here because of the complexity of Android Studio. No more headache we would say! Zero compilation errors, period. </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Source Code Anatomy] </strong></p>\n\n<p>By the way, we will train you to become an Android \"doctor\" who is able to \"diagnose\" the anatomy of the source code. We will tell you which codes to edit and you simply no need to understand it. We will train you how to change the Targeted SDK, the Package Name and App Name on Smartphone. Edit the string file, apply some refactor steps, change targeted Android SDK version. That's it! </p>\n\n<p><strong>[Photoshop Mastery: Learn the Essence of Photoshop]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Frankly to say that you will need to master Photoshop to sustain in the app business for the long run. If you do not have enough money to fund those programmers as well as graphic designers, then just do it yourself. It is not that challenging, though. We know there are many other Photoshop-alike softwares, but, if we were to compare the quality and the advanced editing features, Photoshop is still a better choice. You may feel uncomfortable at first when using Photoshop, but I bet you will get used to it. Here are the items that we will guide you to make some edition on Photoshop:<br></p>\n\n<ul><li>Game Character</li><li>Game Background</li><li>Game Fonts</li><li>Game Tileset</li><li>Game Icon</li><li>Game Screenshot</li></ul>\n\n<p>Learning too much in a short period of time will make you tension.
