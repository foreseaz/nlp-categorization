Although limited, unless you upgrade, your mobile app can actually be submitted to ITunes, and Google play, and online for download in a little as 2 weeks. The information that we will be using includes an easy to use platform that online requires a login, and password to access. The course will be fairly short. Approximately 1 hour, and it will cover what type of application you would like to produce, how to edit your application, and add different features to it, how to promote it, and push notifications to keep in contact with your subscribers.</p><p style=\"\">Thanks,</p>",
