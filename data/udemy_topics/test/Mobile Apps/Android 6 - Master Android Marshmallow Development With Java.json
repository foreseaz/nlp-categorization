All of these are designed to teach you Android development from scratch and get more and more complex as you work your way through the course, as we start using more advanced Android concepts in the apps being build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A basic \"hello\" app, then a button click app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A \"top 10\" downloader apps that downloads and parses information from apples servers regarding their up to date 10 ten lists of apps and songs from iTunes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> A youtube player to show how to play Youtube videos and playlists in your own app.  And how to add your own custom code in certain places (when an ad plays, when the video starts, when the video pauses, etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move on to a Calculator app where you learn to put together a calculator and add common calculator functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Flickr app is next where you will learn how to use a popular image sharing site and how to search and retrieve a list of images by a custom search term and display them in a list and then in a separate enlarged window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving on, we will develop an app that accesses the built in Android Contacts using the new Marshmallow permissions functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we will create our own Friends app to maintain our own database of friends in a database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Personal notes app is next where you will build a complete personal notes application, including notification scheduler/alarm, notes capability and the use of the camera or photo gallery to add an optional picture, and then saving of the picture to the local device, Google Drive, or Dropbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More apps are being added to the course!

Finally a course that teaches you real skills you can use and understand.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tAnd its most definitely newbie friendly, even if you have never coded before. But experienced coders will get a lot out of the course as well!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tWhether you've already been creating apps for Android, or you're ready to get started, this course is designed to help you become one of the first developers on Android's new Marshmallow system!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tMarshmallow is geared toward better interaction between the user and the device, which means that programmers need to completely revamp the way they create apps. This course is designed to help you get the skills you need so you can be at the forefront of Marshmallow app development.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Master App Building for Android Marshmallow.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tUnderstand naming conventions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tInstall and Configure tools on Windows or Mac (videos for both platforms included).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tLearn Debugging Techniques  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tExplore how Android works “under the hood\".  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tUnderstand how to build Android Apps.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tHow to use the new Android SDK Marshmallow while still targeting older versions of Android, and how to support the majority of Android devices out there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Be Part of The Next Generation of Android</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tAndroid 6.0, or Marshmallow, is the biggest thing to come to Android devices (including tablets) since the development of the Android system.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tWith Marshmallow, you'll never have to miss new email with new displays allowing your inbox to show next to the message you're reading.
