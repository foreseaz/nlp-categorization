    "description": "<p>After researching, reading feedback and taking into consideration the latest features in PhoneGap, we have updated the course. The updated course contains an entire section on Plugins like geolocation API, camera API, Contact API, Accelerometer. There are more lectures in this new version explaining PhoneGap in detail. First 7 section of the course contains the updated version of the course. For already existing students, old version is still available from Section 8.</p><p>Did you ever wonder â€œWish I could create a mobile app for my business or my customers\". Well, then do you know basic HTML and JavaScript (like tags, few styles, functions, etc.)? If the answer is yes, then this course is made for you.</p><p>PhoneGap solves the problem of learning different frameworks and languages, by using standards-based web technologies to bridge web applications and mobile devices. Since PhoneGap apps are standards compliant, they're future-proofed to work with browsers as they evolve. In other words, <b>a month on native app development is converted to just 4 days to write the same amount of app functionality in PhoneGap.</b></p><p><b>Why take this course?</b></p><p>PhoneGap has been downloaded over 1 million times and is being used by over <b>400,000 developers</b>. Thousands of apps built using PhoneGap are available in mobile app stores and directories. Today, your favorite apps like <b>BBC, IGN games, Rormix, Browser Quest, MathIQ</b> are using PhoneGap. If you are not creating an app for industrial grade real-time calculations, PhoneGap is made for you.</p><p><b>How much time does it take to complete the course?</b></p><p><b>What am I going to get from this course?</b></p><ul><li>Lifetime access to the course</li><li>Downloadable project files</li><li>Create a fully functional app</li><li>Technical Support</li></ul><p><b>What are the software and other requirements for the course?</b></p><p>You should have basic knowledge of web technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript. Additionally you will require Android SDK, Eclipse and PhoneGap installed on your computer. All of which are available for free for Mac and PC. </p>",
