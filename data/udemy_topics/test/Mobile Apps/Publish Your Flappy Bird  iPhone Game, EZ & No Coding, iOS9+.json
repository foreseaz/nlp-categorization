You are shown every single step it takes to turn the existing game into your very own. You can apply any theme that you want. Some examples are Flappy Angel, demons, ducks, or penguins. Your imagination is the limit!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t    This course assumes you know nothing about making games, and without coding not even a single line of code, you will publish your very own game to the apple app store!  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  The game comes with multiple advertising channels to bring your passive income.  </p>",
