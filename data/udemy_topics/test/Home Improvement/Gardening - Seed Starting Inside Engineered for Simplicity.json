From seed to plant ready for transplant outside, I will walk you through the process step by step showing you not only what I do, but why I do it so that you can not only successfully follow my method, but adapt it for your individual needs. This course can help you with your indoor seed starting regardless of whether you're planning an urban vegetable garden, a container garden, want to use the square foot method in raised beds, or want to go all organic with your gardening approach.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Easily Start Seeds Inside Successfully Using the Methods Described in this Comprehensive Course.</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Discover how to take the work out of seed starting</li>  \t<li>Learn how to make watering easy.</li>  \t<li>Grow strong seedlings that succeed in your garden.</li>  \t<li>Take the guesswork out of lighting.</li>  \t<li>Avoid costly mistakes with fertilizer. </li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Seed Starting Inside is the Cornerstone of a Successful Garden - and the Only Option If You Want Access to a Wide Variety of Delicious Heirloom Vegetables.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  I grow hundreds of varieties (yes - varieties) of heirloom vegetables each year, many of which must be started from seed inside if I wish to grow them - I can't go to a local store and purchase plants. Starting from seed not only allows me to save money on plants, but it also enables me to make sure I have strong healthy seedlings ready to plant out on my schedule. In a given year I'll start 45-60 different varieties of tomatoes, and 15-30 different varieties of sweet peppers inside - along with several other types of vegetables. Rest assured though that my methods will work for you whether you have a small container garden or a large three acre plot.  </p>  <p>  \t        In my search to find solutions and improved methods to the various challenges gardening provides, I've taken a holistic approach to gardening. When searching for a solution or improvement to a current process, I heavily consider both related fields of study as well as related environmental factors. This has led me to researching things such as hydroponics, aquaponics, grafting, and vermicomposting to discover what principles have been learned there that I can leverage to improve my gardening methods. I've also become involved in fields that compliment my gardening needs such as beekeeping and raising chickens. All of this is experience you get to benefit from as you learn the methods I've developed.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Overview</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                          I've used my skills as an engineer to design a method for seed starting that minimizes much of the work involved, reduces costs without cutting corners I'll regret later, and helps to ensure my success. You can benefit from my experience by taking this course which enables you to replicate my successes without the need to experience the failures I've discovered along the way.  </p>  <p>  \t                          What successes have I had? Taste is my biggest success, but I don't have any way of showing that to you short of you trying it for yourself. A great harvest is my second biggest success. Keep in mind I'm not a \"professional farmer\" - I have a day job, yet I easily manage a densely planted 1/4 acre garden producing more food than my family of seven could ever hope to eat. Everything in that garden I start from seed, and many of those seeds must be started inside each year to provide a long enough growing season for the plant. See my promo video for the course for pictures of some of what comes out of my garden every year.  </p>  <p>  \t                          If size is what impresses you, with no special attention (I'm not intentionally trying to grow \"contest vegetables\") I've had 3-4 lb tomatoes, sweet peppers easily 8 inches in length, pumpkins over 100 lbs, and muskmelons (cantaloupe) in excess of 35 lbs. Many of my tomato plants easily reach 7ft - some even having stems that look like miniature trees.  </p>  <p>  \t                          Starting your seeds inside correctly is the foundation for growing good healthy plants in your garden and having a successful harvest. How you start your seeds inside will help you avoid common gardening problems such as aphids and blossom end rot.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course I walk you step by step through the details you need to successfully start seeds inside. I utilize spreadsheets, video lectures, hands on demonstrations, white board sessions, PDF summary points, and pictures showing the principles we're discussing to provide you the details you need to be successful. In addition, I'm available to provide clarification and answer any questions you may have about seed starting inside to help you be successful.  </p>  <p>  \t                          Seed starting inside does not need to be a  lot of work, and it doesn't need to be complicated or intimidating. Let  me make it easy for you.  </p>  <p>  \t  Udemy offers a money back guarantee on my course through their website allowing you to try it risk-free.  </p>  <p>  \t                          Sign up now for my course so I can start working with you to enable you to be successful starting seeds inside.  </p>",
