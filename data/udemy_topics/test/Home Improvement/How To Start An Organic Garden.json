    "description": "<p>This tutorial will provide you with an ambitious actionable plan of garden making from design to building, demonstrating my holistic approach to garden creation, when the whole picture has to be looked at and different areas simultaneously has to be dealt with, in order to to make the most out of the time and saving as much physical work as possible. The tutorial is best for busy people starting a garden or even allotment plot from sketch and who would like to achieve a low maintenance garden, as it contains plenty of shortcuts how to make life easier. It is useful for everybody new to gardening who would like to learn about eco-friendly practices, either because this hobby keeps the body and mind fit and healthy, or because growing your own is the best way to get fresh and organic food, and starting it all as a retirement pastime can be slightly late. If you take gardening seriously, you might have to do some further research (regarding both techniques and plants) but this tutorial will show you what you need to know to start, plus how to be creative and efficient. It’ll help you to make the most important step, which is actually the first step. After you just have to keep going, but by then you’ll be hooked anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Horticulture is in crisis fortunately, as crises are the best opportunities to develop and move forward. After the machinery and chemical revolutions we are at the green revolution now what we can refer to as slow gardening, similar to slow food movement. I started to truly respect nature in my late 20’s when I first experienced the healing power of herbs and since then I try to model it in private gardens at the intersection of grand design and organic approach. The earliest childhood memories are very often related to the garden and with every single green space I come across with, I keep trying to recover that lost paradise unconsciously and constantly.</p>",
