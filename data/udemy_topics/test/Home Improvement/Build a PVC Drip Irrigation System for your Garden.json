PVC drip systems don't deal well with big changes in slope in a garden.  Slopes cause uneven water pressure in the pipes and you will have some areas getting too much water and others not enough.  So if you garden is on a hill side or drops more than 2 or 3 inches over 50 feet you may want to consider a different watering option.  </strong><br></p>",
