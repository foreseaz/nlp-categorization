    "description": "<p>Hi there. My name is Tim! I was raised in suburban Florida and homeschooled in a strict environment for much of my childhood. By the time I was a teenager, <strong>I was almost entirely disconnected</strong> from the 'real world' and had developed depression, social anxiety, and the hardest of all to cope with, severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. At that point <strong>I was doing everything I could to avoid other people or social situations.</strong></p><p>A magnet for constant bullying and abuse, <strong>I withdrew deeper and deeper into my own bubble of what I thought was safety but in reality became a nightmare of fear and loneliness.</strong> I was a mess.<br></p><p><strong>That was then.</strong> If you watch my preview video, your first thought will probably be, \"there is <em>no freaking way </em>that's the same person I just read about.\" But it is. Now, this isn't a course about mental illness or dealing with childhood trauma; those things are best left to professional therapists. But I bring up my struggle because all of that hardship set me out on the path of my life; all those obstacles forced me to figure out how to survive in relationships and social situations. </p><p><strong>And once I learned how to survive, I learned how to thrive.</strong></p><p>I created Stronger Social Skills because <strong>I know what it's like to suffer from debilitating shyness, social anxiety, and mental torture.</strong> I know what it's like to sit and cry myself to sleep in utter loneliness, beating myself up night after night for not being able to \"just go out and talk to people.\" I also know what it's like to <strong>overcome my fears, talk to anyone confidently, and create real, deep relationships</strong> with good people. </p><p>I've come a long way on my journey. I've been a radio personality, a comedian, and a teacher. <strong>I went from fighting terror to achieve my first kiss at twenty-one to being able to talk to any woman with ease</strong> (which helped me land the woman of my dreams!). From hiding from other kids at youth group to being on stage in front of ten thousand people. From staring at the ground when people tried to talk to me to pitching a TV show to some of the most powerful executives in Hollywood. Most importantly, <strong>I have learned to make real and lasting relationships</strong> that I wouldn't trade for anything on this earth. I've been working with people to help develop confidence and social skills for years now, but not only am I a teacher, <strong>I have lived the worst and best of it myself</strong>, and that's what makes Stronger Social Skills different, and I <em>know</em> I can help you as well!<br></p>",
