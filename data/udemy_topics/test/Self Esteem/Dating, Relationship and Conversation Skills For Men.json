    "description": "<p>Men are happier when they have control over their dating life, it’s a logical fact.<br></p>\n\n<p>\t Just knowing that you have that you have the ability to attract a girl can make you’re life more fulfilling.</p>\n\n<p>\t I know this first hand from having achieved complete satisfaction in my own dating life and from helping 1,000s of others do the same.</p>\n\n<p>\t I have been lucky enough to work with men looking to find the perfect girl, looking for less traditional relationships and those just looking to have fun.</p>\n\n<p>\t The tricky part is that most dating, relationship and conversation advice that you’ll find is just simply wrong but we’re tricked in to believing its right.</p>\n\n<p>\t Even worse, many men feel shame for taking charge of their life and going after their dreams. As a result of this, men are forced to accept whatever they can get and as a result the divorce rate has never been higher.</p>\n\n<p>\t This course was created to give men the freedom to choose their life partner(s), life style and the confidence to succeed with women and in all aspects of their life.</p>\n\n<p>\t This isn’t one of those training programs that throws a bunch of theory at you, pumps you up and then fails to deliver results…</p>\n\n<p>\t By the end of this training, you will not only have gone on multiple dates and created a social circle of your own but you’ll have the real world experience, confidence and intuition to succeed in any social interaction going forward.</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know what to say to start a conversation?</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know how to hold a conversation?</p>\n\n<p>\t Girls flake on you?</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know how to ask for a number?</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know to build attraction?</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know how to turn up the heat?</p>\n\n<p>\t Don’t know how to get that ever-elusive kiss close?</p>\n\n<p>\t Want to win back your ex?</p>\n\n<p>\t Want to turn that friend into a lover?</p>\n\n<p>\t This course will teach you all of the above and so much more through over 5 hours of lectures strategically paired with REAL WORLD exercises based on the same scientifically proven teaching strategies used by the best universities around the world.</p>\n\n<p>\t This training has delivered results to over 10,000 men and is perfect for:</p>\n\n<ul>\t<li>Men who are tired of accepting mediocrity</li>\t<li>Men who want choice, or at the very least, to know they have the ability to attract a girl</li>\t<li>Everyone tired of weird pickup tactics that don’t work</li>\t<li>Men tired of running out of things to say</li>\t<li>Men tired of ending up in the ‘friend zone’</li>\t<li>Men who want to shoot for the stars and live the life they know they’re capable of</li>  </ul>\n\n<p>\t When you’re done with this course, you’ll have the skills, knowledge and first hand experience in order to approach any girl in any situation, never run out of things to say, and turn up the heat with that special someone.</p>\n\n<p>\t AND you’ll have access to the course for life in addition to the additional material that will be released to the course members over the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>\t REMINDER: This is a risk free purchase with Udemy’s 30 day money back guarantee. Just imagine what life would be like if within 30 days you had the confidence, skills and gusto to approach any girl you wanted.</p>\n\n<p>\t With enthusiasm,</p>\n\n<p>\t Erik Kiton</p>\n\n<p>\t P.S. Due to the controversial nature of the content within this course, I highly recommend getting started immediately as I can’t guarantee that this course will be available to purchase forever.</p>",
