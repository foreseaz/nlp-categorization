    "description": "<p><strong></strong></p>Hypnosis course to Stop Blushing Fast with Guided Hypnosis<p> has been created to give you a similar effective experience to what my private clients get, to help you to overcome and stop blushing with hypnosis it is important to realize what blushing actually is, blushing is a mini anxiety attack and what is most important for you to know is that anxiety is actually a human alarm system to help protect you.</p>\n\n<p>However why anxiety becomes such a problem for people is that the alarm seems to go off for no rational reason. So what is happening is that your subconscious mind is attempting to warn and protect you of a  perceived danger. Yes perceived not a real danger so just like people with allergies that are an over reaction by the body to again perceived danger because the subconscious mind believes the body is under attack from some substance it fires of its defenses causing the allergy.</p>\n\n<p>So anxiety and blushing is the subconscious mind triggering off a chemical reaction in your body to cause those blushing sensations. Now with Hypnosis you will educate your subconscious mind with new information so that there is no need to cause you to blush.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What I will teach with</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hypnosis course to Stop Blushing Fast with Guided Hypnosis</strong></em></p><p><em></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>1.
