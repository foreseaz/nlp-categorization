In fact, some of the most confident people are not the most beautiful people, at least not according to the media’s standards.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>So what’s their secret?\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>I grew up terribly shy and tongue tied. So much so that I was introduced as the “<em>shy one who doesn’t speak much</em>.” \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Public speaking used to be my all-time biggest fear. So big in fact that I would have preferred to die. Perhaps you can relate?\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, that’s all in the past! Today I have over <strong>10,000 students worldwide</strong>, over <strong>25,000 YouTube subscribers</strong>, I have also spoken with <strong>Robert Kiyosaki</strong> (author of <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong>) in front of thousands of people. I’ve been a Learning Annex instructor for many years and I’ve taught in-person workshops for the last 12 years.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>So how did I make the switch from soft spoken and shy wallflower to confidence rockstar?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>That’s what this entire course is all about!\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for <strong>more success</strong> in life, whether it’s personal or professional success, this course can help unleash the <strong>fearless ‘you’</strong> that’s waiting to shine and sparkle.</p>",
