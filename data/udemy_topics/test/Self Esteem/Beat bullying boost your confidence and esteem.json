    "description": "<p>I have recorded this course because there are so many who suffer alone at the hands of bullies and feel isolated as many bullies work in groups to elevate themselves from their own insecurities lack of confidence and their own self esteem that makes them depend on the gang or group to support their bullying needs. So that when they pick on someone who has no confidence because people of low self esteem are perceived as easy targets for the bully to improve their own confidence by targeting them. What you will get from this program is interactive lessons that with teach you a powerful but simple technique to let go the negative feelings you have been made to feel from low confidence and because the mind and body are connected you will become stronger psychologically boost your self esteem and will become less attractive to the person or persons who have been bullying you.</p><p>This technique is called emotional freedom technique and I am a therapist who has been using it with my clients since 2006 with outstanding results so much so that I was inspired to record this and many other programs like it. You are going to be taught how to apply emotional freedom technique and how it can influence the body with a simple breathing exercise. Then after experiencing the mind body connection or psychosomatic ( Psycho in the mind ) ( Somatic in the body ) you will be guided through a interactive experience with emotional freedom technique to eliminate the negative feelings you have been feeling and by letting go these feelings you will boost your confidence and self esteem.</p><p>You will then be offered a mopping up section to remove any fragments of bad feelings that remain that may also hold you back from having that inner confidence. Then I will help you to program your mind with suggestions of confidence and feelings of self esteem with a hypnotic recording called monster confidence and esteem that by being a clinical hypnotherapist I have recorded especially for you and this course for personal growth to boost your self confidence and esteem to new and higher levels.</p><p><strong style=\"\">All Videos are downloadable for easier access offline</strong></p><ul style=\"\"><li><strong style=\"\"></strong></li>  </ul>",
