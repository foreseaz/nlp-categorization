Volume 1: Pictures!</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the past 8 years, I've been traveling the world teaching men of all ages how to meet and attract <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">all different kinds</em> of women! From New York to Paris and from Sydney to Prague, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I've helped men not only learn to get laid, but meet the women of their dreams</strong>, wherever they may be! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I've worked so hard at this over the past ten years that universities like Yale and Columbia have invited me to speak and I've even been on Nightline and NBC news.</strong> You'll forgive me if I seem confident when I say that not only do I know I can help you, it's my <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">passion.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">From some of my students:</strong></em><br></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Gareth's texting instruction has helped me significantly improve my texting. I used to get anxious and not know how to effectively communicate with women via text. Gareth's instructions were easy to implement and I now text in a more direct, playful manner that women have come to love.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ron, Prague - 2015</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“Gareth gave me some of the best texting advice I ever received, some of it flew in the face of conventional wisdom, and he's absolutely right.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, Los Angeles - 2015</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\"I really enjoyed being coached by Gareth ; his teaching is extremely personalized, he is emotionally committed to the success of his students. He is an esthete, he loves the good things of life in a very empowering way, and one month later I still get compliments about my style, thanks to the advice he gave me”.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Arnaud, NYC - 2015</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">This course is one of four courses to help you design The Perfect Tinder Profile so that you can use this incredible app to meet women of all ages everywhere you go</strong> (Volume 2: Tagline, Volume 3: Opener, and Volume 4: Getting The Number are on their way!).
