But without just a few key strategies, it's easy to spin wheels, work hard and have nothing to show for it ... or worse, delay getting started for months or even years. </strong></p><ul><li>Would you like to get exposure to new audiences who would be eager to sign up for your email list...if they just knew you existed?</li><li>Are you spending a lot of time writing blog posts for a tiny, tiny following?</li><li>Have you considered guest blogging but felt overwhelmed by figuring out the process (and it seems to take LOTS of time)?</li></ul><p>If you answered YES to any of these question, this course is for you. If you're a small business seeking a big online presence, you'll get the tools and processes you need to make this happen. </p><p>What's different about this course? We focus on building a system so getting each guest post will be easier than the one before. You build relationships with host bloggers so your pitch gets a warm welcome and you even get invited to contribute</p><p><br></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>",
