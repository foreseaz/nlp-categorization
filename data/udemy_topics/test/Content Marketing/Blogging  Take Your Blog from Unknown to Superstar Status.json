Most bloggers have their websites visited by only a few friends and relatives. Maybe you are in the same situation.</p>  <p>And most people who created a blog website and started blogging are stuck. Nothing seem to work for them. I was here for years.</p>  <p>In this letter I will show you one of the best ways to make people wanting to read your blog and even recommend other people to read it too...</p>  <p>Before I do that, let me introduce myself.</p>  <p>My name is Florin Rosoga, I am a online business consultant, coach and author. I started using online tools several years ago to promote my books and consulting services. Like many other people I thought that by posting on a blog, on Facebook or Twitter people will notice me and I will get customers.</p>  <p>But that didn't happen at all.</p>  <p>They continued to ... just ignore me.</p>  <p>It wasn't that long ago when nobody seemed to care about what I had to offer. I was frustrated and couldn't understand why other people that seemed to have inferior products and services could thrive, while I was stuck.</p>  <p>I decided to change that and the moment when things turned in a different direction was when I finally understood how do people really behave, read and spend time online.</p>  <p>I called it the <strong>Online Behavioral Routines</strong></p>  <p>From that moment I applied what I learned to my own blog, my own social media pages, my own podcast each time with more and more success.</p>  <p>In 2014 more than 3.3 Million visits on one blog only. And in 2015, as I write this, there are already 3.5 Million (see proof video below)... and my goal for 2015 is that of 5 Million.</p>  <p>After a lot of tests &amp; research and testing the results were surprising: people do actually read in a completely different way online than they do it offline. That's because they have the specific <strong>Online Behavioral Routines.</strong></p>  <p>So I started defining all my activity around these and my traffic exploded. People started spending much more time on my blog, they started recommending it to their friends and kept coming.</p>  <p>Again and again.</p>  <p>They left comments, shared my articles on Facebook (having 5K shares for an article became usual). It was so easy after I understood how people actually read online and I started writing “in their internal language\".</p>  <p>It was like when you are in a foreign country speak to someone that doesn't understand your language. Suddenly <strong>he starts understanding you and speak your language</strong>.</p>  <p>Now YOU listen to each word he speaks!</p>  <p>Now you understand him and want to hear him again!</p>  <p><strong>WHY PEOPLE FAIL BLOGGING</strong></p>  <p>People fail with a blog for several reasons. I worked with hundreds of people who started a blog and asked them what's their main osbtacle.</p>  <p>Here is what they answered:</p>  <ul><li>People think <strong>they have to be a technical guy</strong> to be able to blog. In fact you just have to know some basic technical stuff for having a nice, working blog. You don't need any special knowledge as you will see.<strong> I will teach you how to get over the necessary technical stuff</strong>.</li><li>People think <strong>they need much time to create and start a blog</strong>. Well, it means usually a couple of hours in a week, the most important is not how much time you spend, but to do – as little time as you have – it for the proper period of time to create momentum. <strong>I will teach you what's essential</strong>, so you can just focus on it.</li><li>People <strong>do not want their friends to know they have a blog and read it</strong>, thinking they don't know how to write and they are not good enough. In fact, you can start a blog that – at least in the beginning – your friends and relatives will not know you are the blogger and won't bother you. <strong>I will also teach you how to write so that they WILL WANT to read you</strong>. And you will enjoy that...</li></ul>      <p>With this course you get:</p>  <ul><li>Easy to follow step by step lectures, in only 1-2 hours per week.
