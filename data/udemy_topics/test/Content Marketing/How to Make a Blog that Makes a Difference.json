They spend days trying to get the background color of every page just right. They look at other people’s blogs and wonder what it would take to make a blog that looks similar.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       In other words, they stress out about the technical details of running a blog.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Here’s the thing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The technical side of blogging is important, however, it is not the ultimate critical factor that determines the success or failure of your blog. You can be an expert at hosting, word press, and content creation but still fail to receive any tangible success from your blog.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       This is why, in this course, we leave the technical stuff behind. Instead, we focus on the components of blogging that empower you to make a difference and help others.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       For example, you’ll learn  </p>  <li style=\"\">The hidden structure of the perfect blog post</li>  <li style=\"\">How to make progress using the SPIN formula</li>  <li style=\"\">How to make your blog more interesting</li>  <li style=\"\">How to get readers for your blog</li>  <li style=\"\">and so much more.<br style=\"\">  </li>  <blockquote style=\"\">  \t        You can see a complete list of the lessons available to you by scrolling to the bottom of this page.  </blockquote>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Every lesson is filled with practical direction packaged in enjoyable, straight-to-the-point videos, worksheets, and quizzes. If something is unclear, you can even leave your question and get an answer almost immediately.  </p>  <h5 style=\"\">The best part? <span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);\">You’re Already Making a Difference if you take this course today.</span></h5>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The money you pay to take this course will help me continue to further my mission to help orphans all over the world.  <span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\"> </span>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       So far, I’ve touched Uganda, Congo, Nigeria, Haiti, UAE, and Mexico. My blog is an important part of this work and I have no plans of stopping anytime soon.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If you want to <strong style=\"\">help people</strong>, you can.<strong style=\"\"> </strong>If you want to <strong style=\"\">make a difference</strong>, you can.<strong style=\"\"> </strong>If you have a message worth sharing, a blog is a pretty good place to start.
