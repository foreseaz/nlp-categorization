For a limited time only - the course is available for $79, instead of the regular price of $149.  ALL discount coupons have been removed. </strong></em> </p><p>This online blog writing course is exactly what I needed 12 years ago. My success in blogging was made possible by the months and years of learning, attempting, tweaking, tinkering and trying every option possible. I guess you could say it was mostly trial and error.</p><p>When I decided to give freelance blog writing and web design a shot,  I wasn't quite sure what areas of freelancing should get the most of my attention. Once I learned to get the focus off me, things started to progress smoothly.</p><p>This course is based on the cardinal rule of blogging:</p><p><strong><em>\"Successful blog writing requires that you write on schedule and that you always place your readers' interests above your own. \"</em></strong></p><p>This blogging course was designed to help you avoid the mistakes I made and bypass the many hours of research.  That way, when you make a mistake, it will be a new one of your own. </p><p><strong>This course will give you a completely new perspective on what it takes to fill a blog with high-quality original content.</strong> If you've been waiting to start blogging, but think you have to have some type of writing degree, it's time to get moving! There is really no degree required. </p><p>Anyone can start a blog, but only after mastering the building blocks for effective blog writing, can blogging be successful. Business blogging is about telling stories that inform, educate, or entertain a target audience. Content marketing is much more that just broadcasting information.</p><p>Quality web content writing is certainly not rocket science, but without the right amount of time, patience, and commitment, your blog or website may never get off the ground.</p>",
