    "description": "<p>This course grew out of a frustration I've seen among self-publishers and authors and I have experienced it myself where we work hard to write a good (hopefully great) book and we want to share it with the world. We know that to give the book a fighting chance in the Amazon Kindle marketplace that it must have a really good cover. The problem is well-designed covers are usually very expensive to create. Alternatively, many independent publishers and writers try to create the covers for themselves and, unfortunately, they possess neither the talent nor the skill to pull that off. This course aims to solve both of those problems.</p><p>Effectively this course consists of step-by-step tutorial videos of how to emulate and/ or copycat the design elements of bona fide New York Times Bestselling book covers so they can create their own Kindle covers this way. Each template tutorial is designed to be a free standing training. Additionally, the course teaches these templates using the free online graphics creation software known as Canva.</p><p>Adding to the value of the course we also teach how to use free public domain image websites for obtaining great looking and very professional photographs and vector graphics for use with their covers.</p><p>Ultimately, we tie the whole package together for Amazon Kindle publishers by showing them how to create ebook covers that look great using Canva and free, but high quality, graphics available on public domain stock photo sites.</p>",
