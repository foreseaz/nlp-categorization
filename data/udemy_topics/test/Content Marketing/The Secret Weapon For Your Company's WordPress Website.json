    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t             This <strong style=\"\">easy, direct course</strong> covers how to easily manage your previously built WordPress website for your business. Perhaps a web designer built your site for your company and now it&#039;s up to you to manage it. You probably had some cursory direction given to you, but maybe you have already forgotten it or need a little hand holding now that it&#039;s time to make some updates. <strong style=\"\">I&#039;ll take the pain out of having to learn a new skill set.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             This comprehensive, <strong style=\"\">easy-to-follow course</strong> will guide you through everything you need to create great looking posts, adding pages, adding some great looking photo galleries, assigning user roles for managing the site, what plug-ins can do for you, what plug-ins you should have, managing SPAM, how to encourage social sharing, how to add video, using best SEO practices and more. I&#039;ll even show you how to add PayPal buttons on your site to collect payments.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             You will watch over my shoulder as I walk you through the ins-and-outs of your WordPress site. By the end of this course you will be able to confidently manage your WordPress company website and <strong style=\"\">MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE THE HERO</strong> in the process.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             Each lecture in this course is broken down to it&#039;s most essential aspect. The course is meant to save you valuable time (since this may not be your only job description) and can be easily referenced when you need reinforcement when it comes to editing your site. Did you forget how to do something? Don&#039;t know how to do something? Just reference the course and jump in right where you need to.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  Since all WordPress Themes are different, I have set up a private Facebook group where I can address specific theme issues or elaborate on any particular item.</strong> What is covered here will give you the fundamentals you need and enable you to keep your site looking great while taking the hassle out of learning a new skill set or improving upon your current one.  </p>",
