Many spend hundreds and thousands of dollars creating beautiful pitching presentations:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Television Pilots</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Sizzle Reels</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Presentation Tapes</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t       But most forget about the <em style=\"\">paperwork</em>.  When pitching a show concept it is vital to have <strong style=\"\">both </strong>written and visual presentations. You want a complete package to help tell and sell your story.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       The paperwork proposal is like the engine inside of a car. Yes, the car looks great but how does it run? How does it get from place to place? Where do you park it? Network  executives and investors will ask lots of questions before and after they see your visual presentation. This course will prepare you for most of those questions.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t           In this course I will use my original pitching package that earn a 24 hour green-light from a television network executive and went on to become a hit celebrity talk show on a top tier cable network. I will utilize videos and power point slides to dissect the written proposal and showcase <strong style=\"\">some </strong>of the original TV pilot.  Footage from the TV pilot will be used as examples to drive home certain key elements needed in a written proposal.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       This course was designed to be &quot;On Demand&quot; &amp; &quot;Time&quot; friendly . All videos and lessons are up for a lifetime. You can complete the course in one day, one week or one month it&#039;s totally up to you. After you complete the course there will be a special gift waiting for you!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       A downloadable PDF of this winning proposal will be provided at the end of the course as a &quot;Thank You&quot; gift from me to you.  </p>",
