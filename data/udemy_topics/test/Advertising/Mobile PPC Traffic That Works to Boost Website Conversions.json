If you are like me, the problem you may have faced is that you want to get massive amounts of valuable and targeted traffic to your website without breaking the bank. You want a massive bang for your buck! You may be paying high rates for the visitors and conversions that you want. In addition to that, the amount you pay per click is high (compared to mobile advertising which is as low as $0.05 per click).
