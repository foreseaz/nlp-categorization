    "description": "<p>In Part 1 of the course you learn first the Hebrew letters, and basic reading.  You immediately move forward to the basic building blocks of the language, which are applicable to both Biblical and modern Hebrew. The Bible in the original? An Israeli book or newspaper?  It will be yours!  In Part 1 you progress from the most simple patterns to the past tense.  Grammar terms aren't used, and you are empowered because you understand how all the components of the language function.  Practical exercises are given at every step of the way, and all you need to do are the exercises in order to master the material. All the learning is incremental, and review is built into the course itself.  You will become a Hebrew lover just like me!<br></p>",
