    "description": "<p>*This course is part of the Adobe CC for Entrepreneurs Series*</p> <p>In this course you&#039;ll learn how to use Premiere Pro CC to create professional, high quality videos without spending a lot of time in the editing bay. You&#039;ll also learn how to think like a professional video editor. Many amateur video editors make the mistake of trying to do too much while editing, either to cover up their mistakes in filming or in an attempt to make their average video look more professional.</p> <p>Neither of these strategies work.</p> <p>In this course you&#039;ll learn how to deconstruct the work of top videos editors so that you can start creating high quality video edits without spending years laboriously learning the “tricks of the trade.”</p> <p>You&#039;ll also learn how to think of your entire video production workflow, from field production to post production. When I started with Premiere I thought I could fix a lot of the deficiencies in my raw video by using video editing tricks. </p> <p>Here&#039;s the truth...its just doesn&#039;t work. </p>And even if you can get it to work, it doesn&#039;t make sense when you count the time, energy and money it costs. An ounce of proper filming technique in the field is worth a pound of effort in the editing suite. This course doesn&#039;t just teach you how to edit in Premiere, you&#039;ll also learn how to optimizing your workflow so that you are spending your time effectively while editing.",
