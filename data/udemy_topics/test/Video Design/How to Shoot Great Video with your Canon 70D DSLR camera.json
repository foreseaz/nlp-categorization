In my role as a professional freelance video cameraman I get to shoot with a large variety and style of cameras.  When I first picked up a Canon DSLR to shoot video I have to admit to being a bit baffled as to even how to switch it into video mode or even focus the camera correctly!</p><p>Courses such as this help you short cut the often quite steep learning curve. <strong> For instance did you know you just can't use any old SD card to shoot video?</strong>  You get the benefits of my experience (and mistakes made) so you can concentrate on capturing whats happening in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>Course Content &amp; Overview</strong></p><p>This course is aimed at people new to shooting video with their Canon 70D or perhaps more experienced users wanting to hone their skills. It details the menu set-ups you need, lenses, exposure, picture profiles, audio and much more with some common real life examples.<br></p><p>Its a 10 chapter video course and contains 1 hour and 8 minutes of material (I was hoping to keep it under 1 hour so I could say “Learn in under 1 hour”, but its close).  I’m not a fan of some online courses promising 4 or more hours of material because if you’re like me you will never get through the whole lot.</p><p>What you will learn starts with the camera hardware and menu settings, I then move into using the auto and full manual controls, exposure, focus, audio and then some real world examples of putting it all into practice.</p><p>My style is short and sharp and I only discuss the areas of the camera essential to shooting video.</p><p><strong>What this course isn’t? </strong>This course deals solely with shooting video with the Canon 70D, it does not go into shooting still pictures or post-production and video editing. </p><p>My aim is to give you the essential information only for shooting video so that you can hit the ground running and get out there and start producing some great looking videos, family movies, youtube clips or perhaps your first short film.</p>",
