    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t Thanks to the continuous development of technology, which has simplified and slimmed down audio and video recording instruments, anyone today has the opportunity to create a video of professional quality. But if we all learn to just press a bunch of buttons in a hurry, very few of us will have the opportunity to learn the rules of cinematic language.The grammar and syntax of audiovisual communication, which allow you to describe things that others understand, are often confused and become a burden in editing courses and schools, and are more intellectual than practical. Our course is a complete and practical course that completely takes place on the set, “on the road” and allows everyone to create projects that are professionally correct.  Yet, photography, video and audio each have a precise language, with a grammar and syntax that are still unknown to most users. Most of us today utilize these fascinating, powerful and extraordinarily effective tools in improvised, limited and often incorrect ways.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tOur audiovisual recording course will provide you with all the basic knowledge of a language that will enable anyone who sends and receives an audiovisual to achieve a better and more satisfying use of these new tools of communication.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tHow to shoot a subject, how to compose a “framing”, how to obtain maximum results from these tools: lesson after lesson you will learn to “write” with an audiovisual, in a targeted effort to not only get the most from documenting an event in which you are the leading actors, but also to create a product of pure imagination. For example, if you are not aware of the rules pertaining to“angle of view” and“reversed angle” when (incorrectly) shooting two people talking together, to the viewer it may appear as if these two people were engaged in a conversation with other people rather than with each other. “Pan”, “point of view (POV) shot”, “sequence shot” and “cut” are all the elements of a language that has a precise expressive meaning. Mastering this language will enable you to better communicate your ideas and imaginations to others.  </p>",
