    "description": "<p>Beautiful design is just as important as functionality when it comes to the Web. In this course, , you'll learn basic principles of design while creating two visually different interior pages for desktop and mobile. First, you'll go over the basic principles of HTML and CSS (as ideas, not actual code), and discover how you can make your page accessible and usable to all audiences. Along the way, you'll be covering important aspects of design such as typography, use of color, layout, and design aesthetic. Finally, you'll go over navigation principles and how to make your web design responsive for desktops and mobile devices. When you're finished, you'll not only have two uniquely beautiful web pages, but you'll also have a better understanding of what you can do to design a front-end experience for your webpage.Â </p>",
