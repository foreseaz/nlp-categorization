Wordpress powers 20% of all websites on the Internet, which means that if you create a successful Wordpress plugin, it can be a very lucrative business where you can get many customers, and make a lot of money.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                          This course teaches you how to tell if your Wordpress plugin idea is good, how to develop the Wordpress plugin, or how to cheaply hire a developer to get the plugin developed. The course teaches you about other parts of the business like how to promote your Wordpress plugin, and strategies for how to monetize and make money from the plugin.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Personal Touch Like No Other Course</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                        In addition to the course lectures, you get my help and advice! Students are able to start discussions and message me with private questions. I answer 99% of questions within 24 hours. I love interacting and helping people who take my course, and I look forward to getting to know you, and helping you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>How The Course Is Structured</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                          The course is made up of over 1 hour of video tutorials. To get the materials for the course and to bring you the most helpful and insightful information, I interviewed an experienced Wordpress plugin developer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Who Should Take This Course</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            You should take this course if you are looking for unique business ideas, or if you are a user of Wordpress and want to get into the Wordpress plugin business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            If you are a Wordpress developer, you should take this course to learn the business side of Wordpress plugins.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>I Will Help You Promote Your Plugin (Worth More $ Than The Course Price)</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          To help you succeed, when your plugin is ready, I will make a video to help you promote your plugin on my YouTube channel (250,000+ total views and 1,000+ daily views across all videos) to help you get the word out about your plugin. I'll also share your course to a few thousand people on my social media channels. That in itself will pay for the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Still Not Sure If The Course Is Right For You?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          There is no reason to wonder. The course comes with a full 30-day money back guarantee from Udemy. So if the course is not what you expected, no problem. Just get a refund.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                MONEY BACK GUARANTEE  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em>The course comes with an unconditional, Udemy backed, 30 day money-back guarantee so you can try the course risk free.
