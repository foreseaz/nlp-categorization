    "description": "<p>  \tBy following this structured video course, you will learn how to  convert fix-width layouts to responsive layouts, contain a fluid layout  with maximum or minimum properties, write syntax for a media query,  select breakpoints, write HTML to embed all the saved elements into a  page, and add CSS to your site ensuring that you have the skills to  create your very own responsive website quickly and efficiently.  </p>  <p>  \tResponsive Web Design – From Concept to Complete Site starts with an  overview of the technology, the best practices to follow, and then moves  on to a complete implementation of a responsive site using HTML5 and  CSS3 media queries. After learning the essentials of responsive web  design in the introductory section, you will walk through splitting a  mockup into images and content areas, defining a fluid grid using those  divisions, creating a percentage-based layout for the fluid grid with  CSS, and then begin creating a full-functional responsive page. The  latter section contains hands-on exercises that will walk you through  all the HTML5 and CSS3 code required to build your sample page.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course ends with an overview on the future of web design, the  features you can use today, and tips on how to remain current in the  field.  </p>  <p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  \t<strong style=\"\">Joshua Miller</strong> is a freelance web designer, college professor, and  interactive artist living in eastern Pennsylvania.
