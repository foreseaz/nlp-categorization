    "description": "<p>  Photoshop is a lot of fun and it dominates the image editing software market since image editing is a thing. </p><p>I have initially put this course together as part of my teaching at Prva gimnazija in Maribor for last year students aged between 17 and 18. I modified it so it can be taken by anyone with no per-knowledge of Photoshop. All you need is a computer with Photoshop and some very basic computer skills. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 1</strong></p><p><em>You will learn why it is important to have a banner and how we will make one. We will have a look at  some existing websites with a poorly made banner to prove the importance of a good banner.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 2</strong></p><p><em>You will learn the layout in Photoshop so you will know how to use it for anything. Navigating will no longer be a worry. We will open an existing photo that is located on a computer/online. You will learn how to use Bucket Tool and create a new \nLayer. I will explain you everything you need to know about Layers and why they are so awesome. You will also learn how to resize using the Move Tool. I'll show you a trick how to add more background material to a layer without re-sizing it. I will teach you the Eye Dropping and Gradient Tool so you will know how to blend two colors from two layers and pick and use any color you see.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Section 3</strong></p><p><em>I will show you how to work with text. You will learn how to add text and make it beautiful by using the Blending Options. I will also teach you hot to use Brushes and what they are for. We will learn about Brush Presets, use some funky ones and even add some from the internet. At the end you will see how much you have learn by completing a Quiz and friends' admiration of your new banner. <br></em></p><p><em> </em><br></p>",
