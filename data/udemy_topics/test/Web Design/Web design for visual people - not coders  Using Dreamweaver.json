We won't hide from code but we'll use all the visual tools that makes Dreamweaver so amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the skills you’ll need to become a professional web designer. You’ll learn how to make responsive websites in Dreamweaver as well as learning what to charge and how to manage a website project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover everything you need to build your first website. From creating your first page through to uploading your website to the internet. During the course we’ll create a website for a mock creative agency - creating mobile and desktop versions. See our example here:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a Dreamweaver Certified Instructor and an Adobe Certified Web Specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With exercise files you can download and work along with me. At the end of each video I have a downloadable version of where we are in the process so you can compare your project with mine making it easy to see where you might have a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be showing you how to work with Dreamweaver to easily create HTML &amp; CSS websites. How to create mobile and tablet versions of your design and how to test your website on your phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be teaching you how to create navigation bars, how to work with responsive images and favicons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll work with Dreamweaver’s new Bootstrap integration to easily add carousels, tabbed menu’s and accordions. Even easier you’ll learn to impress clients by embedding videos, calendars, maps, event ticketing &amp; social sharing options. <br><br>Know that I’ll be around to help - if you get lost you can message in the forum and together we’ll get you back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s time to upgrade your skills, get that better job and impress your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the requirements?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You'll need a copy of Dreamweaver CC 2015 or above.
