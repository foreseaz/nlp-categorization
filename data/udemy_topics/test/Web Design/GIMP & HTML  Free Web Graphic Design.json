    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Make Your Web Page Shine</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    If you&#039;ve always wanted to snaz up your web pages with some fancy graphics but couldn&#039;t afford the software licensing fees, image costs, or consulting service expenses, then let me show you how to get the project done simply and with little or no expense.  This course combines the free GIMP image editor with a free HTML aware text editor to show you how to produce professional looking web pages on a budget.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Create Free and Inexpensive Web Graphics</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    In this course I&#039;ll teach you how to use the <strong style=\"\">free </strong>Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to produce stunning web graphics on a PC or a Mac.  Learn to produce common web graphics such as bullets, logos, banners, separators, and buttons.  Learn where to find free and inexpensive images on the Internet.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Display It All on Your Web Page</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    In the second half of the course I&#039;ll show you how to use HTML and a browser to display and animate those images.  Learn to use table and div tags to position graphics and text on the screen in order to lay out entire web pages.  Learn how to use mouse events to make pages react to the user’s actions.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">It’s the Ultimate Web Graphics Course</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    The course begins simply enough with how to install the GIMP and then includes suggestions on selecting a user friendly HTML language editor. It ultimately leads you step-by-step through how to create each graphical element in the course and how to display those elements on a web page.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">This Course Is Not For The Absolute Beginner</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    This course assumes a glancing familiarity with the GIMP and HTML.  This is effectively an intermediate course on both topics.  If you’re ready, come with me on a graphical journey of discovery.  </p>",
