The WordPress website can be running on any local computer or one already set up by a web hosting company. Most people who take WordPress courses usually already have a WordPress site running, but in case you need one, students can download one for free at the WordPress downloads page and set it up using WordPress' <em>famous 5-minute installation</em><em></em>. I also have lectures showing students how to install a WordPress site in this course as well.</p><p>One other task that students need is either a LAMP setup on their local computer or one from one of the popular hosting companies who support WordPress.</p><p>Last, but not least, you simply need the desire to excel at WordPress and to become a super WordPress administrator.</p>",
