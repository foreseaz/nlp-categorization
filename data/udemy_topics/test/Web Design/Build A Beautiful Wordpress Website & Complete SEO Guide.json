Unlike the other courses that begin with a blank slate and build a site, I&#039;ll be taking more of a retrospective approach; taking you from finished product backwards. This style of learning is ideal for the visual learner that likes to see, then do. </p><p style=\"\">If you&#039;re like me and have a &quot;can do&quot; attitude, I will show you how to create a website that not only looks ultra-professional, but also ranks well in Google. I&#039;ll take you on a behind-the-scenes look at my website and show you the proven SEO methods I used to get there.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Here are some of the things you&#039;ll learn from this course:</strong></p><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"\">You will learn how to choose a stunning domain name.</li><li style=\"\">How to setup a hosting account.</li><li style=\"\">You will learn how to install Wordpress on your website.</li><li style=\"\">Choosing a theme that rocks!</li><li style=\"\">Step-by-step instructions to create pages and posts.</li><li style=\"\">How to use sliders and make your site visually amazing.</li><li style=\"\">What are plugins and which ones I recommend.</li><li style=\"\">How to integrate social media into your site.</li><li style=\"\">Behind the scenes look at my favorite SEO plugin and the settings I use.</li><li style=\"\">How to setup your e-mail</li><li style=\"\">Many, many more tips and tricks to add value.</li></ol><ul style=\"\"><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">More benefits of this course:</strong></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">No Coding</li><li style=\"\">No Prior Experience Required</li><li style=\"\">No knowledge of Wordpress, hosting, or FTP is necessary.</li></ul></ul><strong style=\"\">What are the requirements?</strong><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Internet connection</li><li style=\"\">Patience and Time</li><li style=\"\">The Avada Theme </li></ul><strong style=\"\">Who would benefit from the course?</strong><p style=\"\">If you&#039;re a small business owner, entrepreneur, or simply someone that&#039;s interested in having a killer website, you&#039;ll absolutely love this course. If on the other hand you have advanced knowledge of Wordpress and its inner workings, perhaps not so much.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"> The Bottom Line:</strong></p><p style=\"\">Listen, I&#039;ve been in your shoes. Intimidated. Overwhelmed. Clueless as to how to proceed. I can help you through this and you&#039;ll be glad you did. No, this isn&#039;t a course to make a website in one hour or even two. If you want a site that looks like you forked over $15k for, then you have to put in the time. If you&#039;ve got that, you can do this!</p>",
