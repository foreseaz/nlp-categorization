This course is ideal for people either wanting to have their own blog/website OR for people who want to acquire this skill in order to charge clients for website creation services. You will learn how to get a domain name, hosting services and choose a WordPress theme (the clothes on your website) along with modules on monetizing your site with ads and a place to collect email addresses. If you have a business, idea, blog or voice that needs to be heard.
