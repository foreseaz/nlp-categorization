Every Class. Every Video.</strong>  </p><p>  \t             I'm Evan Kopelson, creator of this site and 'Sensei' (teacher) of Ninja Blog Secrets. I'll be your guide in every class of this video training course, and you'll be watching me 'click by click' as I build a professional WordPress site, setup my blog, and integrate it with powerful online tools. I go at a nice, slow pace and explain everything as I'm doing it, so it'll be easy for you even if you are new online.  </p>  <p>  \t             Check out the description of the course modules below and read some of my client's reviews. You can even watch the first 4 videos, my entire Pre-Orientation Module, absolutely free. That is a full hour of content, free!  </p>  <p>  \t       You can get the course right here on this page. Just look for that blue button on the top right that says \"Take This Course.\"  </p>  <p>  \t    Click the blue button, make your payment, and I'll see you in class!  </p>  <p>  \t     -Evan, Your Sensei for Ninja Blog Secrets  </p>  <p>  \t         ------ Client Review -----  </p>  <p>  \tFanta-bulous resource!  </p>  <p>  \tI should have seen these video sessions long back. Evan Kopelson is indeed a master when it comes to Wordpress. I'm still half-way and I have already gained a tremendous insight into things which I have never thought about. Will update the review once I complete the course.  </p>  <p>  \t-by Knowledge Decoded! Shameer Mohammed  </p>  <p>  \t----- Client Review -----  </p>  <p>  \tAmazing course.  </p>  <p>  \tI already have installed wp on a couple of websites. I'm self taught and I had the idea that if my website loads on a browser, this was enough. Yet, I wasn't happy. Wordpress is really user friendly if you just want to post something quick online, but watching Evan starting from scratch really taught me I was doing many things the wrong way. From setting up email accounts, to how to choose a host, and get a domain with a different company so you may be able to get the best deal. Evan also goes over what are the pros and cons of all the available settings and plugins that wordpress has available. I already finished the class, but I find myself revisiting many of the lectures because the information and advice is really valuable. Evan also makes the videos entertaining, and easy to understand. I enjoyed learning a lot from this course :)  </p>  <p>  \t-Erick Sandoval  </p>  <p>  \t----- Client Review -----  </p>  <p>  \t          \"I used to find WordPress very difficult, but working with Evan I now have more confidence and knowledge. His clear explanations of why and how things are done have helped me tremendously.\"  </p>  <p>  \t         -Jackie Holl </p>  <p>  \t         ----- Client Review -----  </p>  <p>  \t          \"Evan is a great teacher and coach!  He always gives more value than I have ever paid for.  Evan consistently takes my ideas and expands them with his expertise in WordPress.

Each class runs between 3 minutes and 30 minutes. There are very few classes over 30 minutes long. A lot of the longer classes isn't harder work, it's just me explaining things carefully and going extra slowly so you won't get left behind if you're not totally comfortable with computers. It's up to you how long to take.  </p>  <p>  \t         ----- Client Review -----  </p>  <p>  \t          \"Evan was extremely helpful when I needed to figure out a couple of crucial things in WordPress before launching my last product. If you need guidance on building your WordPress site, Evan is the man!!!\"  </p>  <p>  \t        - Paul West </p>",
