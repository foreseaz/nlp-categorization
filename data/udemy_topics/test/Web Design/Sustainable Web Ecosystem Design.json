    "description": "<p>In our current media-rich environment a Web site is more than a collection of relative html documents of text and images on a static desktop computer monitor. We now have an unlimited combination of screens, devices, platforms, browsers, locations, versions, users, and exabytes of data with which to interact. Our mediated atmosphere surrounds us all of the time, and in nearly every place. It is an ecosystem that is part human, part hardware, and part software. A unique condition is upon us.&nbsp;</p><p>This class is all about a process of creating Web-based systems (ie, Web sites, content, etc.) that consider each of the parts, the modules, the organisms – binary or otherwise – that make up a balanced, sustainable Web ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Created and taught in a highly approachable, practical style, this class and the companion text book are highly relevant and practically useful for stakeholders, system administrators, developers, designers, content managers, and the anonymous Web user in industry and the same plus faculty, staff, and students of all levels involved in teaching and learning in information technology.</p><p>Each Week this course will include:</p><p></p><ol><li><span>Video lecture material to introduce each weeks&#039; topics.</span></li><li><span>A reading assignment from the required textbook.</span></li><li><span>A discussion question or two to get the students thinking on their own about the topics of the week and how they apply to the students&#039; own experiences, where applicable. This includes contact with the Professor as needed.</span></li><li><span>A hands-on assignment or quiz for further study of the topics when applicable.</span></li><li><span>Supplemental resources for further learning on the topics of the week.</span></li></ol><p></p>\r\n",
