All you have to do is repeat my actions, there is nothing more difficult than copying and pasting, so if you can do that - you can do this course.  </p>  <p>  \t Part 2 will then go on to discuss and teach you how to get your website looking how you&#039;d like it.  </p>  <p>  \t  Please let me know if there is anything unclear in the course discussion.  </p>  <p>  \t  Thanks for reading.  </p>",
