In addition to that, I have also included a discount coupon for HostGator.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course will also be updated in the near future to address any questions I receive and to further improve it based on your comments and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  \t  It is important to note that this course does not show you how to create a website, teach you HTML, Joomla, WordPress etc.  It just focuses on hosting your website.  </p>",
