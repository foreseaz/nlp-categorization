    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tIn this series, we jump into creating textures in ZBrush using polypainting. We&#039;ll examine the mesh and review references for the model and then we&#039;ll do a small exploration into matcaps and colors. We&#039;ll then begin to layer in a foundational skin tone before using the spray brush with an alpha to help create the imperfections usually found in skin. We&#039;ll use cavity masking to help us creating some shadowing and then the spray brush again to help give our demon head a five o&#039;clock shadow! We mock up some ideas for eye coloration before finally adding a base color to the horns to contrast with the skin of the demon!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  (Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)  </p>  <hr style=\"\">  <p style=\"\">  \t<u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">More about the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tStephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.
