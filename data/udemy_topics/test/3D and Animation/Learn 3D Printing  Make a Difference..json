    "description": "<p>  \t          In this course, you will learn HOW to use the amazing technology that is 3D Printing. We will be diving straight into useful and actionable material covering where to obtain 3D models, how to import them into software, how to slice the model, and how to finally make the 3D print. We will also cover troubleshooting and best practices for high quality prints.  </p>  <p>  \t        By taking this course you are also making a difference. 3D printing has the amazing capability to easily fabricate a physical product from nothing. In some areas of the world, this can be life changing. Project Daniel is an organization that 3D prints prosthetic arms for youth in South Sudan who have lost limbs in the ongoing conflicts.  When you purchase this course, 10% of its profits will be donated directly to Project Daniel, so that more youth can regain their independence and sense of self worth. Together we can help change lives.  </p>",
