    "description": "<p>In this course, we&#039;re going to jump into using MassFX to create a bone pile in 3ds Max. We&#039;ll use MassFX to set up animations simulating gravity on simple objects with general parameters and still end up with a bone pile that looks natural and based on real-world physics. Objects will interact with each other under specific parameters and will then collide with the &#039;ground&#039; and spread out into a pile that not only looks great but saves the 3D artist from having the tedious task of hand-placing each and every individual object into a pile and still make it look good. We&#039;ll examine dynamic versus kinetic versus static bodies and the way gravity affects each and then in our final example.</p><p>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</p><hr style=\"\"><p><u style=\"\">More about the Instructor:</u></p><p>Stephen Wells is an expert 3D modeler for characters, props, vehicles, weapons and environments and have created both high and low polygon assets for game productions.
