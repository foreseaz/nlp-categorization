We&#039;ll go step by step through the free modeling software Blender as we create our first model: a Bobblehead Robot.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You&#039;ll start by learning the basics of the Blender program. Then begin building your own Bobblehead Robot. You&#039;ll discover how to model to avoid printing problems that can pop up later. We look at how 3D printers work and I&#039;ll show you the printing of the Bobblehead Robot. When done you&#039;ll see the quick and easy assembly process.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  No experience necessary. My videos show you each mouse click and keystroke of the modeling process. I&#039;ll explain what I&#039;m doing and why I&#039;m doing it. Use the included illustrated PDF document as a ready reference.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  If you have a 3D Printer, have access to one or ever wondered what these amazing machines can do for you, <strong style=\"\">YOU NEED THIS COURSE</strong>.  </p>",
