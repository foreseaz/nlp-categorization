    "description": "<p>In this course, we will be learning the necessary skills to prepare and hand paint a 3D Creature for game production. Starting from the baking process, we will cover all the necessary skills that a texture artist will need to paint a character. After we get some of the technical parts out of the way the real fun can start: Painting. We will be covering techniques for painting in a very stylized color scheme, focusing on balancing values and colors to create a great looking creature. We will cover many materials from skin to metal, and showcase methods to make each material really sing. Our end result will be a final portfolio piece that shows off your painting prowess!</p><p><strong>(Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the source files associated with the lesson.)</strong></p><p><strong>More about the Instructor:</strong></p><p>An adopted son of San Francisco and the Academy of Art University, Ryan Ribot lives a small apartment with 3 cats and a Wacom.
