    "description": "<p>This course is for anyone who wants to learn a great \nworkflow for creating high quality 3D cartoon characters in zBrush. We \nwill cover all the basics and show you how you can take any drawing and turn it into a \nclean high end 3D model.</p><p>We will cover important \nsculpting techniques and I will show you how to properly paint your \nmodel inside zBrush. We will also take a look at some of the more \npopular brushes and alphas which you can use to add fantastic skin \ndetail and paint any design you want on your own character.</p><p>We\n will then learn how to pose our final character and take a quick look at how\n we can use layers to setup amazing facial expressions!</p><p>As the final step we will optimize our mesh, create texture maps for the elements that require it and bring it into Keyshot for a final beautiful render image. With this knowledge you will be able to export your high res models from zBrush into any 3d package for further lighting and rendering.<br></p>",
