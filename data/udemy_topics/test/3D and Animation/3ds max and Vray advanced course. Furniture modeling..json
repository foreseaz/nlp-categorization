After this training you’ll resolve all the questions in 3ds Max professional modeling and will be able to create 3d models of any kind of complexity. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">This training will be useful if you:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Make quality visualizations, but cannot model</li><li>Want to get rid of models libraries and learn how to make you own</li><li>Want to have an additional passive income from models sale on 3d stocks</li><li>Want to use quality 3d models in your projects</li><li>Want to learn how to make professional models in 3ds max</li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why should you use quality models in your projects?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With good models your projects will become more realistic and, consequently, better marketed. It wouldn’t always be so that free libraries will meet your requirements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At any time in your project can appear a piece of furniture, for example a sofa or a commode which is absent in the library or requires reworking. This training can be a real solution in this kind of problems, and in the end of it your works will come to a whole new level of professionalism.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Where can you find good models? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For quality commercial visualization you need to have a large library of ready 3d models. You can find them in the Internet, but as a rule free models have very poor quality and require reworking or even making the new ones, which can take you a lot of time. So you can either buy professional models, or create your own. </p>\n\n<p>If you are occupied in 3d visualization, modeling skills are necessary for you. In this training we’re going to sort through all the modeling types and create professional furniture models, which will complement any project. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to model objects in 3ds Max in a proper way</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While modeling complex objects, it’s necessary to understand the logic and to follow the certain modeling sequence. Even the good knowledge of a particular tool doesn’t guarantee the fact that you’ll be able to create a complex models in the right way. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mesh compliance will give you the possibility to edit model on at any stage, without the risk of textures displacement (UVW mapping). It’s one of the most important modeling rulesб which, unfortunately, many beginners do not consider it necessary to comply with and create wittingly defective models. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You’ll be able to make professional models and to sell them</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’re a lot of resources, where you can send your 3d models and receive passive income. But you have to learn how to model objects on the professional level for it. This course will help you to learn all the necessary modeling techniques in shortest terms and to begin getting profit.  </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">COURSE PROGRAM </strong></p>\n\n<p>The entire course system is structured in the way to fully cover all the modeling domains. We’ll divide this course in 5 main parts, and in each we’ll model complex armchairs. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">OCULUS CHAIR</strong> –on the example of this armchair you’ll learn how to convey a sense of soft leather in modern furniture. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">CHAIR CLUB CALEDONIAN</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this part we’ll train to model solid objects from metal or wood. We’ll also work at joint elements between these two materials. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">EJ BOW SOFA</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the example of this sofa we’ll deal with the texture of soft fabric furniture. We’ll work out the symmetry method and create an armchair from sofa. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">VERNER PANTONE</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this lesson we’ll consider the special smooth type creating the caption on armchair’s bend. </p>\n\n<h4><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What modeling techniques are we going to use?<br></strong></h4>\n\n<ul><li>Extrude, symmetry, turbo-smooth and high poly modifiers</li><li>Hard surface modeling</li><li>Studio render settings</li><li>V-ray material settings</li><li>V-ray render settings</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Bonus modeling techniques</strong></p><ul><li>Capiton modeling</li><li>Using the cut tool to model in wrinkles.</li></ul><p>During the whole course I’ll show you some special tricks with the help of which you can make your models more photorealistic and attractive. </p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">IMPORTANT</strong></p>\n\n<p>This course is fully refundable for 30 days. There is no risk to you in signing up for this course. Try it. If you hate it, get a refund.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Join the course right now!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\n\n</p><p><br></p>",
