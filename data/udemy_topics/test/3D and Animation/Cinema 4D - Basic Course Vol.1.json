    "description": "<p>This course is about 3D graphics with the aim to realize an animated video for the motion graphics field by using Cinema4D</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into it 2 rolling dices are took as instance to pass through the main production phases starting from scratch. So will be possible for beginners to know how to move into the 3D graphics field. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You don't have to be expert into the terminology: into the course there are specific command with really specific names, but the course is focused more on the workflows than the single command or the single software version, so you'll be able to apply all the acquired knowledge on any likewise contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is organized by videos and are available to download the textures used into the project.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To end the course, it is needed 1 week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course is divided in 2 main areas: the first show how to realize a static rendering, the second how to animate objects and build a video.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So the starting topics are related to modeling and texturing, to pass in time at rigging, animation curves and rendering of animated sequences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> The softwares used are:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> - Cinema4D: modeling, lighting, cameras, materials and animation.<br>- Photoshop, Mudbox: texturing<br>- After Effects, Premiere: Compositing and editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course will explain to you everything you need to create a 3D animation and, moreover, in the simplest way possible. So the final result is guarantee 100% and what you see, you'll get.</p>",
