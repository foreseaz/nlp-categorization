It covers basic cinematography, that's why it's free :D</strong></p><p><strong>The most common problem with amateur animations is that everything is covered from only one camera angle.</strong></p><p>That is because they either don't know other options, or because drawing the different angles of a character can be challenging.</p><p>One thing is certain:</p><p><strong>Good cinematography pulls the audience into the story.</strong></p><p>The objective of having awesome shots in your animation is to MAKE THE AUDIENCE FEEL. How can you call yourself an artist if you're not making your audience feel?</p><p>There are basic cinematography concepts ignored by many animators, and that is because in animation, the priority is to make a character come to life, which is the foundation, but once you have that, you need to be able to communicate in another level, a level that makes people happy if you want them to, or sad, or angry, or scared.</p><p>Good cinematography can make a dramatic scene even more dramatic, or a strong character look even stronger, or a weak character look weaker.</p><p><em>You can help to create tension between two characters, and also, you can help the audience feel more attached to one character than the other.</em></p><p>This 30 min course will explain the different concepts in cinematography.</p> <ul><li>Frame Compositions</li> <li>Rule Of Thirds</li> <li>Camera Angles</li> <li>Blocking Your Characters</li> <li>Dialogue Coverage</li> <li>Panning and Tilting in 2D</li> <li>Camera Movements</li> <li>Parallax</li></ul> <p><strong>And at the end of the course, you will learn how to bring everything together to improve a scene. </strong></p><p>You will see 3 versions of it.</p> <ol><li>The amateur version</li> <li>A More sophisticated version, which includes Over The Shoulder Shots</li> <li>The Best version that includes camera movements like push and pull.</li></ol> <p>This course will help animators improve their shots, making the audience feel something when they see the animation.
