You can find them under the \"Lecture 19's mat. tab\" [25.03.2016]<br><br>** I added three \"Wood Floor\" textures with bump files. You can find them under the \"Lecture19's material tab\" ** [13.02.2016]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>** Materials and textures are up to date. ** [10.10.2015]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>** The bonus lectures will be added soon. ** [20.09.2015]</strong></p>\n\n<p>        When you complete this training, you will be able to draw interior design plan with AutoCAD and you can model it on 3DS Max with very basic and practical methods in a few hours.<br></p>\n\n<p>          Then, we are going to design the scene we created by using free 3D models.  </p>\n\n<p>After doing the design process, we will set materials and textures. Then, we will look light settings and render customizations, we are going to have the final render with V-ray. </p>\n\n<p>You can achieve significant gains with a simple plan by customers which can not catch revive in mind according toAutocad and 2D hand drawings.   To see the Autocad project in 3D environment shall speed up your project. It can also help you to capture overlooked small details. I hope that you can reach a good level with this little course. I’m sure that how much you experience the best quality render you will get. I do this job fulltime at the office and get also freelance works.</p>\n\n<p>I will also add some bonus features.
