Interact with the course by trying to mimic the animation at the end of the basic animation and advanced animation sections. All the assets are included for you. All you have to do in import them and have fun! Best of all these assets were created by me and are free to use for any reason.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">How is the course structured?</strong>We will first go over what After Effects is and how animation works within it. Then we&#039;ll dive into the program and I&#039;ll go through the essential panels you&#039;ll be working with. Next we&#039;ll get into the animation and you&#039;ll be given a test project in which you are to mimic my design. Then I&#039;ll go through the process and you can check your work!</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Why take this course?</strong></p><p style=\"\">Because 1. Animation is incredibly rewarding and fun. 2. This is a great introduction to AE as well as the first step to creating animated explainer videos. 3. There&#039;s a bear singing on a stage with fog in the background.</p><p style=\"\">So jump on into animation. It&#039;s not as complicated as you think, and incredibly rewarding. </p>",
