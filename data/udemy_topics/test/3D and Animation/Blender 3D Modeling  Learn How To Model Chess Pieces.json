    "description": "<p>In this course you will be able to learn some modeling techniques in Blender. At the end of the classes you will be able to model all the chess pieces and apply materials and lighting necessary for the final result to be as realistic as possible. Do not worry if you are still new in blender, this course was properly produced so that you can keep up with all classes in detail. During this you will learn about modeling, texturing and a little bit about lighting, you will be able to create all the chess game pieces and the board (off course). All the images will be available for the student to a better understanding. You can quickly complete the course in one day. But for better learning i recommend that you, at least, try to create twice each piece.</p>",
