    "description": "<p>Congratulations\r\non your pregnancy! Many women have found prenatal yoga to be a great support\r\nthrough many of the changes that pregnancy brings.&nbsp;</p><p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\">This can be a very exciting\r\ntime but also a little overwhelming as you are figuring out how to take care of\r\nyourself and your growing baby at the same time. Whether this is your first or your\r\nfourth baby, self-care is an essential part of a healthy pregnancy! I have\r\ncreated this prenatal yoga class so you can receive all the benefits of yoga during your pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>What are\r\nthe benefits of prenatal yoga?</p>\r\n<p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\"><strong>• Builds strength and flexibility</strong> (to do the work of mothering)\r\n</p><p><strong>• Promotes proper posture, body awareness and\r\nhealthy alignment</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>• Reduces stress and promotes relaxation</strong> (good for mother and baby)</p>\r\n<p><strong>• Increases energy</strong> (growing a person is exhausting)</p>\r\n<p><strong>• Aids with focus</strong> (helps combat “fetal brain drain”)</p>\r\n<p><strong>• Promotes healthy circulation</strong>&nbsp;and reduces swelling</p>\r\n<p><strong>• Reduces or eliminates common pregnancy discomforts</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Prenatal yoga can help prepare body and mind\r\nfor childbirth.</strong> The\r\nprenatal yoga postures are specially designed to not only strengthen your body\r\nbut to build flexibility and openness – it is just as important to create suppleness so you can\r\nopen when the time comes to birth your baby. Birthing a baby requires both\r\ngreat effort and the ability to totally let go. We cultivate a balance of\r\neffort and surrender on the yoga mat so we can take it into\r\nlabor and birth.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Last but not least…</em></p>\r\n<p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\"><strong>Prenatal yoga promotes baby awareness!</strong> In the practice of yoga, you have the\r\nopportunity to acknowledge the presence of your baby, not as a package that\r\nwill arrive at some future date or that is “delivered” to you, but as a being that\r\nis here <em>now</em>. Yoga allows space to sit in the present moment, with yourself as\r\nwell as with your baby. <br></p><p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\"><strong><strong>This program can be done in its entirety or you can do one or more of the individual lectures.</strong></strong></p><p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\"><strong><strong></strong></strong>Enjoy the music of Sam Jackson&#039;s crystal bowls,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vibrantstillness.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.vibrantstillness.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;and Eric Fraser&#039;s lullabys&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ragabyebaby.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">ragabyebaby.com</a>&nbsp;. <br></p><p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\">\r\n\r\n</p><p class=\" PIN_1373064272642_hazClick\"><strong>Special note:</strong> It is very important for you to listen to your body. Take rest if\r\nneeded. Come out of any posture that causes strain or excessive discomfort.\r\nPlease exercise caution in the practice. If you experience dizziness, shortness\r\nof breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding\r\nor fluid leakage from your vagina or have history high blood pressure or any\r\nother serious medical condition, consult your midwife or doctor.
