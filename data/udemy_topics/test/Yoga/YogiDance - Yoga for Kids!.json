    "description": "<p>  \t In this YogiFit course with Miss Jessica kids will learn many yoga poses while pretending to be animals, practice hand eye coordination with games, and go on an Island  Adventure in the 30 minute class! Kids will learn our poem that we start  every class with to teach them what yoga is all about!  </p>  <p>  \t Our other short videos in this course teach them other yoga activities to practice on a day to day basis when they have a short amount of time!  </p>  <p>  \t In the 30 minute class we move through fun, imaginative yoga poses where  kids can pretend they are collecting treasure on an island, while going on a fun adventure and using yoga to tell the story. This class teaches  children many common yoga poses in a fun way, to keep them engaged.  </p>  <p>  \t Children will learn how to hula hoop in this video. They will practice balance with the hula hoop with fun activities.  </p>  <p>  \t Class ends with relaxation so children can learn to rest their bodies,  still their mind and breathe deeper. Relaxation also helps children to  have a few moments without stimulation to explore how they are feeling  internally.  </p>  <p>  \t Class ends with our rest poem to help children understand why they are relaxing.  </p>  <p>  \t YogiDance is a yoga-based exercise program for kids. We combine yoga,  hula hooping and teach relaxation in every class for the following  reasons:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Yoga improves balance, flexibility, and patience</li>  \t<li>Breath training develops healthy minds and improves focus and relaxation</li>  \t<li>Hula hooping and games burn calories and strengthen the abdomen</li>  \t<li>Non-competitive atmosphere Increases resilience and stress-coping capabilities</li>  </ul>  <p>  \tYogiDance provides children with a nurturing environment to build  self-confidence where no one loses and creativity is encouraged! Expect  your child to finish, happy, relaxed and ready for anything!  </p>  <p>  \t Miss Jessica teaches the class in this video, and there are no children in the video.  </p>  <p>  \t Children should not do yoga at least an hour after eating, and should wait 30 minutes after the class to eat.  </p>",
