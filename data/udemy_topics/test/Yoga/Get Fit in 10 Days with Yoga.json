    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      This course is designed to really build up your strength and fitness. We use the Sun Salutations from the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga system as well as strengthening and toning exercises for your core muscles. You don&#039;t need to have previous experience of Yoga to try it. However, if you have a Yoga practice already you&#039;ll find the core strengthening work will really help you in your poses - so it&#039;s suitable for everyone!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      In the introduction video Esther Ekhart (from <a href=\"http://www.ekhartyoga.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" style=\"\">www.ekhartyoga.com</a>) introduces the Sun Salutations and gives options if you need to make adjustments. The classes then build up gradually so that by the end of the course you will be able to do five Sun Salutation As and five Sun Salutation Bs. Each video includes deep core exercises and finishes with a relaxation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Each section includes a video of 30 minutes or less so you can fit it in to your daily schedule. You&#039;ll also find bonus material such as a more detailed look at the poses and a wonderful long relaxation for when you have a little more time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    We&#039;ve also included a free Detox Plan for the 10 days which you can either follow at the same time as the course for an extra cleanse, or use it on its own.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You can complete the course in 10 days but it&#039;s also fine to take longer if you want to build up more slowly. Simply repeat videos until they feel more comfortable or rest for a day in between each one.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      So let&#039;s Get Fit and Healthy!  </p>",
