    "description": "<p>  \t        Yoga Teacher Toolbox: Corrections &amp; Adjustments will give yoga teachers the information and confidence needed to provide effective aid to students during their classes. Teachers will learn how to determine if a correction is appropriate and how to provide that correction.  Giving corrections and adjustments to students will allow them to deepen their yoga practice and experience yoga in a new way. This course will also deepen its students&#039; (the yoga teachers) practice by demonstrating self-correction techniques and sharing insight into several poses.  </p>  <p>  \t        The course is divided into several sections. After the course introduction, it will address the overriding principles of giving corrections and adjustments.  Topics covered in this section will address areas such as getting to know the students and their backgrounds, using verbal and physical cues, finding a unique style of corrections, and developing the yoga teacherâ€™s confidence in this area.  Then, the course will provide several demonstrations for providing corrections and adjustments for standing, kneeling, seated, supine and prone yoga poses. Finally, the lessons help the yoga teachers experience the topic as yoga students.  Verbal instruction will help the course students get into the pose and experience the corrections themselves.  </p>  <p>  \t        Nearly all lectures will be in a video format with accompanying slides.  Demonstrations will be filmed with the teacher and a model so the students can see how the body can be adjusted during a yoga pose.  Finally, verbal instructions for self-correction will appear with a photo of the pose.  </p>  <p>  \t        While this course is designed for yoga teachers, yoga students will also benefit from the content.  Anyone with basic yoga experience will find that they can deepen their practice by going into poses and making corrections to increase the effectiveness of those poses. The course contains 26 lessons, and each one is 5-10 minutes. There are also 3 downloadable resources with information to supplement the course.  </p>",
