Under stress a hormone called cortisol is released which hinders the functioning at neurotransmitters making it harder for brain cells to talk to each other. This makes it difficult to think clearly and is the reason why we get confused in a crisis or a stressful situation. This also directs blood glucose or energy away from the brain. Knowing how stress affects brain brain, one would think the solution is to simply force to mind. Unfortunately, the mind has a terrible time telling itself what to do.</p><p>Many of us are familiar with the consequences of stress in our body such as headaches, depression etc. But do you know how it mainly affect us in various ways?<br></p><p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Body      </strong></p>  <ul><li>Headache                                  </li><li>Muscle tension or pain</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Stomach upset</li><li>Sleep problems</li></ul>            <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>  <ul><li>Overeating or under eating</li><li>Angry outbursts</li><li>Drug or alcohol abuse</li><li>Tobacco use</li><li>Social withdrawal</li></ul>          <p><strong>Mood</strong></p>  <ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Restlessness</li><li>Lack of motivation or focus</li><li>Irritability or anger</li><li>Sadness or depression</li></ul>          <p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>So what is the solution to this problem? – Yoga (Proper Breathing Technique)</strong> </p>  <p> A solution to effectively managing stress and calming the mind can be found in a more tangible tool- BREATHING because there is a direct link between breathing and emotions. In other words, we can control our emotions through breathing. Improper breathing techniques may lead to improper emotions which in turn lead to the above listed effects.</p>  <p>We don’t get any results in a day. Even if you go to gym, there are certain protocols which need to be followed such as proper workout plan, nutrients intakes per day etc.  Similarly, effects of yoga will be seen only if you follow certain guidelines like</p><ul><li>Try to avoid intake of non- veg food, smoking, alcohol and tea/coffee as far as possible</li><li>Try to keep yourself away from negative people</li><li>Help at least one needy every day. </li><li>Practice this yoga everyday in the morning(most preferably) without fail </li></ul><p>Don't wait for all others to meditate and then you imitate\nthem. Be a YOGI. Start meditating and inspire others.<br></p><p>A flower doesn't need to draw more efforts to prove its fragrance, it just automatically purifies the environment wherever it goes. Similarly, a yogi automatically spreads happiness and make purifies the environment.</p><p>I guarantee that you will feel the difference in your behavior within weeks. If not, we have got 30 days money back guarantee. </p><p>Any questions, feel free to leave the comment in the forum<br></p><p><br></p>        <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>",
