I have tried different styles of yoga over the years, but I am finding that Yin yoga is best suited for me. The long extended poses work muscles and joints in a deep, yet safe fashion and allows a restorative meditation to soothe the nerves and release tension. Kassandra is a wonderful teacher. She explains the poses with a relaxing voice and says just enough. I find instructors who speak all the time quite distracting. I recommend this course highly and I expect to continue using it in the months to come.\"<strong> </strong><em>-- Tom Daddesio</em><strong></strong></p><p>“Super easy to follow instruction - Great relaxing voice and music - Awesome poses that are really effective and easy to do - Duration of the videos are perfect! (In person classes here are 1hr 15 which is wayyy too long for me. I love that this is shorter.) I couldn't be happier. Thanks so much for putting this course together!!! You've done an amazing job.\" <em>-- Max Imus</em><strong> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p><p><strong>Downloadable Content and Free Bonus Included</strong></p><p>Each video lesson is downloadable so you can put them on your tablet or smart phone.
