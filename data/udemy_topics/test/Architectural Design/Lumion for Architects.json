    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Lumion is a powerful tool for architects, landscape architects and other designers and is making its way into more and more studios and offices. The ease of the interface and workflow within this software along with the ability to make 3D models from a variety of software programs look fantastic makes Lumion great resource to have.</span>  </p>  <p>  \t      While almost anyone can pick up Lumion and learn the basics, there are also more advanced techniques that some users aren&#039;t even aware of. In Lumion for Architects we approach this software with the expectation that you will learn the basics along with a few tricks that will really take your renders and animations to the next level including the grid technique that allows construction phasing and other animations, time lapse videos and how to use advanced move for technical animations.  </p>  <p>  \t      One of the best parts about this course is that the 3D models are available as part of the course work. You can join Sam step-by-step as you assemble the same museum that you will see in the instructional videos and he even shows you how you can show off your final render with the world.  </p>  <p>  \t      While this course is designed with an architect in mind, it will be valuable for anyone trying to get the most out of Lumion. As a matter of fact, while Sam owns his own 3D visualization studio, he is an engineer by trade rather than an architect. (If you are an architect, no hard feelings... right?)  </p>  <p>  \t      We look forward to you joining us in Lumion for Architects!  </p>",
