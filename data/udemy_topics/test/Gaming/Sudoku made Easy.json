    "description": "<p style=\"\">Sudoku is a popular puzzle game much like a crossword puzzle. Sadly, many people who feel they are not good at math are put off from playing this wonderful game due to the fact that it contains numbers. Sudoku does NOT require any Math skills to play, rather it is a game of logic that can improve your cognitive skills and help your memory.</p><p style=\"\">In this course I will show you how to play Sudoku and solve puzzles using simple and logical techniques. I will show you how to use basic scanning and cross-hatching methods to solve easy to medium level puzzles, moving on to more challenging puzzles using the “candidates” or “pencil mark” method.</p><p style=\"\">Each lecture focuses on a particular solving technique along with examples. Download and print the example puzzles and follow along as I show you how to use your new-found skills to solve a puzzle from start to finish. Then practice your skills using the downloadable practice puzzles in each section.</p><p style=\"\">After learning some basic and advanced solving techniques we will take a look at some variations of the game, from 3D Sudoku that can be solved using basic techniques to Killer Sudoku which actually requires some basic arithmetic skills.</p> Whether you have never played Sudoku before or are a regular player looking for new techniques this course is for you!",
