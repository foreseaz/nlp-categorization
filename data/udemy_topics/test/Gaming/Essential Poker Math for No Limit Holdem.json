I have often wondered how much maths are involved in poker but have never bothered to investigate this. When I saw this course on Udemy I immediately thought that is a must for me as I was one of these guessing Poker players. Having watched a lot of poker on various TV channels in the UK Some of them have said , \"you don't need to know much maths to be reasonable.\" So I watched a couple of episodes from them which covered the the rudimentary's but having watched this course now I have realised that I was playing with both hands tied behind my back. I am now itching to do more of Altons courses and then possibly getting some tuition from him in the very near future. Top course Alton!\" – Keith </em></p>\n\n<p><strong>POKER MATH IS EASY TO LEARN</strong></p>\n\n<p>Poker math is a vitally important aspect to No Limit Hold'em, but it is often overlooked or simply not used because many poker players fear it is too difficult to learn.
