    "description": "<p>This course is about getting you to solve the most famous puzzle in the world, Rubik&#039;s cube. If you tried to solve it in the past and failed, worry not...I am here to guide you step by step through my unique method.</p><p>I believe anyone can solve the cube if he learned it like I did, that is learn a few moves and then practice it for a day, and then a few moves and so on, and that&#039;s exactly what I will be doing with you.</p><p>As the title says, you will learn to solve the cube in 4 days... but that does not mean you will be FAST in a week! NO, it will take you some time depends on how much you practice, to solve the cube in 3 minutes or less,and you will learn in a way that will enable you to memorize all the steps in 4 to 7 day.</p><p>So why take this course? Because it&#039;s unique, it&#039;s simple, and I don&#039;t use the cube&#039;s notes.</p>",
