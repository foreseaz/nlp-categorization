    "description": "<p>Imagine you have come to a shop to purchase a mobile phone. The shopkeeper gives you a phone with 10 books on how it works and how to use it.</p><p>The same process is followed in chess learning. There’s a huge difference between knowledge and skill. For example, you can read thousands of books about martial arts, but it doesn’t mean that you’ll become a great fighter. Apart from information, you need to train and acquire necessary practical skills. This is true just as much for chess.</p><p>That is why, in these seminars, GM Smirnov provides you with a very small user’s manual that has several items you can follow, one by one, to understand chess clearly.</p><p>Course Content:</p><p>The seminar covers four major lectures with practical suggestion. In each lecture, GM Igor Smirnov answers all students' questions and provides additional tips to implement in their games.</p><p>1. Time to Win</p><p>2. Right\nthinking in chess</p><p>3. Smirnov\nGambit</p><p>4. Art\nof Planning</p><p>The course contains around 100 minutes of video lessons and a PDF summery for every seminar topic.</p>",
