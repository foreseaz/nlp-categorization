Trust me, being just as smart or smarter than everyone else in your league make it way more fun :)</p><p>This class won't bore you with every last detail of unnecessary information, this class covers exactly what you need to know and nothing else. </p><p>All you need is a basic understanding of football, a notepad of some sort and 1 hour.</p><p>You will wonder why you ever even played fantasy football without this knowledge. Don't let another day go by. Take an hour and start having fun playing this game again. And have fun winning!</p>",
