    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t In this course, we take you through the process of setting up a complex - but visually stimulating - particle system that warps a character in through a teleportation device, as well as an amazing look at &quot;phasing&quot; the character in to view! We&#039;ll look at creating the holographic projections you see in the scene, adding texture and distortion to the sequence, and then wrap up the series with an in-depth look at setting up a basic render and animating the camera and lights so that you can make your very own cut-scenes and cinematics!  </p>  <hr style=\"\">  <p style=\"\">  \t<u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Bill has worked in the games industry for over 7 years specializing in Realtime VFX.
