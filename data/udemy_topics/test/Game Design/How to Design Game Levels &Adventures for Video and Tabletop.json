(Level design is a subset of game design.) There is no instruction in using specific software, for example, but a lot about what to put in the level (and not put in it).  Adventures (for D&amp;D) preceded video game levels, and levels follow the same principles as those adventures.  </p>  <p>  \t         In games that require episodes (stages, missions, levels, adventures), the episode designer is the person who delivers the enjoyment to the players.  </p>  <p>  \t                        Entire books have been written about level design, though much of the material in these books describes how to manipulate a specific level editor such as Unreal III.  There&#039;s not so much in these books about the actual <strong style=\"\">design</strong> of levels/adventures.  This course is strictly about <strong style=\"\">design</strong>, not production, though we do discuss documentation.  </p>  <p>  \t      Udemy says the course is 8 hours.  It&#039;s actually half that, they count as four hours the file I supply that contains all the slides used in the videos.</p>",
