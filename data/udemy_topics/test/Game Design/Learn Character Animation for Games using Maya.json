Here he shows us how to create a walk cycle, run cycle, hit reaction animation, and a simple traversal animation while either animating from scratch, using reference, or a combination of both.    The pre-rigged character is also available as part of the course for you to practice with! (Students - please look under Section 1 / Lecture 1 downloads for the character to use with the lesson.)  </p>  <hr style=\"\">  <p style=\"\">  \t <u style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">More about the Instructor:</strong></u>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Justin Harrison is a Character and Technical Animator with more than 7 years experience in the game development industry.
