    "description": "<p>  \t Let&#039;s face it, most history textbooks are as dry as a mouth full of saltine crackers. This problem has left thousands of people without a solid grasp of the events of American history. Well it&#039;s time to stop wrestling with those tiresome texts and time to pick up your tablet!  </p>  <p>  \t My course is a digitally forward-thinking account of the origins of the American Revolution, the events that led up to the war, the key players and major battles, and how it affected America&#039;s future. The course is meant to be accessible to both students and adults and will bring American history to life in a way that will help you excel not only on tests, but at your friend&#039;s dinner parties as well!  You should take this course because not only does it utilize a visual mix of HD video, pictures, and sound effects, but it is broken down into bite-sized chunks that are humorous, informative, easily digestible, and don&#039;t take too much time out of your day. Get familiar with one of the most pivotal moments in our nation&#039;s history in a fun and lively manner.  </p>",
