    "description": "<p>This course is an adventure!  It is a series of video/slide presentations (\"mashups\") which will take you through the splendor of ancient Egypt: before pharaoh and the origins of state; the fascinating theology of ancient Egypt and a sampling of the gods which drove those beliefs; the evolving symbolism of the pyramid and the functions of the myriads of temples found up and down the Nile.  The eternal importance of the rites of mummification and the compelling pharaohs of renown from the 18th through the 20th dynasties: Hatshepsut (the woman who would and was king); the mighty Thutmosis III; the monotheistic Akhenaten and his son, Tutankaten, better known as Tutankhamun, and others.  Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this course is the exposure to Middle Kingdom hieroglyphics and the unusual and rare challenge of learning the basics of translation.  Take the beginning steps along the path of becoming an ancient scribe!  Ten days is the approximate time it should take to complete this class.</p><p>Join me for this great and enjoyable adventure!</p>",
