    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t        Why a course on learning the Bible?  I mean, it&#039;s only a book - just read it, right?  Not right.  Many have tried to learn it without any help and fallen into the same traps.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        The traps keep people from right understanding of God and His ways, and they can point people in a very wrong direction.  Many strange religious beliefs and practices have been birthed from wrong Bible interpretation, but it doesn&#039;t have to happen.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This course will help you avoid the traps altogether and leap far ahead of most in understanding God and His Word.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        I&#039;ve included sections on the framework for all Bible understanding, the rules of Bible interpretation, how to choose a translation and the differences of each, and the different types of Bible study.  Also, I&#039;ve taken some key passages of misunderstanding and given clarification as an example of avoiding wrong doctrine.  There is a section on suggested resources to complement your Bible study.  And finally, I&#039;ve included a Books of the Bible summary, where I give a brief expose on every book of the Bible.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This video course is designed to ignore the boring, unnecessary approach that one would get at a seminary, and take you right into things that help with life-application of the Bible - for YOUR life. And some of the material is taken directly from live teaching sessions.  </p>",
