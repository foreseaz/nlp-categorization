Throughout the past two thousand years, these two lands, though separated by the Irish Sea, have nonetheless shared many triumphs and woes.  The course will provide a basis for students to understand the complex relationship between these two Celtic nations.  Foundations of the Gael begins this story with the rise of Celtic culture in ancient Europe.  Fundamentals of the Celtic world will be exposed and analyzed through classical sources like the Romans as well as traditional myths and legends that reveal more than most people think.  The course is organized into two parts with seven lectures and a quiz in each part.  This equates to nearly an hour and a half of content in the lectures themselves.  </p>",
