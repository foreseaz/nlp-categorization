    "description": "<p>  \t        These lectures concentrate on the wisdom behind the greatness of Ben Franklin.  This is a video course with valuable supplemental materials about Franklin&#039;s life and work. We detail f Franklin&#039;s relationship to Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, facts which are left out of conventional history and biographies of his life.  We also discuss Franklin&#039;s attitude about Reincarnation and Christianity and why he was not a Deist.  Without this &quot;secret&quot; information it is hard to see how our country can continue to prosper.   The course should take about a week to complete.  Anyone with a curious and open mind will gain a great deal of personal wisdom as to what is possible in life to know and achieve.  </p>",
