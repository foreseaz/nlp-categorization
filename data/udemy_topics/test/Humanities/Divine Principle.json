    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t               Everyone is struggling to attain happiness and avoid misfortune. People feel joy when their desires are fulfilled. But within  the self-same individual are two opposing desires: the original mind,  which desires goodness, and the evil mind, which desires wickedness. They are engaged in a fierce battle, striving to accomplish two  conflicting purposes. Any being possessing such a contradiction within  itself is doomed to perish.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t          This course explores the cause behind those conflicting purposes from an integrated understanding between science and religion. It provides answers to questions such as: why bad things happen to good people and what is the nature of God.  </p>",
