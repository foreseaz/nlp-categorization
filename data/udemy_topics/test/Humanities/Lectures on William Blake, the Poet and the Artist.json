    "description": "<p>\r\n\t Providence eLearning English Professor William Lasseter analyzes William Blake’s &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; and &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; along with several additional poems and paintings. Published first in 1789, Songs of Innocence revealed one half of a two part thesis by Blake on the state of human perception. Blake saw the world as composed of two contrary and complementary states, calling them respectively “Innocence” and “Experience”. &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; was bound together with &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; and printed in 1794. In it Blake sets forth the second part of his two part thesis on human perception.\r\n</p>",
