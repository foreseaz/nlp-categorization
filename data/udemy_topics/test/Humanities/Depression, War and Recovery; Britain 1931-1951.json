    "description": "<p>This course leads you on a unique learning journey through some of the most eventful years in Britain's entire history. From the hunger strikes of the 1930's to the Blitz of the 1940's to the establishment of the welfare state by the 1950's, this course covers it all. </p>\n\n<p>Each video lecture contains a detailed analysis of each event within its historical context - this is not just a regurgitation of well known facts. The course explores some lesser known incidents in depth such as the Jarrow Crusade or the post war Nationalisation of major industry. Through quizzes and other suggested activities, there is also the opportunity to assess your own learning as you go. The course will take between 2 and 3 hours to complete in its entirety. </p>\n\n<p>I'm passionate about this period of History being British myself and I know that I bring that enthusiasm for this incredibly interesting period into each section of the course. I look forward to welcoming you as a new student!</p>",
