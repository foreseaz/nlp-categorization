If that is what you are looking for, don't even bother continue reading, let alone take this course. </p>\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Mistakes To Avoid in LAW SCHOOL </em>is a condensed class addressing important mistakes made by law school students. Not mistakes on exams, but behavioral, psychological, and time management mistakes.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>This prep course takes a holistic approach.</strong> This is very unique in the world of prep courses. This course wants to inform future law students about issues, not law. Future law students should learn about the environment, beneficial habits, psychology, time-management, attitude, and the social aspects of law school, NOT about contracts and torts. Future law students can more realistically be taught how to improve their habits so they succeed in law school. </p>\n\n<p>The Modern 1L LLC material <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">HAS WORKED FOR MANY LAW STUDENTS</strong>. The information in this class is not the opinion of one person, but many, and published in <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Modern 1L LLC Performance Manuscript</em>. The Modern 1L LLC has conducted interviews with former law students, law professors, judicial clerks, undergraduate law instructors, and current law students. Studies in psychology, test taking, and performance have been examined. The culmination of this work was <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Modern 1L LLC Performance Manuscript</em> and now, this condensed class. </p>\n\n<p>The Modern 1L LLC is <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">NOT A NEW COMPANY</strong>.  The Modern 1L LLC is fairly new to Udemy, but has operated for going on five years.  <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Bonus Materials</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course gives you excerpts from <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Modern 1L LLC Performance Manuscript. </em>The following chapters are included:  </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>\"Classroom Preparation\" (6 pages)</li><li>\"Sleep Issues in Law School\" <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> </em>(6 pages)</li><li>\"Exercise\" (6 pages)</li><li>Full dialogue of each lecture.
