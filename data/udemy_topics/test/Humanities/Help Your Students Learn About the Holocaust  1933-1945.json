    "description": "<p style=\"\">When most people think about the Holocaust, they ask why and how such an event could occur in a &quot;civilized&quot; country in modern times--particularly a genocide with such scope and handled with such precision. This course covers the how and why the Holocaust happened, touching on the key events, perpetrators and dates of the period. As this is an overview course, various in depth topics will be saved for future courses. Some of the course will also be student-led, meaning topics students would like to discuss will be brought up during Live Sessions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">This course is self-paced, making it ideal for those who have work, school or family&nbsp;commitments that may make it difficult to keep up with another course layout.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">The class is tailored for non-historians or people without an extensive working knowledge of WWII or the Holocaust. People who fall under that category may want follow my facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/AnnaScanlon) to keep informed of further classes that go into more detail.</span></p><p style=\"\">This course is live, so it is always growing and changing!</p><p style=\"\">If you have a course you are interested in taking regarding the Holocaust, please do not hesitate to email me. Future courses may include, but are not limited to:</p><p style=\"\">Anne Frank and the Holocaust</p><p style=\"\">Children/Teens and the Holocaust (a course specifically for children and teens)</p><p style=\"\">Teaching the Holocaust</p><p style=\"\">Film/Theatre and the Holocaust</p><p style=\"\">Non-Jewish Holocaust victims</p><p style=\"\">France and the Holocaust</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Two Ground Rules of the Course:</strong></p><p style=\"\">Please be aware that this course does <strong style=\"\">NOT </strong>discuss the politics of the nation of Israel. Its founding is briefly touched on at the end of the course, but a debate about Israel&#039;s current politics, or any politics post-1940s is not relevant to the course material. If you wish to discuss this, there are many other courses and platforms for you to do so.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">Holocaust denial or revision (i.e. there were no gas chambers) is <strong style=\"\">NOT </strong>tolerated in this course. There are plenty of other places to discuss such conspiracy theories. This class operates on the scholarly notion that the Holocaust actually took place.</p><p style=\"\">Failure to comply with the above may result in being removed from the course.</p><p style=\"\">Thank you for your cooperation.&nbsp;</p>  ",
