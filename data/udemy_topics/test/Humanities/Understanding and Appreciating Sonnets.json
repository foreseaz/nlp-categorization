    "description": "<p>\r\n\t    One of the oldest and most powerful forms of poetry, the Sonnet is brought to life in this course. Consisting of 14 lines and a variable rhyme scheme, some of the worldâ€™s greatest poets have used the sonnet to discuss matters close to the heart and home. This collection explores the various styles in some of the finest examples of the sonnet form. Providence eLearning has provided more than two hours of video lectures throughout the course which help to explain the meaning behind these works. Each sonnet is narrated by William Lasseter and includes a review question to check your understanding.\r\n</p>",
