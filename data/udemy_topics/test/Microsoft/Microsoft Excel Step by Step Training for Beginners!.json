They do more good than you may know. Considering this was your first course, I can&#039;t wait in anticipation for your next course. When you retire, I hope you consider entering the teaching profession. You have a rare gift!</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Vern Reo </strong>This course is extremely well done for those who haven&#039;t a clue when it comes to Excel. The instructor covers a lot of ground in a well-structured and simple teaching style. I&#039;m only 40% through this course and can already perform most tasks I&#039;ll ever need for my job. I highly recommend this course. </li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Diana T </strong>Engaging, positive course. I am going through the course now, and the more I advance, the more confident I feel when using Excel daily at work, Jed really has the right attitude towards this course and his students, and does a great job at boosting people&#039;s confidence! Thank you, Jed! </li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Jose Lopez Garcia </strong>Awesome course for Beginners. I was a complete beginner before taking this course - no more! After several days looking for a good course on Excel, I decided to purchase Jed&#039;s. Jed gives specific and very clear explanations throughout the course. And he always supported me with all of my questions! The overall production quality is just excellent. Thanks Jed for such a professional course! </li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Brenda Florence Jarolímková </strong>Short, but simple and effective! I really enjoyed this one because it starts with things I was able to catch up quickly with and yet felt that this is going to be useful in the future.
