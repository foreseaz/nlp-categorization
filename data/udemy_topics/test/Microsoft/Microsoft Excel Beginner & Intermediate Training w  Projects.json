YAY! Ryan and I are super excited to have you here, we’re honored that you’ve taken a minute out of your day to read this far.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Excel is an amazing application. You can do fun and important things with Excel. Whether you’re working in finance, consulting, non-profits, or even still in school, Microsoft Excel is the industry standard for organizing, analyzing, manipulating, and storing data in tabular form.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Learn Excel?</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Excel is the world’s most popular spreadsheet program. Learning it can be frustrating (or at least it was for me). \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you have a small business, and you need to learn Excel for tracking your sales. Maybe you want to work at a startup, boutique marketing firm, or investment bank... Maybe you're a recent graduate apply for an analyst job at a Fortune 500,,,, Or maybe you're like me and you want to be able to do more in less time, perhaps get a raise or job promotion.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing how to use Excel to solve real-world problems can be an awesome tool to help differentiate you from the competition!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this Course:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Excel takes time, particularly if you try to do it without any structure!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, we'll talk you through the basics from how to create a spreadsheet, to how to sort and filter your data in tables, even create charts and use awesome tools like Sparklines and Flash Fill!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this training course, we’ve broken down Microsoft Excel into ten main sections:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Getting Started with Excel 2013</li><li>Entering Data</li><li>Formulas and Functions</li><li>Formatting &amp; Presenting Data</li><li>Database Features</li><li>Using Tables</li><li>Charts &amp; Graphs</li><li>Modifying &amp; Adjusting Data</li><li>Using Special View Features within Workbooks</li><li>Managing Worksheets within a Workbook</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About our approach:</strong>\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We want you to succeed!

Watch a video, and then go off and tinker with your own workbooks. Maybe you like following along. Open up your spreadsheet, and move through each lesson step-by-step with us. Maybe you just want to learn about the sorting feature within Tables, well then jump right to lecture 64!
