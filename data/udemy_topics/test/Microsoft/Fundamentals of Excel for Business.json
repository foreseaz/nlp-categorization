    "description": "<p>This course covers fundamental concepts in spreadsheet modeling with Microsoft Excel for business by Dr.Ramesh Sankaranarayanan, Associate Professor of Business at the University of Connecticut (UConn).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is designed to help Business School students (undergraduate and MBA) as well as practicing managers and executives become more effective users of excel spreadsheets. All concepts are explained using business examples demonstrated via short videos. Each video is classroom-tested and explains the main concepts as well as things to watch out for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each video lesson is designed to be self-contained: you can view the video and work on the spreadsheet without referring to other videos. Supplementary materials include one “before” and one “after” excel file. For best results, you should download the “before” file, follow along with the video, and compare your completed spreadsheet with the “after” file.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing this course you should have the fundamental concepts necessary to use Excel successfully in your workplace or school. While this course uses Excel 2010 to illustrate the concepts, you can apply these concepts in Excel 2007 or 2013 as well.</p>\r\n",
