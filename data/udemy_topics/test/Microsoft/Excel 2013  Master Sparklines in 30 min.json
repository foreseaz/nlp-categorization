Well then Sparklines are for you.  </p>  <p>  \tYou can add these pattern identifying graphs for each range of data in just one cell. This will help your audience analyze the trend, while they&#039;re witnessing the data.  </p>  <p>  \tSparklines is a relatively new concept for Excel users. Therefore, I have designed this course to divulge the basics of Sparklines and Sparkline Groups. Once you&#039;re up to speed with the basic, the second section discusses the advanced features offered by sparklines. At the end of that section, I assure, you&#039;ll be able to use any basic or advanced feature, any which way!  </p>  <p>  \tShall we begin!!!  </p>",
