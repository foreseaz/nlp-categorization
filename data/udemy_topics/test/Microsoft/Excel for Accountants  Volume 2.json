My online Excel University courses teach the content of the books in video format. Now, for Udemy, I&#039;ve combined the book text and the lecture videos of Excel University Volume 2 and made them both available in this Excel for Accountants Volume 2 course.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>    Course Format  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      Each course section will begin with the lecture video. You can work through the sample Excel file to practice. Each section also provides the text of the book which reinforces and enhances the content presented in the lecture video. I then provide additional resources and related Excel University blog posts and articles. These elements provide an effective training experience.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Instructor</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Author and award-winning instructor, Jeff Lenning, is a certified public account and Microsoft certified trainer, and has helped thousands of accountants use Excel more efficiently.  </p>",
