No previous knowledge is needed as the basics are covered.</p><p style=\"\">The Student will need a desktop of laptop computer with Microsoft Excel installed to get the best out of the course.</p><p style=\"\">The course takes about 10 hours to complete if you just want to watch the videos but (and this is a big but) this is definitely not the approach that i encourage. Instead, the student is advised to download the Excel workbooks that i have included in the course and use them to follow through the videos with. This would give the student the hands-on approach that is most needed and in doing so get the best out of the course. This approach would take 10 days approximately. Remember the old saying that: The best teacher is practice.</p><p style=\"\">I have broken down the course into summation, string, logical and statistical functions.</p><p style=\"\">Understanding Excel Functions is the heart-beat to becoming a top level Data Analyst or Excel Developer</p>",
