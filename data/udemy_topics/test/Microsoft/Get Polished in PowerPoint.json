Don't let insights you've discovered get lost in a maze of mediocre slides.  </p>  <p>  \t                    In this 90-minute primer you'll go from slide monkey to slide master. We'll take an accelerated 'learn-by-doing' approach: picking up where we left off in <em>Use Excel Like a Pro. Fast.</em><em>,</em> we'll design a PowerPoint template, write a storyboard and craft a polished presentation. Along the way, we'll unpack the principles of great slide writing and cover time-saving shortcuts.  \t  \t<strong>What makes this course different?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                          - It's <strong>practical</strong>. The instructor has worked in management consulting for eight years. That's a lot of real-world experience to share  \t                    - It's <strong>fast</strong>; only 90 minutes. You'll have what you need in no time  \t                    - It uses the <strong>case-method</strong> pedagogy. By teaching in the context of an example, retention is far higher than a traditional approach  </p><p><strong>Discounts?</strong></p><p>Check out Kieran's blog for periodic coupon codes</p>",
