Total session time is approximately 1 1/2 hours of training.&nbsp; The course is structured so that you can choose which section is most important for your situation.&nbsp; I recommend you start at 1 and continue through sequentially. But, depending on your current job,  you may need to jump right into Charting - Course 2. (Come back to 1, though, get your solid foundation in place.)<br style=\"\"></p>  ",
