This means that you do not have to format the cells manually and you can <strong>let Excel do all the work for you! </strong>Also<strong>, if there is change in the data Excel will automatically change the formatting</strong>, if the cell will now meet a different criteria.<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tMost frequently I use <strong>conditional formatting to allow me visualize the data</strong>, meaning that I can start analyzing the data before even looking at the values themselves. This means that you can <strong>increase your productivity working with Excel to a high degree using conditional formatting.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tYou can <strong>preview the introduction lectures</strong> in order to see <strong>some of the applications of conditional formatting</strong> in order to get a better understanding how it can be used.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>About this course:</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tIn this course I show everything <strong>step-by-step</strong>, meaning that I will be showing each single button that I press. By doing this I want to make sure that <strong>you memorize all the steps</strong> and <strong>can apply conditional formatting in your own Excel spreadsheets.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tThis course is designed for a <strong>beginner/intermediate level.</strong> You need to have Excel fundamentals, meaning that you will have to know how to open an Excel file, save it and other similar fundamentals. However, you do <strong>not need to have an advanced knowledge of Excel.</strong> The most advanced part of this course is when I will be teaching you to use formulas to make a condition. However, I will <strong>explain each formula </strong>in depth, meaning that you <strong>do not have to worry that you will not understand it.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tHowever, if you are an advanced Excel user, you might still want to go through the course in order to refresh your knowledge and possibly learn a couple of new tips.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>By the end of this course you will be able to:</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<li>Become more productive with Excel and save time</li>  \t<li>Enhance the data analysis capabilities with conditional formatting</li>  \t<li>Learn how to use conditional formatting</li>  \t<li>Perform multiple conditional formatting rules to the same group of cells</li>  \t<li>Use conditional formatting to highlight group of cells</li>  \t<li>Use conditional formatting top and bottom rules</li>  \t<li>Use conditional formatting icons to highlight cells</li>  \t<li>Use conditional formatting based on text rather than simply numbers</li>  \t<li>Learn how to use formulas in conditional formatting</li><li>Create various custom rules using formulas</li><li>Edit existing conditional formatting rules</li>  \t<li>Impress your manager, colleagues and clients</li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Other benefits from taking this course:</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<li>You will get <strong>lifetime access </strong>to this course</li>  \t<li>This course <strong>is frequently reviewed</strong> and you will get access to the <strong>new lectures for free</strong></li><li><strong>Unconditional      Udemy 30 day money-back guarantee </strong>- that's my      personal promise of your success!</li>  \t<li><strong>My help is available to      you,</strong> if you get stuck or have a question</li><li>I will provide you discounted coupon codes for my other Excel courses</li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong><em>Click the “Take this course\" button at top right corner.
