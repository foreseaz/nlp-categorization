    "description": "<p>  \t      In this course I will teach you some of my techniques for editing modern day Pin-up images into classic looking vintage style portraits.  We will cover many of the tools and editing capabilities found within Photoshop.  <br>  \t<br>  \t      In Section 1 - I discuss the history and art style of the original American Pin-up artists.  </p>  <p>  \t  In Section 2 - I show you exactly how I edit an image into a more vintage style portrait, but in a photographic way.  </p>  <p>  \t      Finally in Sections 3 and 4, we dive into Photoshop&#039;s painting capabilities, where I show you my techniques for creating illustrative Pin-up paintings in a digitally modern way. <br>  \t<br>  \t      Included in this course are 2 gorgeous Pin-up Girl images for you to work along side of me, two texture overlays, and my own personal Pin-up brush set for Photoshop (sold normally for $20 on my website). <br>  \t<br>  \t      By the end of this course, you will be familiar with some of the painting tools and techniques available to you within Photoshop. You will also have a good understand how to move a photograph away from it&#039;s modern day photographic space and render a more vintage style image or painting that is sure to impress your portrait clients.  </p>",
