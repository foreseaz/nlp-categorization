It covers the most needed basic and intermediate Git concepts that form the foundation of this wonderful source control management system (SCM) so that the student can go up and running within a matter of few hours. However, this is not say that this Git course covers things in hurry. On the contrary, all the foundation Git concepts are explained with utmost care so that the student feels (assuming a newbie or starter) comfortable with the concepts that has been laid down with great consideration and due diligence.

Once the prerequisites are taken care of, the subsequent lectures carefully crafts it way through explaining step-by-step process of Git repository creation process. The Git repository creation process comes in three flavors - creating from scratch with nothing on hand, converting an unversioned code base to Git repository and Cloning a Git repository that was existing on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The section \"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Enter GitHub</strong>\" explains this massively popular web based Git repository with utmost care and precision.
