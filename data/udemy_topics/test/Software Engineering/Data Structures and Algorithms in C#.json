    "description": "<p><strong>This is a thoroughly detailed course that uses lots of animations to help you visualize the concepts.</strong></p><p>This course will help you develop a strong background in Data Structures and Algorithms. The course is broken down into easy to assimilate short lectures, and after each topic there is a quiz that can help you to test your newly acquired knowledge. The examples are explained with animations to simplify the learning of this complex topic. <strong>Complete working programs</strong> are shown for each concept that is explained.</p><p>This course provides a comprehensive explanation of data structures like linked lists, stacks and queues, binary search trees, heap. Various sorting algorithms with implementation and analysis are included. Concept of recursion is very important for designing and understanding certain algorithms so the process of recursion is explained with the help of several examples.</p><p>Throughout the course, a step by step approach is followed to make you understand different Data Structures and Algorithms. Through this course you can build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms that can help you to <strong>crack coding interviews</strong> and work in the industry.</p><p>In this course, C# is used for implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms, but you can easily implement them in any other language like C++, Java or Python.</p>",
