    "description": "<p>This course helps you to learn socket programming and become a better professional programmer.</p><p>Each video lecture is focused on one important aspect about socket programming &amp; network communication. Concise code examples are supplied, and a demo after every couple of lectures will show you practical implementation of the concepts described earlier.  </p>  <p>  \t        By the end of this course, you will be able to create C# .Net software capable of sending and receiving data over TCP/IP sockets on peer to peer basis in an asynchronous fashion. The course will make you a better programmer</p><strong></strong><p>  \t<strong>Why take this course?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                        You should take this course if you're a professional(or student) with some coding experience in the past but lack understanding of how computer networks work on a software level.  </p>  <p>  \t                  You will learn techniques which are useful in real life scenarios commonly faced by programmers.  </p>  <p>  \t                      Section 1 contains very useful information anybody can benefit from, whether they're familiar with C#.Net or not.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Minimum upfront theory</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                        A lot of courses tend to pile up theory ahead of the real code, this course is going take a minimum theory first approach.  </p>  <p>  \t                                      You will learn essentials of network programming and start writing code in under 15 minutes.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Use of Windows Forms</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                        From start to the end this course will use Windows Forms, an approach different from many others taking the command line route. This teaching methodology makes the course lot less boring and non-classroom like, practically useful and really suitable for professionals.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Short, sweet, to the point</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                Yes sir, entire course is designed with the busy professionals in mind and the videos were created to make your online learning experience fruitful and easy.  </p><p><strong>Asynchronous Sockets, modern real world solution</strong></p><p>In traditional socket programming scenarios, (multi) threading is use to create a responsive server or client. I have bypassed that route and shown you how to use asynchronous sockets directly.</p>  <p>  \t<strong>Reinforced learning</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                Each section contains a quiz on the end which is very helpful to ensure that you review and retain important bits of information imparted in relevant course section.</p>  <p>  \t<strong>Open Source Project</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tAll source code shown in this course is also made available as a Git repository through GitHub. The Visual Studio 2010 C# solution is out there! Students can create their own branches, and push changes back for community benefit.  </p><p><strong>Join an active community</strong></p><p>Become a part of the 4000 + programmers who have already taken this course. Your questions will be answered by the fellow students and the course instructor as well. Really a wonderful place to start learning!</p>  <p>  \t<strong>Learn something new</strong></p><p>Sockets are considered an advanced topic, a danger zone in programming parlance. Knowing it means you take your trade seriously.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Bonus</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  You will also learn how to implement various sanity checks using tryparse and try/catch.  </p>",
