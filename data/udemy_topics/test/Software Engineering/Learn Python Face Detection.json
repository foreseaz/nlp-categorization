    "description": "<p>This course covers the fundamentals of Python programming, as well as an introduction to using image-processing techniques to identify a human face in live video recordings. It will be taught by myself through my desktop, and I will be coding from scratch, and step by step to insure that no ambiguity is present.</p><p>This course will start out with a brief overview of Python basics such as variables, for and while loops, boolean statements, functions and more. After becoming familiar with Python, we will dive into some image-processing concepts and start on our Python script to detect human faces!</p><p>This course is intended for anyone who wants to quickly pick up Python and start working on an interesting, applicable project instead of drudging along a twenty-hour tutorial. My videos are short, hands-on, interactive and engaging, so you&#039;ll come out happy and enthusiastic with a large amount of gained knowledge.</p>",
