I also use concept mapping on an everyday basis as a means of <strong>communicating more clear</strong>, <strong>acquiring knowledge faster</strong>, <strong>developing and designing better systems</strong> and <strong>catalyst creative thinking</strong>.</p><p>A special note for software developers and software analysts, talking the course; The concept mapping (also called <strong>domain modelling</strong> or <strong>conceptual modelling</strong>) thought in this course gives you a very thorough understanding on the foundations of <strong>object-oriented class modelling</strong>. I have for more than 17 years professionally developed object-oriented systems and for more than 5 years I worked in a small company together with some of the founding \"fathers\" (including Ivar Jacobson) <span>of UML and Object Oriented Design (OOD), where we developed tools for Software Architects and Analysts.    </span>   </p><p>Concept mapping <strong>will propel your success rate in delivering value</strong> and getting rid of the most crucial waste; <strong>the waste of doing the wrong things, in the wrong order for the wrong reason</strong>.<br></p>  <hr>  <blockquote>  \t<em>“I want to underline the excellent quality of the course and can only encourage people to take it.
