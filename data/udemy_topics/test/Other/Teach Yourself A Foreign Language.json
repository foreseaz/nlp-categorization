    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t <em style=\"\">    Teach Yourself A Foreign Language</em> will guide any aspiring language student through the process of becoming proficient in their target language. No matter what language you are learning, or what level you are at, you will learn useful strategies that will save you time, money and effort.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     With the advent of new technologies, and the numerous products that use them, it can be a daunting task to decide where to begin, and what to invest in. How do you even know which of these products are worthwhile? This course can help you make the right choice based on understanding your own particular learning style and needs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     The course is presented as a series of videos that demonstrate useful strategies that will benefit you during different stages of language learning. From beginning to end, the course is over 3.5 hours of video content. However, you will want to return to certain sections of the course as you progress with your language learning. How long it takes to complete the course, really depends on how long it takes you to learn a language, as the course will be here to guide you through the steps of learning a language AS you learn the language. However, I do recommend viewing the course straight through so you can get an idea of the overall process of learning a language.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     This course is right for you if:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">you have been wanting to learn a language, but you weren&#039;t sure how to begin</li>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">you have started learning a language but you need inspiration and motivation to continue</li>  \t<li style=\"\">you have trouble understanding native speakers of your target language</li>  \t<li style=\"\">you are looking for ways to learn a language more quickly and efficiently</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Obviously, this course will not actually teach you a language. Rather it guides you through the process of language acquisition on your own. This process usually requires an investment in software programs and / or books. The course will help you decide which of these resources is best for you at any given time during the process of language learning. You will ultimately save money with your personal language learning investment over time, and attain your language learning goals much more quickly and efficiently.  </p>",
