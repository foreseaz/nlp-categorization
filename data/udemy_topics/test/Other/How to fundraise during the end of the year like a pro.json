    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      My first year fundraising I was petrified. The pressure was on to deliver and I had never done anything like fundraising before. One night I saw an email had a statistic that changed everything for me. The statistic was simple - 24% of all donations for the year happen in December, and most of those occur in the last week of the year.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      I read this two weeks before the end of the year - I had to act fast. That week I put together a communications campaign that raised over $10,000 during that last week. I tried the campaign again, and raised $30,000 in one day!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This year, consumers will donate an estimated $48 billion dollars between November and December this year. You have the same opportunity right now to raise some serious cash.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This class will teach you, step-by-step, how to develop a strategic plan to reaching and motivating donors so that they donate. I will also include the exact campaign I used to raise that $30,000.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Did you know that non-profits who develop a strategic plan and refine it every year can experience up to 70 percent growth in year-end giving? Let&#039;s make sure your cause gets the funding you need.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Now, here are some things to consider:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">If all this course did was teach you how to organize your communications tools so that they work together, would it be worth the investment? YES!</li>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">If all this course did was teach you how to talk to your donors so that they respond and want to donate, would it be worth the investment? YES!</li>  </ul>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">If all this course did was double your investment, would it be worth it? YES!</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t      In fact, I&#039;m so confident that you&#039;ll make at least double your investment that if you don&#039;t raise $600 in the next three months as a result of the things you learn in this course, I&#039;ll refund your money - no questions asked.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t*UPDATE - For Udemy subscribers we&#039;re offering this course for FREE. Raising money during the end of the year is so important for non-profits that we want EVERYONE to kill it this year.*  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This is the time of year to get your donors motivated, so what are you waiting for?! Let&#039;s get started.  </p>",
