I learned more about flying my phantom in a few minutes- just in these first lessons about heading and gimbal pitch- then I have since flying and searching online the past 9 months. Just the investment of time it would have taken to find this information on my own is by far much greater and, in monetary comparison, WELL worthy every penny I paid for the course! Excellent work\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Michel Rivet</strong></em><br></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"This filmschool course 2 is a great add-on to the filmschool 1 both are amazing.
