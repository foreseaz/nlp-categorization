    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  When I was working my full time job, I always thought to myself “I wish I could find a way to work at home and make money to help pay the bills.” I could not stand dropping my kids off at Daycare and being away from them for 10-12 hours per day.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I would buy into many of the “Work-at-Home” scams out there. (Yes, curiosity killed the cat!) And you know what happened? I was really getting sick of wasting so much time, money and effort trying to find a legit business that I could make money with.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Does this sound familiar? If so, please keep reading to find out what I discovered.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I created this course because I want to show YOU how to avoid the mistakes I made.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I also want help you save a lot of money and time by giving you the actual names and contact information about the companies that are SCAMS and the companies that are legit!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I will tell you which actual companies and programs I tried and what their sales pitch is. I will tell you their actual contact information and what the scam is with their program.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I will also tell you about tons of other work-at-home SCAMS that I haven’t personally tried, but know they are SCAMS because of what others have told me about them.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I will tell you all this information so that you don’t pay a dime to these scam artists and they will stop making money off desperate souls like you and I!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Are you ready to listen and learn? Then start watching the videos in this course, read the supplementary material I offer and pass the link of this course on to all your friends (email, FB, twitter - any way you can!). My goal is to have 3,000 students (minimum) take this course! Will you help me reach that goal by taking it yourself? I hope so! :)  </p>",
