    "description": "<p>  \tLook around you. Most of what you see was designed by someone. Now think about the soundscapes you have experienced today. The odds are, most of them have been accidental and unpleasant. Sound profoundly affects every area of our lives, from our health to our productivity.<br>  \t<br>  \t  The word &#039;soundscape&#039; was coined by the Canadian composer and author Murray Schafer. Schafer used the word to describe all of the sound around us. &#039;Soundscaping&#039;, the verb, describes the process of consciously designing that sound; taking responsibility for it and creating sound that is appropriate, effective and intentional. This skill can be applied anywhere; in your home, in your office, in your schools.<br>  \t<br>  \t  My mission is to make the world sound beautiful. I&#039;ve spoken about this topic on the TED stage in my talk <em>Why architects need to use their ears</em>. As founder of The Sound Agency, my company works with some of the world&#039;s biggest brands to increase their sales and customer satisfaction by improving the way they sound. Now I share this knowledge with you to help you master the art of soundscaping.  </p>",
