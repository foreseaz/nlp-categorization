    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t                               Have you heard the term &quot;the Cloud&quot; or  the phrase &quot;Store it in the cloud&quot;. Of course you have whether it was on a television commercial or something you viewed on the internet. If you haven&#039;t, don&#039;t worry about it, I will explain it all to you throughout this course. The &quot;cloud&quot; has become a very popular application that you should get familiar with. You never know when you may need it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                         You will learn about the various types of cloud storage. I go over three of them in this course. I will discuss with you how to download one of these cloud storage apps on your computer and set it up. There are three small project assignments that I have included that will also help you learn to do this as well. I will touch on the cost of cloud storage and what we use cloud storage apps for. I will also briefly discuss the security of cloud storage as well as the advantages and disadvantages.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                         I have also included a few quizzes to help you and I both see how much you have learned from this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                       Throughout this course I will be using a Mac, but you can use a Mac or a PC.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Over the next few months I will be adding more material and projects to this course. A few things to look forward to are a few lectures about CrashPlan and BigStash (beta). If you have any suggestions of anything more that I could add, please feel free to let me know.  </p>",
