And, </em><em style=\"\">I will take you step by step through a variety of options for preparing and protecting a mobile device by selecting appropriate accessories for a user with special needs. I will address a range of considerations for people of all ages with special needs, such as how to choose a protective case, which stylus might be beneficial, is a separate keyboard necessary and what is a Bubcap? This course will ensure that you have access to information to assist you in setting up a device for success.</em></p>",
