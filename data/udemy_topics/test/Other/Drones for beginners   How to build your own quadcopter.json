The concepts can be applied to any class of Quadcopters, even other multi-copters such as Hexacopters.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tHow long the course takes is entirely up to the student, it can be finished in a day or a week, depending on how much time is allocated to it.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tCourse is structured in a way that it fully explains the theory and demonstrates the build in a very easy to understand manner.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tYou should take this course if you want to fast track your understanding instead of tirelessly reading countless forums to get a basic understanding of the hobby.  </p>",
