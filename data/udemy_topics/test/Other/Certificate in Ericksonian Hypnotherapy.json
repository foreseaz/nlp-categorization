    "description": "<p>  \t   This course is about Ericksonian Hypnotherapy. It teaches you about the history of hypnosis, through to the work of Milton H Erickson and how to do Ericksonian Hypnotherapy. By the end you will know how to do hypnotherapy without the need for structured hypnotic inductions, without the need for hypnotherapy scripts, and without the need to just do 'suggestion therapy' hypnotherapy. You will know how to work with clients as unique, individual human being, and tailor what you do to each person as an individual.</p><p>Once you complete the course and have received your Udemy certificate you can send me a message and I will send you a PDF Sussex Hypnotherapy Centre certificate of completion which says how many hours CPD you have done. This is helpful if you need evidence of undertaking a certain number of hours continued professional development as a practitioner.</p>  <p>  \t   The course is made up of video lectures with PDF's of the slides used within the lectures, and additional information to help with learning, as well as a video demonstration filmed at a live training event of Ericksonian Language Patterns being used, and some Ericksonian Hypnotherapy demonstration Mp3's which can be analysed for learning purposes, and used for self-hypnosis, or self-help. There is also a quiz at the end of most sections to help with your learning.  </p>  <p>  \t   The course should take about 12 hours minimum to complete, but to get the most out of this training it is recommended that you take time to absorb and learn from each lesson by going and practising with friends, family and like-minded people, as well as going and observing people and reading some of the books from the recommended reading list to broaden your knowledge. Curiosity is the key to developing mastery and success. It is also good to ask questions and interact with others in the discussion areas of the lectures to get others understandings and views and experiences on different elements of the training.  </p>  <p>  \t   The course is structured to give you an overview of the history of hypnosis before focusing in on the work of Milton H Erickson. The course then takes you through the underpinning foundations of Ericksonian Hypnotherapy before building on this with Ericksonian Hypnotic Language Patterns and structuring hypnotherapy sessions.  </p>  <p>  \t   This course is ideal for those that are new to hypnosis and keen to learn about how to do hypnosis, for those with experience with hypnosis who perhaps use hypnosis scripts or structured inductions and just suggesting problems away, that want to develop their skill and knowledge at being able to do hypnotherapy with people without the need for structured inductions and just the use of suggestion therapy. It is also ideal for hypnotherapist that perhaps don't have much knowledge or experience with Ericksonian Hypnotherapy and want to take a course for continued professional development (CPD), or Life-Coaches, NLP Practitioners, Coaches, Counsellors and other therapists that want to learn about Ericksonian Hypnotherapy to add this skill to the therapy or coaching you already offer.  </p><p>(Different places in the world have different rules around who can practice as a hypnotherapist. My view is to practice as a hypnotherapist you should undertake extensive live classroom tuition which teaches therapy and then only work with those client groups you have been trained to work with. If you are totally untrained but have an interest in learning Ericksonian hypnotherapy this course will teach you all you need to know, but I would recommend you shouldn't work as a hypnotherapist based just on taking this course. This course will still teach you advanced communication skills which can be helpful in a wide range of life situations. If you have trained in hypnotherapy, counselling, coaching, or NLP or other similar fields then Ericksonian hypnotherapy should make great additional skills for your tool-box to use with clients you have been trained to work with, and this course should also give you a greater understanding about your use of language and other skills with clients even if you aren't doing hypnosis)<br></p>  <p>  \tDan Jones, the course tutor, is one of the UK's leading Ericksonian Hypnotherapists with over 20 years experience.
