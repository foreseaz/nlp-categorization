The course uses a concrete business scenario to present a simple, easy-to-learn approach for creating these diagrams from an interview with a Subject Matter Expert (SME). You will learn how to create a Rigorous Physical Process Model, evolve it to a Context-Level Data Flow Diagram, and explode the context-level process(es) and data to reveal the nitty-gritty detail (individual process specifications and detailed data specifications) that developers need.</p><p><em style=\"\">The course answers the following questions:</em></p><ul style=\"\"><li>What is a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)?</li><li>What is a Rigorous Physical Process Model?</li><li>What is a Context-Level DFD?</li><li>Why should I use Data Flow Diagrams?</li><li>What symbols can I use on each type of diagram?</li><li>How can I drill down into a process?</li><li>How can I show internal processes and flows that produce the results?</li><li>What does balancing a Data Flow Diagram mean and what is the business value?</li><li>What is the most efficient approach to balancing a DFD?</li><li>What business value do process specifications offer?</li><li>How can I express detailed specifications for processes and data?</li><li>What is “metadata&quot; and why do you need it?</li><li>What does a fully balanced DFD look like?</li><li>What value does a DFD fragment provide?</li></ul><p>Regardless of your job title or role, if you are tasked with communicating a workflow or functional requirements to others, this course will help. It is interactive (includes exercises with instant feedback), instructionally designed (based on modern learning theory), and &quot;intellimated™&quot; (uses animated visuals with an accompanying audio track) to hold your interest and increase retention.</p>",
