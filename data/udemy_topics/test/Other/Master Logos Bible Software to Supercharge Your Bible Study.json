Once students go through this course, they will feel very comfortable in Logos, and will know where and how to find the information they are looking for.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              Many pastors, scholars, and those interested in studying the Bible are busy, and don't always have a library nearby. Logos has made the Bible easier to study than ever. Logos will quite literally become your research assistant for all topics related to ehte Bible.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Finally, after owning Logos for many years, I feel in control of the program and that I understand all that it can do for me. The lectures are easy to follow and go through every Logos menu item. Brilliant!</em> — Graham Bennett</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Content and Overview</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t              Currently covering all aspects of Logos version 5, new version 6 users should note that v5 and v6 are VERY similar.
