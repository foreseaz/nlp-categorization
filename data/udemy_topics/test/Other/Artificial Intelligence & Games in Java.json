    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is about the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence. This topic is getting very hot nowadays because these learning algorithms can be used in several fields from software engineering to investment banking. Learning algorithms can recognize patterns which can help detect cancer for example. We may construct algorithms that can have a very  very good guess about stocks movement in the market. </p><p style=\"\">In the first chapter we are going to talk about the basic graph algorithms. Several advanced algorithms can be solved with the help of graphs, so as far as I am concerned these algorithms are the first steps.</p><p style=\"\">Second chapter is about local search: finding minimum and maximum or global optimum in the main. These searches are used frequently when we use regression for example and want to find the parameters for the fit.</p><p style=\"\">The last topic will be about minimax algorithm and how to use these technique in games such as chess or tic tac toe. </p><p style=\"\"></p>",
