    "description": "<p>Hi!</p><p>This course is about software architecture and design patterns. We will talk about two man topics: SOLID principles and design patterns. We are going to implement the problems in Java, but the theoretical background is language-independent. I highly recommend typing out the implementations several times on your own in order to get a good grasp of it.</p><p>In the first part of the course we are going to learn about the SOLID principles. We are going to talk about the theory as well as the implementations.</p><p>The second part of the course is about design patterns. We should have a deep understanding of these patterns in order to be able to write reusable software components. These techniques are becoming more and more important as applications are getting more and more complex, so - in my opinion - these topics are good to know.</p><p></p><p></p>",
