    "description": "<p>This course aimed at students<strong> with beginner to intermediate skill in F#</strong>, basic understanding of the F# syntax and a light functional understanding would be beneficial. You'll also need a computer with Linux, OSX or Windows with F# installed and an internet connection.</p><p>Have you wanted to understand how to 'do' <strong>machine learning</strong> or implement algorithms from a textbook in a programming language, or <strong>deploy a library to Nuget</strong>? Well, this course includes sections on <strong>machine learning </strong>using a mathematical theorem known as<strong> Bayes' Theorem</strong>. </p><p><strong>What will we do?<br></strong>We will complete two F# project together, </p><ol><li>We will start by creating a <strong>predictive text</strong> engine and <strong>deploy it to Nuget</strong>, while learning how to write some basic<strong> unit tests in FsUnit</strong><strong>.</strong> We will explore every line of code together and point out all the important programming concept as we progress.</li><li>Then we will use <strong>Bayes' Theorem</strong> to classify spam messages using real world data. We'll build a command line application and <strong>parse command line arguments</strong><span> so that we can use our program on the command line.</span></li></ol><p><strong>What is f#?</strong><br>F# is a mature, functional-first language especially well suited to computer science, <strong>machine learning</strong>, distributed computing and web applications too. There really is no limit to what F# can do for you!</p><p>We’ve structured the course to make learning all the material as easy and accessible as possible. We’ll challenge you to complete an F# programming task in every video to make sure you’ve got a great grip on all the concepts. But don’t worry, because after every challenge, we’ll also walk you through a solution line by line.</p><p>We have structured the course to introduce you to some<strong> computer science concepts</strong>, but to also encourage you to spend your own time to gain further insights into the concepts we introduce you to.</p><p>If you want to program with a language that has computer science at its heart and want to future proof your learning then this course is for you.</p>",
