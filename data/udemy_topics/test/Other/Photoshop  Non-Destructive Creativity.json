    "description": "<p>In this course you will learn key Photoshop techniques that allow you to work non-destructively. Why? So you can let your creative juices flow, knowing you have multiple ways of changing your mind, repurposing your work – and so you can “reverse engineer” projects you did months ago and can’t remember how you got the result. You'll learn how to work faster, to be more accurate and to open up a whole new world of flexibility and creativity. Working nondestructively means a whole lot more than being able to change your mind: you'll also find that you will be able to work with more accuracy, and get more work done in less time.</p><p>This course is not a beginner's guide to Photoshop: it assumes a good understanding of key Photoshop functions such as layers, and the lessons are aimed at experienced users who want to take their knowledge up a notch. There are 14 lessons covering these topic areas:</p><p>Adjustment Layers, Layers and Masks, The Bend If Sliders, Grouping Layers and Clipping Masks,and Smart Objects and Smart Filters.</p><p>Also included are 4 Bonus Lessons that explore other functions that can speed up work work and give your creativity a boost such as using and creating your own keyboard shortcuts and making brushes.</p><p>A Photoshop Instructor since version 1.0, Dave Cross brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in sharing techniques that are practical and understandable. In 2009 Dave was inducted into the Photoshop Hall of Fame to recognize his work as a Photoshop Educator - and you get to benefit from his teaching experience.</p><p>By the end of the course you will have a much better understanding of the non-destructive workflow, how to structure your Photoshop documents for success, and the creative possibilities you can explore using the techniques that are taught in this class.</p>",
