    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course takes the painfully dry regulations and methods used for clinical trials on medical devices and distills them nicely into a clean overview over the course of an hour.  Students will learn about Good Clinical Practices (GCP&#039;s) and the regulations that govern clinical trials in the USA and rest of world, such as 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 812 and the ICH guidelines.  As a &quot;quick hit&quot; to gain knowledge, this course works wonderfully for getting new trainees to hit the ground running.  It also serves to increase the knowledge of current Clinical Research Associates, especially those who are soon looking to take a certification exam for clinical research.</p>",
