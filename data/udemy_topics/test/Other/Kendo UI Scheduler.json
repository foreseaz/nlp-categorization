    "description": "<p>  \tThis course introduces developers to one of the latest Kendo UI Web widgets: the scheduler. Now, developers can build better web sites powered by the ability to create events (tasks/appointments) through a simple web widget. The ability to preview tasks in day, week, month, and calendar view is supported.  </p>  <p>  \tThe author will follow a hands-on approach where all the features and options are shown through examples. The only tools needed are Notepad++ and a web browser (such as Google Chrome).  </p>  <p>  \tThe course will start by introducing the scheduler and comparing the functionality to a similar scheduler (like Office Outlook). Then the scheduler features and options are discussed step-by-step using carefully selected examples.  </p>  <p>  \tBy the time the user is done with this course, he/she will be well equipped to power his/her site with the new scheduler functionality.  </p>  <p>  \tPlease note that since the scheduler is currently in beta release, some of the functionality might change, but the core concepts will remain the same.  </p>",
