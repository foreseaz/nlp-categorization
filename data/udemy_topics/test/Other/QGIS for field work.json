QGIS is a free and open source Geographic information system.</p><p>I will cover the following</p><p>The first part of this course will cover some useful features for field use, and examples of use</p><p>The second part will take on how to configure QGIS to be easier to use in the field. QGIS can be used in the field as is, but QGIS has so many features that can make it much better.</p><p>Part three is all about how to get started with creating a Shapefile and a form. A Shapefile is a spatial data file that we will use to capture spatial data. I will also create a form, and show you how to build a form to avoid errors and make it quicker to populate data</p><p>Part four will take on how to create a QGIS project. A QGIS project is a file where you can save all your settings. This will make it much easier to start off where you last stopped your work, without setting up everything again.</p><p>In part five, I will teach you how to capture and update date using the Shapefile and form created in part three</p><p>Part six is the final part of this course. I will here cover areas related to how to store your data, and the importance of backups</p><p>Course Curriculum</p><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Examples of use</li><li>Configure QGIS for field use</li><li>Create a Shapefile </li><li>Create a form</li><li>Capture data</li><li>Update data </li><li>Manage data<span></span></li></ul><p><span></span></p>",
