You <br>have to build it into your daily work and start thinking the way Excel <br>\"thinks\". </p><p>I would like to give you a case study, where starting from the beginning we are building a dashboard together while explaining all the necessary steps to do so. My goal is to show you how to create an interactive, automated, easy to use data structure for reporting purposes by using basic and advanced functions, moreover, designing and advanced controlling elements.   <br></p><p>With this course I will focus on a real-life example I had<br> to face during my work and try to shed light on what Excel is capable <br>of. The structure of the course touches the  basics as well, so that if<br> you do not have a strong basis, it still gives you guidance and a firm <br>fund to continues and handle more complex data structures and dashboards. My aim is to show you how the functions work and then give you some tips how to use them in creating data structures. <br>Although this case study covers one specific problem and its solution, I would encourage you to use all the skills you can learn from it, as dozens of similar structures can be created on the basis of the curriculum you find in this course.<br></p><p>In case you have any question, please let me know, I will gladly help you.<br></p><p>I wish you all the best for the course!<br><br></p>",
