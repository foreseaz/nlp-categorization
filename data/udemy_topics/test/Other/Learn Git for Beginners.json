    "description": "<p>So here&#039;s the deal. Being a marketer and &quot;learning how to code&quot; is all the rage these days. But what does that actually mean? </p><p>If you&#039;re a marketer who works with developers to get things done, it&#039;s time you learned how version control (Git/Github) works. By learning the fundamentals, it will make you more self-sufficient and accomplish more in less time. This course guides you through the the basics, and how to get up and running quickly.</p><p>This course is designed for marketers who are interested in understanding how version control works, but don&#039;t know where to start. </p><p><strong style=\"\">For Marketers</strong></p><p>This course teaches you everything you need to know, and avoids the stuff that you won&#039;t use. This course is taught by a marketer who understands what marketers should use on a daily basis. </p><p><strong style=\"\">Highly Relevant</strong></p><p>In this course you won&#039;t learn pointless commands, but instead, tutorials will be geared towards real-life examples. This will enable you to use your learnings tomorrowâ€¦instead of never.</p><p>This class won&#039;t teach you how to automatically favorite posts on Twitter (or whatever the latest growth hack is), but instead teaches you a very important skill that will make you extremely valuable and give you a competitive advantage over your peers. Using version control is a normal part of working at a technology company, don&#039;t you think it&#039;s time you learned what pulling, pushing, merging is and how to do it?</p><p>Don&#039;t believe me? Ask an engineer what&#039;s more important. Auto-favoriting Twitter posts, or learning version control? Here&#039;s what developers are saying already:</p><p><em style=\"\">&quot;Version control is a rare tool that I would say is absolutely required, even if you are only using it as a solo developer. Some people say that it&#039;s a tool that you live and die by, I agree with that assertion.&quot;</em></p><p><em style=\"\">&quot;Version control is almost impossible to live without after you start using it. It is indispensable if more than one developers are working on the same code base...but it also quite useful for a single developer.&quot;</em></p><p>If this is so important to developers, and you need to work with developers to get things done, don&#039;t you think it&#039;s time you learned how this works?</p><p>Maybe you&#039;ve tried learning in the past - you&#039;ve spent hours Google searching how to get started, and still have trouble understanding what everything means. That&#039;s totally okay! The reason why this happens is because 95% of the articles written about version control are written to developers, not marketers. This course is tailored to you, a marketer.</p><p>These other articles assume that you know things, that you probably don&#039;t know. Let me guide you through this maze, and show you how awesome version control is, and how you can use it daily as a marketer.</p><p>This course is a culmination of my learnings over the past 3 years. Let me help you not make the same mistakes I&#039;ve made. You&#039;ll also save a ton of time in the process.</p><p></p><p><strong style=\"\">What people are saying about this course:</strong></p><p>&quot;To work effectively with developers, learning Git is essential.
