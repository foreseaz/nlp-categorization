You will learn how to select equipment, prepare your client and apply hot stone for a deeply relaxing and therapeutic massage. We will cover the history of hot stone and what makes basal stones special.  I will help you to increase your revenue through correct cost structuring and increased client satisfaction which always translate in to repeat business and referrals. After going through the benefits and effects of hot stone we will go through the sequence for full body with video and auditory comments.  The sequence is also available for you to download.  The course will also take you through how to care for your client from consultation to hygiene and aftercare advice.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Course requirement  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Course requirements include massage table, towels, hot stones &amp; heater and massage oil.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     No previous knowledge is required, this is an introductory course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     The content of this course includes Video Demonstrations and lessons , Sequence &amp; theory notes are prepared as downloads, Quiz questions are included to test your knowledge and email feedback and comments are readily on hand for your learning experience.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     The course is divided into 20 minutes lessons, with a ten minute quiz at the end.  There are 6 lessons; an introduction and conclusion. The biggest time commitment is going to be practise of the massage to learn the sequence; I recommend a minimum of 10 massages performed on 2 clients who will give you loads of feedback on your pressure and rhythm.
