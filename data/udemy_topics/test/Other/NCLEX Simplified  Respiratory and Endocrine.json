    "description": "<p>NCLEX Simplified is a method that teaches in informational chunks that better prepare the test taker by instilling confidence over raw question strategy that is based on things like... the Decision Tree (ugh). </p><p>This course covers the Endocrine and Respiratory sections in full detail. Learn about ABGs and SIADH, Diabetes and orthopnea. The list goes on and on, but the info is actually short and sweet. In fact, that&#039;s the point of NCLEX Simplified. It&#039;s all the information you need and none of the stuff you don&#039;t!</p><p>This course is best paired with the other NCLEX Simplified lectures on this web site. By watching all of them (repeatedly if necessary) to absorb the information, you will go into your NCLEX well-prepared. For even more preparation, contact the author of this course, Lisa Chou, and ask what tutoring options are available.</p><p>Good luck and study hard!</p>",
