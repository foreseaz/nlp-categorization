    "description": "<p>This course focuses on moving <strong>SQL Server Databases</strong> to Amazon's <strong>RDS SERVICE</strong>. Amazon's cloud is called <strong>AWS</strong> which stands for <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong><strong> </strong>and their database offering is called <strong>RDS</strong> or <strong>Relational Database Service</strong>.</p><p>Before <strong>WE </strong>get started I would like to share <strong>MY</strong> excitement on <strong>co-authoring</strong> my first course. I will be working with noted cloud expert <strong>Ryan Kroonenburg</strong>. This is the first course I'm co-authoring and couldn't be more excited about working with author and AWS Could Architect Ryan Kroonenburg. Ryan's been teaching AWS centric courses on Udemy for quite some time and his courses are the most highly rated AWS courses available. </p><p><strong>HOW </strong>is this course different from my course titled <em>How To</em> <em>Become a SQL Server Cloud Architect on AWS</em>? This course is more focused on <strong>MIGRATING</strong> your on premise databases to RDS. We will be solely focused on RDS and walk through several migration and post migration <strong>STRATEGIES</strong>. </p><p>This course is <strong>NOT</strong> for any of the current AWS certifications. Currently, there are <strong>NO</strong> database specific <strong>certifications</strong> for Amazon's RDS platform.</p><p>This course <strong>WILL</strong> give you the skills necessary to move SQL Server Database to Amazon's cloud. The course will provide <strong>YOU</strong> with <strong>REAL WORLD</strong> examples on how to <strong>MOVE</strong> your existing database to the cloud.</p><p>Amazon's control <strong>58%</strong> of the cloud market and is spending approximately a <strong>BILLION</strong> a year on cementing that lead over it's closest competition, which is Microsoft Azure. Currently, Azure comes in second at 12%.</p><p>As a SQL Server Consultant I can tell you that many of my customers are <strong>MOVING</strong> to Amazon's various cloud offerings.</p><p>There are still many <strong>LIMITATIONS</strong> and nuances to moving SQL Server Databases to the cloud. We will discuss many of these in the course.</p><p>The code, applications, and TOOLS (like Management Studio) you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS <strong>AUTOMATICALLY</strong> patches the database software and backs up your database, storing the backups for a user-defined retention period and enabling point-in-time recovery.</p><p>Amazon <strong>RDS</strong> makes it easy to use replication to enhance availability and reliability for production workloads. Using the Multi-AZ deployment option you can run <strong>MISSION CRITICAL</strong> workloads with high availability and built-in automated fail-over from your primary database to a synchronously replicated secondary database in case of a failure.</p><p>Availability zone replication is very much like having a built in SQL Server Cluster with the click of a button. This course will set up SQL Server Availability Zones for our<strong> </strong><strong>HIGH AVAILABILITY</strong><strong> </strong>needs.</p><p><strong>ENROLL NOW!!. Let's Get Started</strong></p>",
