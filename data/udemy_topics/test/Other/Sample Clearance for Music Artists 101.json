Many music artists sample other's music but it’s illegal and a serious issue to ignore to get permission from the original owner of the songs. </p><p><strong>If you sample without asking permission, you could face serious legal trouble, lawsuits, and even money damages. </strong></p>\n\n<p>The process of getting permission from the owners of the sampled music is referred to as sample clearance. </p><p><strong>Sample clearance is a process that all music artists should do and it will save you from serious legal action you could face if you sample without permission.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>If you’re a music artist or producer, odds are you either have or will be faced with the issue of using a sample in your music.</strong> </p><p>The biggest problem is that most people wait too long before they start dealing with the legal aspects associated with clearing those samples.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you plan to use samples in your music, you need to get permission to avoid serious legal trouble. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In this course, you will learn the step-by-step process of asking permission to sample a song and also learn about music copyright law and how to avoid other serious issues you could face as a music artist.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>★<strong> Student review</strong> by Jennifer D, <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">“Clear and concise - Great, useful information presented in a concise manner. I was really able to apply this easily to my current work.”</em></p>\n\n<p>★ <strong>Student review</strong> by Aryan Rabizadeh, <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">\"This course is very interesting and I would highly recommend it to everyone in the music industry who sample music. I've been a DJ in the music industry for over 6 years and I've always been confused about how to legally sample music .

Would watch again and refer my friends in the music industry!\"</em><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>► WHY DO I NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>To sample or not to sample? </strong></p><p>This is the question many times a producer, DJ, and songwriter must struggle with on a daily basis. </p><p>Sampling is fun, and in the era of the today’s strictly digital production world, very easy to do. </p>\n\n<p>Typically, most independent releases remain under the radar and never draw enough attention to face the <strong>serious legal ramifications of not clearing samples</strong>. </p><p>However, not clearing samples is still a serious dangerous place to be. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Using someone else’s recording in your music without permission can lead to serious consequences including, lawsuits or the inability to distribute your music to the public.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You could have an unexpected hit from that release and find yourself in a very defenseless position. </p><p>The owner of one uncleared sample could have that record pulled from your project or ask for an unreasonable amount of payment because they are aware that you’re in a vulnerable spot.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re lost whether or not you can sample from an existing song and how much is permissible to use, and whether you need permission to use a sample in your new sound recording, <strong>this course will clarify all of this for you along with the the do's and don’ts of sampling.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Golden Rule of Music Law: <strong>if you don't own or control it, you likely need a license to use it. </strong></p><p>If you produce or remix music for other artists, it’s usually your responsibility to clear any samples introduced during the recording process. The artist or their label will probably make you contractually responsible for doing so as a pre-condition to the final record. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In this course, you will learn how to go about sampling, how to avoid getting sued, and learn the step-by-step process of asking permission to sample a song.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>★ COURSE BONUSES ★</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>What to Do if You Can’t Get Sample Clearance?<br></strong></li><li><strong>What You Can Get When Someone Samples Your Song?<br></strong></li><li><strong>What You Need If Your Song is Part of an Advertisement or Endorsement?<br></strong></li><li><strong>Can You Use Sample Packs as Samples?<br></strong></li><li><strong>The In’s and Out’s of Music Copyright Law<br></strong></li><li><strong>Actionable and Useful Resources &amp; Other Tools to Help You Grow as a Music Artist</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>What makes this course unique is that it’s an<strong> over-comprehensive course</strong> of everything you need to get sample clearance on your own.<br></p>\n\n<p>With over <strong>two-hours of HD video content</strong>, you will be able to learn the secrets that many successful music artists use to create samples in their music.</p>\n\n<p><br></p><p><em>Thank you for making this the best selling sample clearance course on Udemy!
