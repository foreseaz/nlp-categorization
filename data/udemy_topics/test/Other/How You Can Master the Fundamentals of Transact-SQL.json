    "description": "<p><strong>SQL Server</strong> is a combination of two core items The first is the <strong>administration</strong> side of the house. Creating databases, managing logins and users, backups,… etc.</p><p>The second part of the equation is that of <strong>developing</strong> code in a language called <strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>uery <strong>L</strong>anguage. </p><p>Microsoft’s flavor of SQL is called <strong>Transact-SQL</strong>. </p><p>Transact was <strong>designed</strong> primarily to work with <strong>relational databases</strong>. Transact is the language used to talk to SQL Server. </p><p>When we want to <strong>create a database</strong> a database we use DDL or <strong>Data Definition Language.</strong> I’m defining an object when I use the statement with the code. </p><p>When we want to <strong>see data inside a table</strong> we use DML or <strong>Data Manipulation Language</strong>. I’m not creating an object I’m manipulating the data inside that object. </p><p>In this course we are going to<strong> learn the basics</strong> of Transact-SQL or T-SQL. </p><p>We will cover the <strong>fundamentals</strong> of Transact using <strong>real world</strong> examples. Additionally, we will discuss some of the <strong>best practices</strong> associated with crafting clean, high performance code. </p><p>You’ll learn why <strong>stored procedures</strong> are so important to well-designed applications and why ad hoc queries aren’t. </p><p>The <strong>knowledge</strong> you gain from the <strong>course</strong> will not only help you learn to develop but will also give you a great first step to learning how to <strong>pinpoint</strong> <strong>performance</strong> issues due to poorly written code. </p><p><strong>Thanks</strong> for your interest in <strong>“Real World Transact-SQL from the Ground Up.”</strong></p><p><strong>See you in the course. </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p>",
