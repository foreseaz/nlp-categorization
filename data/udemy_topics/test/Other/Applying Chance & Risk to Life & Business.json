Many of us often regret decisions both big and small, but there are actually many ways we can improve our decision-making and risk management, and reduce the stress and regrets about decisions.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Content and Overview</strong></p><p style=\"\">In this course, our goal is to better understand randomness and uncertainty and learn tools to help us make more educated risks. We&#039;ll talk about the different biases we all experience in our intuitive thinking, and then learn how to re-train our brains to approach everyday problems differently. </p><p style=\"\">Using probability theory and a bit of math, we&#039;ll discuss how to make decisions rationally and efficiently. But don&#039;t worryâ€”no math background other than being able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply is required! We&#039;ll learn how to make better financial decisions, take smarter risks, and improve nearly every aspect of our lives. Each video is short and concise but filled with interesting and helpful material. Each one is animated, to ensure we grasp the concepts completely, and they all contain engaging, relatable real-life examples. Using these tools, anyone can learn to improve their decision-making, which leads to ultimately minimizing the number of regrets they have. If <em style=\"\">you&#039;d </em>like to live a more worry-free life with fewer regrets, this course is for you.</p>",
