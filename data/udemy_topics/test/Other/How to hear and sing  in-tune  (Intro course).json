Most of the ear training programs only focus on one thing – training your ears. They have absolutely nothing to do with the voice part (singing). Tune It Up! <strong style=\"\">combines both listening and singing, </strong>teaching your ears to hear “in-tune” and your voice to sing “in-tune.”  </p>  <p>  \t                  So why not, <strong style=\"\">&quot;</strong><strong style=\"\">Tune It Up!&quot;</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Full Tune It Up! course available at tuneitupcourse (.com) website.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    ________________________________________________________________  </p>  <p>  \t    TESTIMONIALS:  </p>  <p>  \t        I really enjoyed having voice lessons from Amy. At first I was a little hesitant just because I am shy with my voice. However, I got comfortable really quick and got out of my shell! I learned a lot about voice technique, too. I can reach higher notes without straining, and I know it&#039;s healthier for my voice. I am so happy with my lessons, and can&#039;t wait for more!     -Cora H.  </p>  <p>  \t    Over all I have really enjoyed the way Amy teaches. She always knows what to fix and how to fix it. She has definitely helped me improve a lot. - Whitney R.  </p>  <p>  \t    Tune It Up is a great course to help people train their ears and voice to be able to sing in tune better.  It takes practice but it is simple and helpful.  </p>  <p>  \t    -Gary D.  </p>  <p>  \t                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Tune It Up! </strong> is a singing and ear training curriculum designed to train your ears to listen &quot;In-Tune&quot; and your voice to sing &quot;In-Tune.&quot; This course offers a carefully planned sequence of musical exercises and songs designed to “tune-up” both your ears and voice.  </p>  <p>  \t             In the lessons you will learn how to train your ears to listen “in-tune” and your voice to sing “in-tune” through the use of vocal exercises, listening exercises, and songs, centered around the professionally-recognized ear and voice <em style=\"\">Kodaly concept of solfeggio (solfege or solfa)</em>, [Remember the “do, re, mi…” song from “Sound of Music”?] You will also learn the basics of music theory including: rhythm, reading music on a staff, key signatures, note names, and musical signs and symbols.  </p>  <p>  \t            Follow the lesson as instructed and, put together with consistent daily practice, your ears and voice will improve!  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\"> </strong><strong style=\"\">Join me now and let&#039;s, &quot;Tune-It Up!&quot;</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">_______________________________________________________</strong>  </p>",
