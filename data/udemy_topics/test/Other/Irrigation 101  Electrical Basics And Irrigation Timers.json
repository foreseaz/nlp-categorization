    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is a beginner&#039;s or entry level class on  a lawn sprinkler&#039;s electrical system. We cover the fundamental concepts of volts, amps, &amp; ohms and how to measure these at the timer. You&#039;ll receive a 4 step process to program any irrigation timer, whether AC or DC. Then we&#039;ll get specific about timers, covering all the features you need to program, troubleshoot, or maximize a system&#039;s efficiency. As always, I&#039;ve given you several real world skills that you can put into practice today; selecting and programming the right timer, properly splice sprinkler wiring, use a multimeter to troubleshoot an irrigation timer, and how to use a wire doubler.</p>",
