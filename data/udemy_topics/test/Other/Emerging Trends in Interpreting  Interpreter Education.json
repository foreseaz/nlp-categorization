    "description": "<p>Cathy Cogen and Dennis Cokely will report on their recent study of \nemerging trends in interpreting and implications for interpreter \neducation. The presentation will be organized into three primary \nsections: First, trends impacting current and future interpreting \nservices assesses external trend areas that are broad in nature and have\n many long-term implications for the field of professionals providing \nservices to individuals who are d/Deaf. Second, current issues in \nInterpreter Education describes several key dynamics at play within the \nfield that may facilitate or impede efforts to address future \ninterpreter education and professional development needs. Lastly, the \nfinal section of the presentation offers recommendations for aligning \ninterpreter education with the challenges of tomorrow. In many areas, \nthe recommendations mark a significant departure from old ways of doing \nbusiness. And we will issue a call to action, asking conference \nattendees to consider how they will participate â€“ as practitioners, \neducators, researchers, and administrators. What partnerships, \npractices, and policies will they engage in and support toward creating a\n better future?<br><br>NOTE: This presentation is delivered in American Sign Language.  There are captions, but no audio.  </p><p>This was a live-streamed presentation from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf National Convention in New Orleans, 2015.<br></p>",
