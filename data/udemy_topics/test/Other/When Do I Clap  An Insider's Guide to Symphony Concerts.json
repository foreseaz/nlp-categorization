    "description": "<p>  \t      When do I clap? That’s the one question about attending symphony concerts that almost everyone is too afraid to ask. Everybody has an opinion, but few people really know the answer.  </p>  <p>  \t      Imagine the following scenario:  </p>  <p>  \t      The music has ended and a few people are nervously clapping while others are giving them some serious stink-eye. You think, “Should I clap, or shouldn’t I?” It seems like everybody has the rule book except for you. You begin to panic.  </p>  <p>  \t      Relax — “When Do I Clap?” is here to help!  </p>  <p>  \t      Let GRAMMY® nominated classical musician Tom Peters help guide you though the ins and outs of attending a symphony concert. Tom brings nearly 30 years of experience playing in professional orchestras to give you an insider’s look at how symphony concerts work.  </p>  <p>  \t      This course teaches you all you need to know to be an insider in attending symphony concerts.
