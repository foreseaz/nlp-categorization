    "description": "<p><strong>What's this course about?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The complete, easy-to-follow course that takes anyone from iPhone or iPad novice to master in just a few hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What will you (or your parents) be able to do after the course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what your technical background is, I will guide you from removing the iPhone or iPad carefully from the box, inserting the SIM-card, setting the iPhone up, right through to creating an Apple-ID and free email address, to writing text messages and emails, taking photos and videos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a relaxed pace and with normal everyday language, we will master the most useful aspects of the iPhone, from navigating with Maps, to taking notes, setting up birthday reminders and using the calendar to offload and outsource a part of our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is this course for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOT ONLY GREAT FOR SENIORS!! A number of 30-40 year olds have benefited from the easy-to-follow, step-by-step learning method of this online course. We cover everything you need to know and leave out the unimportant things (to avoid overwhelming).</p><p>Have you noticed the difference in how the 50+ generation communicate versus the under 20s? Does your family live apart or perhaps overseas? Wouldn't you like to share those beautiful moments with your parents the way you do with your friends via your iPhone or iPad?<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please don't underestimate our Seniors. I have taught many to go from masters of snailmail and landline phones to being masters of their iPhone - believe me how proud they are when they can upload a photo to the iCloud shared album. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So often Seniors see smartphones with skepticism, but after going through this course, not one of them could imagine life without a smart phone, particularly due to the closeness they can reach with their grandkids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm proud to say, this course will get them there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
