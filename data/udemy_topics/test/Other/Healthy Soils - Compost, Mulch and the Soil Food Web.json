    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      This course is about the health and vitality of our gardens and of ourselves.  The old adage &quot;you are what you eat&quot; is never more evident than it is today. Everything we grow and consume starts with the soil our plants are grown on.  It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re vegan, vegetarian or eat meat - it all starts with soil.  This class will show you how to build your garden and landscape soils without the use of synthetic fertilizers. You will learn the reasons and benefits of compost and cover crops, and about feeding the soil to grow stronger, healthier vegetables, fruit and landscapes.  Separated into 10 lectures, we&#039;ll take the process step by step making it easy for you to follow and transform your garden from one of chemical dependence to one where nature handles much of the work for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      The course is structured as a series of PowerPoint and video lectures and finishes with a short quiz to reinforce your knowledge and confidence.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      You should take this course if you&#039;re interested in attracting pollinators to your vegetables and trees. You should take this course if you want to have a better understanding of how to become an organic gardener or landscaper.  You should take this course if you want to become a better steward of your land, water and air.  </p>",
