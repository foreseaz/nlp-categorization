    "description": "<p>  \t Join award-winning trainer and author Geoff Blake, as he takes you on a fun, fast-paced journey into Zen Cart e-commerce store customization in Ten Ton Zen Cart Customization Fundamentals! With his down to earth, no-nonsense style, Geoff gets you up and running, first by dissecting the Zen Cart storefront, then by quickly delving into the world of templates — where to find them, how to install them, and how to get them running in your store. Then, it’s deep into the admin console where you’ll learn how to adjust banner graphics, side boxes, columns, the login screen, and a whole lot more. Next, you’ll learn how to customize your store’s product pages, and also the shopping cart page. Geoff rounds off the course with a look at how to work with Zen Cart’s Define Pages, including how to use Zen Cart’s back-end page editor and how to edit PHP files directly, and finally Zen Cart’s EZ-Pages, where you’ll discover how to use the Developer’s Toolkit, customize navigation, and even begin integrating content from other sources, like Dreamweaver. Strap in for a session of fun and learning in Ten Ton Zen Cart Customization Fundamentals!  </p>",
