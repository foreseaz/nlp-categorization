These topic is getting very hot nowadays because these learning algorithms can be used in several fields from software engineering to crime investigation. </p><p>We will talk about the theoretical background for face recognition algorithm then we are going to implement these problems together.</p><p>The first chapter is about static face detection: at the end of the chapter we will be able to construct applications capable of detecting faces on static images or pictures. In the second chapter we will consider a real-time problem: how to be able to detect faces in real-time, for example on webcamera videos. </p>",
