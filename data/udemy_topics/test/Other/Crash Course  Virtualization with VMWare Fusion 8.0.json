I will create a Windows version soon.*</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Virtualization may be a new term to you, but it is becoming an important one. Whether you are a curious high school student wanting to try your hand at a Linux operating system, or an advanced individual working for an IT department in a large company, you can benefit from knowing how to properly setup a virtual computer system or network. This will be a <em><strong>crash course</strong></em> on the topic but you will be outfitted with the skills and tools needed to progress into more advanced information and with the right resources, setup a complete virtual computer lab in your home. </p><p><strong>Best student for the course:</strong></p><p>This course is an introduction to virtualization and a program called VMWare Fusion. Having no prior knowledge of what virtualization is will not limit your potential at learning this course, however it is recommended that you have prior knowledge in:</p><ol><li>Operating System installation</li><li>Optimizing a Windows computer</li><li>Managing resources on a computer</li></ol><p><strong>Why take this course?</strong><br></p><p>Anyone, regardless of age, that is remotely interested in a career in computer science is encouraged to enroll in this course. The idea of virtualization is becoming more and more prominent as we continue moving towards an 'always connected' society thanks to 'the cloud.' Having the knowledge of establishing and maintaining a virtualized computer system will be a valuable resource and help in advancing in your chosen field. </p><p><br></p>",
