    "description": "<p>  \t  Learn &amp; Master Sign Language will teach you all you need to know in order to master the beautiful language of American Sign Language. Professional instructors, Dr. Byron Bridges, and Stacey Webb, have designed each interactive lesson to give you a solid foundation in the basics and advanced signing. Each chapter provides basic lessons, quizzes with and without answers, vocabulary video index with each word taught in the lesson, fingerspelling practice at three different speeds, a section in each lesson on varying numbers, book activities, narrative practice, dialogue practice, and highlight and tips about deaf culture.  </p>  <p>  \t  Learn &amp; Master Sign Language contains 25 sessions on 25 professionally produced instructional DVDs, a detailed Lesson Book that follows the sessions, and access to the free online student support site. It is the only instructional package you&#039;ll ever need to master the receptive and the expressive components of sign language. After completing this course, you&#039;ll be able to communicate within deaf culture with confidence.  </p>  <h4>Our Mission: <em>Bringing Personal Dreams Within Reach</em></h4>  <p>  \t  Since most of us have that something we&#039;ve always wanted to learn-- speak a language, to paint, or dance, or play an instrument. These are personal dreams we hold dear, but as time passes and life gets in the way, these dreams can sometimes slip farther and farther out of reach. Formal schooling is often out of the question for busy adults. Private lessons are pricey and inconvenient. So how do we re-kindle these dreams and make them come true? That is the mission of Legacy Learning Systems: To make difficult skills accessible through multimedia self-education courses and bring personal dreams within reach.  </p>  <h4>What Should You Expect from the Learn &amp; Master Sign Language course?</h4>  <p>  \t<strong>Everything is in One Place</strong> — With L&amp;M Sign Language, your lessons are laid out in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step progression with everything you need in one place. Each lesson builds on the lesson before it, so you won’t miss anything. No need to buy countless training videos from a patchwork of sources.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>A Comprehensive Course</strong> — Even though this course is designed for beginners, it takes you far beyond the basics of the typical instructional DVD. We get you started quickly, but your lessons will take you as far along the path to mastery as you care to go. You won&#039;t find a more comprehensive multimedia training course for sign language anywhere!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Support Along the Way</strong> — Perhaps the most important thing is that you won&#039;t have to learn alone. Our online support community is an integral part of the learning process and is free for all of our students.  The instructors will be on the Discussion Boards and will be there for you when you have questions or need encouragement. Students who participate in this community are able to discuss their progress, post their questions (and recordings), as well as interact with other students as much they wish. Our job is not finished when you buy the Learn &amp; Master Sign Language course. It is done when you have reached your dream of communicating with others using American Sign Language.  </p>",
