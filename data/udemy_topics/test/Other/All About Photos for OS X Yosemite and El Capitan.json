    "description": "<p>What happened to iPhoto? Were you confused after updating your Mac? Apple's new Photos application for OS X Yosemite and El Capitan is fast and powerful, but quite different from iPhoto. This course will familiarize you with all of Photos' features and capabilities so you'll be organizing, editing and sharing like a pro! We'll be covering the Photos Library, importing, iCloud, organizing and editing photos. Then, we'll show you how to and share your photos via Facebook, Shutterfly and iCloud. This course is broken down into 32 videos that can be completed in segments or fully in about two hours. This course was formulated by The MacSpa's team of Apple training professionals who have over thirty years cumulated Apple product experience. </p>",
