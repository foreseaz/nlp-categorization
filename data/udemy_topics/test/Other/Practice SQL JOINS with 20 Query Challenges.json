    "description": "<p>Ready for more SQL practice?</p><p>\"Practice SQL JOINS With 20 Query Challenges\" is the next step in your journey to master SQL. </p><p>In our first course, \"Learn SQL Fundamentals With 10 Practice Problems\", we covered the basics of making a query, filtering, joins, and subqueries. It was a great start, but you are going to need more if you really want to get a job in SQL. </p><p>In this course, we focus specifically on taking your skill with making JOINS to the next level! Each problem will require you to form a JOIN, and sometimes you'll have to 4-5 JOINS to get the right answer. But don't worry, as always, you can check out our video explanations if you get stuck.</p><p>Just like our intro course, there are two parts to this course - the videos, and the actual hands-on practice. The Udemy course only gets you access to the video overview of each query challenge - to actually try your hand at the query challenges, you need to sign up on our website (this is free, we show you how to do it in the first lecture). Once you finish a challenge (or if you get stuck), check back on the Udemy videos to see how we did it.<br></p><p>This is an intermediate level course for people who already have a basic understanding of how SQL works. Now don't let that scare you away if you are a gung-ho beginner - just know that if that is you, you are going to have to learn quick and be willing to search terms if you don't recognize them.</p>",
