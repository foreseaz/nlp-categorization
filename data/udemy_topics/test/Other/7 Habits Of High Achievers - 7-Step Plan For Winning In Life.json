I wish I had learned this as a  teenager, my life would have been so much better! Highly recommended.&quot;  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  If you want to discover a proven, 7-step formula for success, then this is the course for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    As a 30-year student of         success, I have invested tens of thousands of dollars in seminars,         webinars, eBooks, training and courses to discover these proven         strategies and habits for my own life.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     These are the same exact habits that I&#039;ve learned and implemented. (turning them into millions) and have been fortunate to see which strategies work and which         don&#039;t. These habits have been proven in the real world.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">As a         result of this practical, 30-year study into what it takes to be         successful, I have determined that success         really boils down to 2 main elements...</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">1. Your         Attitude / Mindset (your &quot;Inner Game&quot;) and</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">2. Your           Actions / Activity (your &quot;Outer Game&quot;)</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If you&#039;ve got a <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">great         mindset / attitude</em></strong> and you add to that <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">massive action in a         strategic way</em></strong>, you cannot help but be fantastically successful.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Unfortunately, so often, we invest         a lot of our time         in learning strategies and technique, but then we fail to         support those strategies by having the correct mindset, attitudes and expectations,         so we         still lose.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The strategies may be great         and may actually work,         but when you try them without having the right mindset for success, you         won&#039;t take them (or yourself) to their fullest potential.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Many people believe that         knowledge is power. But that isn&#039;t entirely accurate.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Knowledge by itself isn&#039;t         power. In this course I am going to show you this critical success         formula:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Knowledge         + __________ + _______ _____ = POWER</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><br style=\"\">  \t</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What If You Absolutely         Knew You Could Not Fail?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Think about it...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you absolutely knew that         you could not fail, how much more action would you take?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Probably a LOT more, right?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you absolutely knew that         you had a proven gameplan that was unstoppable - a strategy that you had 100%         faith in - you would take action on it and do it to the fullest, right?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    So what&#039;s stopping us?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Unfortunately for many         people, they don&#039;t have the <em style=\"\">FORMULA FOR SUCCESS </em>yet, so they never reach the incredible heights of         success that they <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">deserve</em></strong> <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">and know</em></strong> they can achieve!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">In this enlightening         multimedia training, you are going to discover:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">What is the formula for             mastery?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What is the Number 1             driver of success?
