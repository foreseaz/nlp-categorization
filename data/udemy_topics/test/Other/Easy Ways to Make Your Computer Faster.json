No special skills are required, only basic computer skills are needed. Emphasis was put on making material easy to understand and implement. A faster PC means more work done in less time, less aggravation &amp; stress, money saved (instead of buying a new system try this!), more free time, and much more. Anyone from business owners to students, stay at home moms, gamers, and everyone in-between can use this and reap the benefits.</p>",
