And that&#039;s without improving your current website, portfolio, marketing, etc. All it takes is some thought and an hour on a word processor.</p><p style=\"\">I spent 15 years in sales and marketing before I launched my photography business in 2006. Unlike most photographers - who are obsessed with cameras, lenses and photography technique - I have always been obsessed with business. From day one I was experimenting with marketing, pricing and sales to find out how to make the most money I possibly could with wedding photography.</p><p style=\"\">Using this system I went from earning $0 on my first wedding to averaging <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">over $5,000</strong></em> per wedding within my first <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">2 years</strong></em> in business. </p><p style=\"\">In this course I will show you <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">exactly</strong></em> how to lay out your pricing. You&#039;ll learn:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">the 10 most important principles for wedding pricing success</li><li style=\"\">how to set your starting price</li><li style=\"\">when and how to raise (or lower) your prices</li><li style=\"\">how to build wedding packages that work</li><li style=\"\">how to sell more album packages</li><li style=\"\">how to make sure you don&#039;t get &quot;bargained down&quot; with every single wedding</li><li style=\"\">how to handle down-payments and refunds</li></ul>There&#039;s no fluff and no padding in this course. It&#039;s not a minute longer than it needs to be for you to learn the system. I&#039;ll walk you <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">step-by-step</em></strong> through the entire pricing process. Nothing will be left to guesswork.And if you have any questions that are not answered in the course, I&#039;ll be there to answer them in the discussion section of the course. Every wedding you book without using the methods in this course is <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">costing you money!</strong></em> So don&#039;t delay and please enroll now.  ",
