These principles are the essence of: <strong>Self-Leadership</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>1 PRINCIPLE ONE – BE PURPOSEFUL. </strong>Having a clear purpose simply means to know what you want. Once you understand what you really, really want (this may be challenging) you will instantaneously have a direction to move in. This is the first step in both leadership and self-leadership.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>2 PRINCIPLE TWO –</strong> <strong>BELIEF</strong>. This is one of the most important topics of all. Without belief one will not accomplish any significant achievements. What we believe shapes our reality. Believe in yourself, believe in others, believe in a higher power.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>3 PRINCIPLE THREE </strong>– <strong>COMMUNICATION</strong>. Communication plays too important a role. All excellent leaders, marketers, politicians, lawyers, teachers, etc. are proficient at communication. This is an area where we should pay attention and strive to improve constantly.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>4 PRINCIPLE FOUR </strong>– <strong>POSITIVISM</strong>. We are attracted by positive people. Emotions are contagious – positive and negative. Positivism does not mean blind optimism. Not being positive in some cases may be considered as a lack of confidence. No confidence – no results.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>5 PRINCIPLE FIVE </strong>– <strong>THINKING</strong>. Successful people think in a different from the masses way. There are different types of thinking. Our mindset determines if we are going to be successful or not. We should be constantly working on it. There are essentially two ways to improve your thinking – the people you meet and the books you read. (an old saying)</p>  <p>  \t<strong>6 PRINCIPLE SIX </strong>– <strong>GOALS. </strong>This is how you become purposeful (principle 1) by having goals. There are some key moments that we have to take into consideration when we set goals. Most importantly, our goals must be specific, detailed and written down.</p>  <p>  \t<strong>7 PRINCIPLE SEVEN </strong>– <strong>EDUCATION</strong>. When it comes to personal development, many people just want to become successful – we all would love to win, but how many of us love to train? Successful people (including leaders) educate themselves constantly. Do not miss an opportunity to learn something new every day!  </p><p><strong>WHAT DO STUDENTS SAY ABOUT THE COURSE?</strong><br></p><p><strong>\"<em>Vladimir Raykov is the best instructor on Udemy</em></strong></p><p><em>Introspective, insightful and inspiring comes to mind when taking this course.

I felt a need of a system to guide us towards the accomplishment of our personal and meaningful goals.

The system has four elements – the last three from the list above plus belief.</p>  <p>  \t<strong>                                        Thinking --&gt; Goals --&gt; Belief --&gt; Education</strong></p>  <p>  \t                                    Everything that you will learn in this course has been <strong>tried and tested</strong>.
