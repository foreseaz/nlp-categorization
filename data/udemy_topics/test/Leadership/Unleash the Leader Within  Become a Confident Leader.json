    "description": "<p><strong>With over 21 hours of content and 131 lectures and exercises, this is the most extensive Leadership Training on Udemy...and the same approach I use with CEOs of Fortune 500 Companies</strong><br></p><p><em>What if I told you that tomorrow you will stand in front of a room full of thousands of people, their attention 100% focused on you for a full hourâ€¦how would you feel?</em></p><p>Would you be able to command attention, to speak confidently, to lead? Or would you be left stumbling over your words and tripping yourself up mentally because of fear and anxiety?</p><p>So many of us imagine our abilities to be leaders and to make an impact on others, yet so few of us fully live up to that potential. This course is about overcoming the barriers, internally and externally to allow you be that charismatic, awe-inspiring leader you wish to be.</p><p>For years I have been working with high-end executives and fortune 500 companies developing the types of techniques you'll find in this course.</p><p><strong>You will learn surefire ways to:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Overcome your fear of public speaking<br></em></li><li><em>Develop influential body language<br></em></li><li><em>Develop your emotional intelligence<br></em></li><li><em>Develop irresistible charisma<br></em></li><li><em>Be comfortable dealing with chaos and conflict<br></em></li><li><em>Become the confident leader you were destined to be</em></li></ul><p><strong>WARNING</strong><strong>:</strong> This course contains over 21 hours of high quality audio and video! If you are looking for a 45 minute course that just makes you feel warm and fuzzy, this course is NOT for you. This course is about making REAL changes to your brain and to your life!</p><p>This course is based on the exact framework that both I and my clients have been using to fantastic results for years. The same strategies that CEO's, public speakers, presidents, and community leaders use to be influencers and world-shakers.</p><p>The truth is, anxiety and internal barriers will always hold you back from becoming the inspiring leader you have the potential to be, unless you actively deal with them. And you don't learn these things in graduate school, business school, or corporate training. But you can bet the person who has gone through this process will be the better salesperson, the better CEO, the better leader.</p><p><strong>Some key elements of this process include:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Finding your subconscious barriers, understanding them, and learning how to remove them<br></em></li><li><em>How to literally \"retrain\" your brain to avoid negative patterns...exercises included in this course<br></em></li><li><em>Transforming the same triggers that used to make you feel weak and anxious into ones that make you feel powerful and confident<br></em></li><li><em>Strategies for using your body language to control the way you think and feel</em></li></ul><p>And a whole lot more in over 21 hours of content which will create permanent, positive changes in how you think and feel. Think you are up for it?</p><p>&gt;&gt;Take this course, and execute on it, and it will change your life.
