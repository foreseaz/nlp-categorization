You can learn a lot about a person through who they spend time around, as well as their environment. We'll talk about how to model a person's timeline as well, so you don't miss out on influential experiences earlier in you model's life.</p><p>The middle layer is behavior and skills. We'll talk about how to deconstruct skills and figure out what bodies of knowledge your model is drawing from so that you can replicate these knowledge centers in your own brain. We'll also cover how to find the right words to use to find information on the skill you are modeling. You need to be aware of the 3 different kinds of vocabularies that are available for describing any skill.</p><p>The deepest layer is saved for last. This is where we go into the values and beliefs and identity of the model. You'll learn what values are and why they matter in your model. You'll also learn why identity matters and why it's important to make sure you get beyond the public face of your model to truly understand who they are. You'll learn how identity functions as a social and group concept so that you can understand how you model's identity is shaped by the groups they spend time with.</p><p>Finally, you can use the discussion section, or send me a Private Message, if you want advice or help with modeling the skills of a specific person. </p><p>See you in the course,</p><p>Timothy</p><p><br></p>",
