Heaps of practical examples that can be applied to your day-to-day life.You will be better off </em><em>for taking this course. Money well spent!</em></p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p>I was inspired in this topic after attending a NVC couples weekend. I learned how quickly you can learn to connect in a meaningful way with your fellow humans, but also how subtly our language includes violence and judgement.</p><p>In this course you will learn about the empathy cards resource as well as the subtleties that make Non Violent Communication such a powerful way off connecting. This has been a profound, yet simple, way to improve emotional intelligence.</p><p>I am a counselor, husband, and father and this course is absolutely relevant to all these aspects of my life. </p><p>After taking this course you will have the skills to better connect with yourself, and also the self awareness to be able express yourself without muddying your message with the violence and judgement that are such a natural part of our language.</p><p>You will learn how to use the 'feeling and needs' empathy cards and how they fit into the Non Violent Communication Dance Floor.</p><p>You will also Integrate the NVC philosophy with you personal style of helping by watching applied lectures and demonstrations.</p><p><strong>Course Outline:</strong>Section 1: The Cards and Empathy</p><p>Section 2: The Dance Floor</p><p>Section 3: Applications</p><p>Section 4: GratitudeI actually think that the best way to learn anything is experience - and for this topic - I think that's especially true. So, take the time to practice the skills being taught, and even better, get along to a local NVC practice group or course and experience the magic for yourself.</p><p><strong>Bonus Materials:</strong></p><ul><li>You will get a copy of the NVC Dance floor to download and print.</li><li>You will get a copy of common faux feelings and/or feelings that blame.</li></ul>",
