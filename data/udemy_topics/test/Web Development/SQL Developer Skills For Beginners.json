The virtual labs comes with Microsoft Server 2012 and also Microsoft SQL Server 2016 and various instances of SQL Server like SQL Server Analysis Server (SSAS), SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS),SQL Server Integration service  (SSIS). The virtual labs is ideal because it is free and gives you an environment that mirrors a real world production SQL Server environment. I strongly urge you to take advantage of this opportunity as I do not know how long Microsoft will have these virtual labs available for. All you require to access the virtual labs is a web browser . It does not matter if you are using a mac , Pc or Linux and there is absolutely nothing for you to install. The lab exercise you will perform in this course using the virtual labs are similar to a real world SQL Server production environment.</p>\n\n<p>What you will learn in this course includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li>How to create databases</li><li>How to create Tables</li><li>How to deseign databases</li><li>How to design Tables</li><li>How to create flat file database </li><li>How to use SSMS Tool</li><li>How to write basic T-SQL Queries</li></ul>\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing on the course.</p>\n\n<p>Thank You</p>",
