    "description": "<p>Are you looking to start out in web development, or are you a front end developer, with some HTML and CSS skills but looking to branch out further into JavaScript, well this is definitely the course for you.</p><p>In this course, I will walk you though developing your own, <strong style=\"\">Responsive</strong> and <strong style=\"\">Interactive</strong> website from scratch. And when I say scratch, I mean it. Unlike some lessons and courses out there on the Internet, this course shows you how to build everything, without using any bloated frameworks, plug ins, libraries, or even jQuery. You will be learning everything from the bare bones.</p><p><strong style=\"\">How this course is taught</strong><br style=\"\"></p><p>I have been a web developer now for over 8 years, but I was once in your shoes, and I have created my course, based on how I and other developers would have liked to learn web development.</p><p>Every video goes straight into coding and creating an amazing site. I have done away with any guff or filler that you may find on other learning materials and create a no nonsense course. There are no confusing lessons nor any ramblings. There is just honest and direct teaching that I am sure you will love.</p><p>I have split this course into 3 sections.</p><p><strong style=\"\">HTML </strong>The foundations of any webpage. The HTML is the content of your site, and I help you build and layout your site in the correct method. Also the HTML will be SEO optimised as we use the correct elements for each section.<br style=\"\"></p><p><strong style=\"\">CSS </strong>This is what makes your site look awesome and visually pleasing. The course goes through how to style your site efficiently. We go through things like reset CSS to give a constant look across browsers, without any bloat.</p><p>Also the lessons will go through using the correct selectors, to target specific elements that you want to style.</p><p>Finally we will be making our site responsive, by using different methods, such as percentages and media queries, to make your site look amazing no matter if you are viewing it on a desktop, tablet or mobile.</p><p><strong style=\"\">JavaScript </strong>My favourite section. The course will show you exactly how to program common components found on most websites, just using plain JavaScript. Once you finish with my course, you will be able to build your own,<br style=\"\"></p><ul style=\"\"><li>Responsive Sliders</li><li>Reveal mores</li><li>Contact us form, which sends real emails.</li></ul><p>You will be able to build these components from scratch using plain JavaScript, without any dependences (such as jQuery).
