    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tThe tutorial starts off with configuring the required components:  PrimeFaces, NetBeans, MongoDB, MongoVUE, JSF, and Spring. You then go on  to develop a very basic JSF and PrimeFaces UI for your website using  Spring and Mongo running on a Tomcat server. Next you will upgrade the  website using more features like the creation of the data administration  pages and securing the administration pages. Finally you will use CSS  and JSF templates to finish off a functional database-driven website  with a beautiful and neat interface.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis set of videos will show you how to take full advantage of  PrimeFaces by coupling it with JSF, Spring, and MongoDB to create a user  interface that meets your demands of flexibility and extensibility.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Kobus</strong> has been programming since the age of 11. He has worked with  Visual Basic, Delphi, and Waba, and wrote probably one of the first  databases for the Palm OS and Windows CE machines. He then moved on to  Java development using J2EE. From South African Breweries to Discovery Life, he has worked with a  variety of organizations. Currently he is working at Flight Centre Australia where his main task  is to develop and maintain a system that is written in Java, Spring, and  PrimeFaces. In his spare time, he has been involved in projects like building a bomb  prop for his business and  a battlebox. It is while  working on such projects that he stumbled upon the DLP 3D printer  technology. He then designed his own DLP-based 3D printer that is  currently in the prototype stage.  </p>",
