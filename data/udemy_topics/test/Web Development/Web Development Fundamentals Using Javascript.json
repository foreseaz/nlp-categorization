    "description": "<p>  \tNowadays, it&#039;s difficult to find a popular website that doesn&#039;t use Javascript and Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are just a few examples of it. If you heard about Java or Javascript but never used it or don&#039;t know what you can do with it, this is the right course for you. JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it&#039;s up to the browser to do something with it.  </p>  <p>  \tThe fact that the script is in the HTML page means that your scripts can be seen and copied by whoever views your page. Nonetheless, to my mind this openness is a great advantage, because the flip side is that you can view, study and use any JavaScript you encounter on the Word Wide Web.  </p>  <p>  \tJavaScript can be used in other contexts than a Web browser. Netscape created server-side JavaScript as a CGI-language that can do roughly the same as Perl or ASP. There is no reason why JavaScript couldn’t be used to write real, complex programs. However, this site exclusively deals with the use of JavaScript in web browsers. If you don’t have any programming experience at all it’s best to start with some gentle JavaScript examples that teach you the basics.  </p>  <p>  \tThis can be your starting point to create effects on interactive websites. If you are passionate about creating modern web pages, then you can get started here and take your learning to the next level. Please note: basic knowledge of HTML is preferred before starting this course. As mentioned, Javascript codes are typically written within HTML tags. Don&#039;t wait any longer to get hands-on knowledge on the most popular Javascript techniques.  </p>",
