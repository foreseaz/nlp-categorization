You will be learning how to use these languages to develop a basic website. With enough work and effort, this course will take around 2-3 weeks to complete. The course will start out with the basics, eventually incorporating all the techniques you have learned into a full-blown website. If you are just wanting to learn a bit of programming, or you eventually want to take a profession in web development, this is the perfect place to start.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course is split into three sections, a introduction and basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript section, a section for more intermediate topics, and finally, a cumulative section where we&#039;ll build a website from scratch.  </p>",
