    "description": "<p style=\"\">As the web evolves, more and more complexity is moving to the front-end. A new trend called no-backend seeks to shy away from the traditional server-side web development in favor of utilizing cloud-based backend technologies like Firebase, allowing developers to focus on important business logic rather than boilerplate backend code.</p><p style=\"\">The web moves fast but with Firebase you can move faster by unlocking the power of real-time communication without the burden of server-side development. It will have you questioning everything you&#039;ve been told about what web development is supposed to be and unlock a productivity gain you only get a few times in your career.</p><p style=\"\">Learning Firebase will teach you how to develop fully featured real-time applications using Firebase in the friendliest and most intuitive way possible, by walking through examples using the Firebase dashboard and API.</p><p style=\"\">From the word go you will start to craft a sophisticated real-time link sharing application as a means of applying Firebase concepts exactly as they would be for any other viable application. You will be introduced to the amazing real-time data browser, which you will use extensively throughout the course, as you go hands on with the most important features of Firebase. As you move ahead you&#039;ll learn how to create, read, update, and delete data. You&#039;ll also become familiar with adding and managing user accounts, securing your data, and unlocking its full potential. You&#039;ll apply the knowledge gained to your own application to solidify the concepts and be inspired to explore topics beyond the scope of this course.</p><p style=\"\">By the end of the course, you will have created a full-blown real-time app and be rest assured that it will be the first of many to come!</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About The Author</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Mark Nutter </strong>is a Minneapolis-based software engineer and the father of two lovely girls.
