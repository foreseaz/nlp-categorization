    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \tGetting Started with Apache Maven will introduce you to the world of synergized development in the Maven ecosystem. The course logically explains the various concepts of the tool, and shows how to proceed from simple assignments to complex ones.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Maven is not simply a tool to invoke compilers and utilities, but it is also an approach to easily constructing your project by accessing its ever-expanding world of tools and libraries.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   You will learn how to pull in dependencies simply by specifying their coordinates, how to customize your lifecycle with plugins, and see how easy it can be to create a project website. You will see how to generate reports on your code that will enable understanding and will let you know when your developers are running into problems. You will understand how to scale up from simple projects to multi-module ones.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   This video course walks you through the steps by presenting examples, starting with very basic ones, and growing to more elaborate ones once you have mastered the basics.  </p>  <h4><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Russell Gold</strong> has been a Java developer since 1996 and is the author of the open-source project, HttpUnit, as well as a handful of smaller open source projects.
