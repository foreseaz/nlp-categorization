    "description": "<p>Material Design is a design language introduced by Google to unify user experience across all their products on any platform. Material Design is one of those many other types of designing languages like Flat Design, Metro Design, Realism Design etc. Material Design does differ to other types in terms of colors, typography, shapes, patterns and layout. But Material Design adds something very new to design language i.e, Motion and Stacking.</p><p>Google encourages developers to use Material Design to design their websites and apps because it let's you create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation.</p><p>In this course you will learn to design websites and hybrid apps using Material Design from scratch. We will create a portfolio site with multiple pages. Then we will learn designing hybrid apps using Material design by deploying the same site on Cordova container. Let's get started.</p>",
