This includes: <strong style=\"\">creating and scaffolding</strong> the rails application with full CRUD functionality, building out the <strong style=\"\">upload configuration files</strong> and <strong style=\"\">dynamic sizing</strong> methods, connecting to the <strong style=\"\">Amazon S3 CDN</strong> server for both uploading and downloading files for the application, building out the view files in the application to<strong style=\"\"> render the images</strong>, and much more. At the end I&#039;ve also included an introduction to <strong style=\"\">RSpec testing</strong> and how to integrate it into the application.</p><p style=\"\">The frameworks, systems, and libraries you will learn how to use in this course are:</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Ruby on Rails</strong>, version 4.2</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Carrierwave</strong> for file upload processing</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS) CDN API for storing and retrieving image files</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Figaro</strong> for secure credential management</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Fog</strong> for AWS API connections</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Rspec</strong> for automated testing</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">MiniMagick</strong> for dynamically manipulating file sizes</li><li style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">ActiveRecord</strong> for managing database migrations and queries</li><li style=\"\">And the processes associated with building a real Ruby on Rails web application!</li></ul><div style=\"\">By the end of this course you will be able to create a fully functional image uploading application, you can either extend it&#039;s functionality to turn it into something that fits your needs, or leverage the processes to include photo uploading and management into your own applications.</div><div style=\"\">All of the source code for the working application is available for students to review and use.</div><div style=\"\">Finally, it&#039;s my goal that all students are able to get through the course successfully, and I therefore check the course message board daily and assist students through any parts of the course.</div>",
