    "description": "<p>  \t                                Content Management Systems (CMS&#039;s) help you create and manage your website on-line. This course will guide you through using <strong>MODX </strong>to build and maintain your website with <strong>total creative freedom</strong>.  </p>  <p>  \t              Why does MODX win out over other CMS&#039;s? Too often they get in the way. You want to add something but you have to add it as a &quot;widget&quot; or a &quot;block&quot;. You want to change the layout of your site but you don&#039;t have access to the code. MODX<strong> </strong>changes all that, you have total control over the code.  </p>  <p>  \t                You may be familiar with <strong>Drupal</strong>, <strong>Joomla</strong> and <strong>Wordpress, </strong>while these are good at what they do, they all have their limitations. <strong>MODX </strong>is different, you are unrestrained, you can design your website exactly how you want, to look like you want it to look and do what you want it to do.  </p>  <p>  \t                                 This course introduces you to the basic concepts of the MODX content management system<strong> </strong>so you can get up and running with a website that is totally under your control in no time at all.
