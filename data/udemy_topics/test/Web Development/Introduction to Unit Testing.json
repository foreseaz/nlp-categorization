    "description": "<p>  \t    Testing and debugging are places where developers spend a lot of their time. Code doesn’t always perform as expected and, with complex applications, it’s very easy to break code with minor changes. Unit tests and test-driven-development exist to help us manage expectations of our functionality and to ensure that other developers working on our code are aware when a change they made affects already existing functionality. This is very important when working on large projects with many collaborators as well as small projects with few developers.  </p>  <p>  \t    We’ll be pre-writing tests in code that we can run whenever we make updates to our application. This will ensure that no new logic breaks old logic, and that we are certain that our programs are executing properly when given different inputs.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Includes:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>11 videos with over 90 minutes of lectures and explanations.</li>  \t<li>1 external resource file.</li>  \t<li>4 exercises to help you master testing concepts.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What You&#039;ll Learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>What is Unit Testing?</li>  \t<li>Test driven development</li>  \t<li>Using Assert</li>  \t<li>Jasmine testing framework</li>  \t<li>Additional Resources</li>  \t<li>Exercises</li>  \t<li>And More!</li>  </ul>",
