    "description": "<p>  \t   In this course, I will explain how a Lucky Draw program was created using Flash. This program can be used in events to conduct lucky draws and display the names of the winners on the screen. I have used this program successfully in my organisation on two occasions and have received feedback that this was a useful and nifty program for conducting Lucky Draws instead or picking pieces of paper from a bowl which is the usual practice.  </p>  <p>  \t   Some features of the program are:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Reading in a name list from a text file</li>  \t<li>Drum roll sound effects</li>  \t<li>Clicking a button to draw each prize</li>  \t<li>Random selection of winners</li>  \t<li>Random names displayed on screen for eye candy</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t   This program is easily customisable to suit your requirements. You will to know some basic ActionScript and have the Adobe Flash software to be able to modify this program.  </p>",
