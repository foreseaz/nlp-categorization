This course will cover the details of installing and configuring of the DNN websites.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the DNN is an open source content management system built on the .NET platform. You can customize it easily and you can extended it as you like. The DNN is a flexible CMS management and has a long history and great support and number of features.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend starting using the DNN for .NET developer. It can save you a huge amount of time as a lot of features are already there and you just need to connect to the DNN api to use it.<br></p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you about my experience with DNN. I've made two live and well made sites with it. It was very generous with features and using it api and customize it was very easy and helpful. Going from scratch isn't always the answer so it can help you save a ton of time, literary. </p>\n\n<p>You will see in this course how to work with the DNN site and configure it's different parts, so you can jump start your DNN usage and get to see what it has to offer before going and use it.</p>\n\n<p>This course will start by simple tasks, then gradually go advance. We will dig deeper as you progress in this course.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I'm more than happy to offer you help and support for your work with the DNN, so please share with me and the students of this class what you have problems in the course discussion and you will get a highly professional and once an Olympic gold winner (okay maybe I took too far with the Olympic thing :P) to help you and walk through your problems until you see success.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you have any sections you would like to see this course has please don't hesitate to contact me or use the class discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you join and enjoy this course.
