    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Knockout is a JavaScript MVVM (Model View ViewModel) library that helps you create rich, dynamic user interfaces with clean, maintainable code. Moreover, Knockout automatically updates the UI when your data model state changes, ridding you of the need to refresh the page. As a developer, discover how you can use KnockoutJS to architect a complete single page web application from start to finish while maintaining its structure and flexibility! </span>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course walks you through the process of creating a real-life web application using the MVVM pattern to add functionality to the code as it evolves. If your JavaScript often turns into a giant convoluted mess while building an application with Knockout, this video course will give you an insight on how to organize your code to avoid this.  </p>  <p>  \tStarting with an overview of the core concepts behind KnockoutJS to create a real-world application, you&#039;ll begin your journey by first learning to build a simplified version of Google Docs. You&#039;ll discover the power of data binding and dependency tracking to automatically keep various parts of your application in sync. Next, you’ll learn how you can use debugging techniques to track errors before moving on to creating a spreadsheet to represent more complex data structures. Lastly, you’ll learn how to create a form and then save and load a page using server side functionality.  </p>  <p>  \tThe final section of the course lets you explore best practices and some additional tools you can use to ensure a maintainable code base.  </p>",
