I think the question should be, do you want your applications or websites to be awesome? Or course we do, right? YES.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I don't like to show off, but my students love me, and I love them, here are some of the reviews</strong><strong> I get.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>The Best Teacher ever</em>  </p>\n\n<p><em>Edwin Diaz i am a newbie and now i am writing php syntax :D awesome and your lectures and jokes are awesome. They help me to motivate and learn by doing :).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Groovy Goodness</em></p>\n\n<p><em>If code is boring you to death or you wonder just what the buzz about Bootstrap, then hold on and take a ride with Edwin in this fun and very informative class. Clear, professional quality. I dare you not to smile after taking this class.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>FANTASTIC!!</em></p>\n\n<p><em>You're a very good teacher, you made it very simple and easy to understand, thank you so much, I want to learn more about bootstrap because the course was too short, but anyway great job.
