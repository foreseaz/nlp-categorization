    "description": "<p>WordPress has revolutionized the way we build websites. No more tedious long coding practices, but rather you can now select or unselect the items you want on your website. The more complex the website, the simpler the codes.</p>\n\n<p>Although creating a website in today’s day and age has become easier, making it unique and different has become even more difficult. If you don’t want your website to become lost in the sea of websites, you will have to make it stand out.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>WordPress Themes are one way you can do that, the more interactive and interesting your website is, the more attention it will garner. If you have a basic idea of how to code or know how write in PHP, HTML5 and CSS, well then this course can definitely get you started on your road to creating fantastic new themes for your next website.\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>The course will combine your basic knowledge of HTML 5, CSS and PHP and will show you how you use the different APIs and widgets from WordPress to create awesome new themes. The WordPress Themes course will cover functions such as PostLoop, Hook/Actions, Widgets, WP_Query, Theme Customizer API, and WordPress Frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Ink, Gridism and W3. \n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Not only will you learn the theory behind the technology, but you will also build 10 different themes also with the instructor.
