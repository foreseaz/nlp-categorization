    "description": "<p>Colors have been around the Web since the very early days. Before the birth of CSS, color attributes were baked into HTML or into images. As the Web evolved and moved into a CSS-friendly world, colors were extracted and moved into style files. Colors are at the very heart of display and graphical representations. It's critical for any developer or web designer to understand colors and their relationships in-depth, so that they can be more creative and gain control over the style and design of their websites.</p><p>Mastering CSS3 Colors aims to introduce ways you can control color using CSS3 features and shows you how to become artistic to create stunning web pages.</p><p>We will start off with understanding how color systems work and more importantly how we need to work with them. We will get to know all about core colors, web-safe colors, and named colors. We'll then dive into creating color profiles in RGB and HSL, and also learn how to incorporate alpha channels into these profiles. We’ll learn all the neat tricks to pick perfect color themes for our pages using external images, Adobe Color CC, and ColorZilla.</p><p>Next we'll turn our attention to relative colors and the use of currentColor, transparency, and gradients, making our sites fancier than ever. Finally, we’ll look at web accessibility and make our site user-friendly for everyone.</p><p>Before you know it, Mastering CSS3 Colors will have you up-to-speed with the best tricks and hacks to create captivating web pages, faster and more effectively than ever.</p><p><strong>About The Author</strong></p><p><strong>Ben Fhala </strong>discovered his passion for data visualization while he was working at Parsons in New York, in their data visualization department, PIIM.
