It’s definitely possible with the Play Framework.</p>\n\n<p>The Play Framework is a web application framework, written for Java and Scala that allows hot code reloading (write code in the editor and render directly in the browser). Any changes that are made to the code, are simultaneously modified directly in the browser. So, no more edits and recompilation for any of your codes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to hot code reloading, Play offers some significant advantages over other frameworks including being fully RESTful, has integrated unit testing, includes many Java APIs, all controller points are declared static, has asynchronous I/O and even has native Scala support. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With so much to offer, no wonder it is quickly rising the ranks as one of the best Java frameworks to work with. So, where can you get your hands on learning this amazing software? In this course, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This Play Framework tutorial will teach you everything you need to know about the Play Framework. From basic fundamentals such as downloading the development environment to writing scripts to even creating design principles for a real application in the framework, this course has it all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Learn all the benefits Play has to offer to your development needs including its full stack nature, utilize its many libraries and even take advantage of its seamless error handling process. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this comprehensive course, you will learn everything about Play from start to finish, including starting with how to set up the play environment with activator, how to write play test using TypeSafe, how to set up backend and frontend configuration and components, persistence and database components, HTML5 configuration and components, security components, design principles for applications, support for modular applications, distributed real time application configuration and components and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So? Enroll now and let’s make coding as fun as playing.</p>",
