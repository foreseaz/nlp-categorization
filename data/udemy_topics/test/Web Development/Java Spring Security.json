    "description": "<p>  \tThis course will teach a Java programmer to add robust security to their web applications.  Just like Facebook requires you to login before you can access your profile page, I will teach you how to stop unauthorized users from accessing the protected pages in your Java web application.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>No prior experience with Spring Security is needed.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tI&#039;ll show you exactly how to take your new or existing Java web application and make it so that you can protect certain pages/URLs from unauthorized users.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>What is an unauthorized user?  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \tAnyone who hasn&#039;t yet provided a username and password that matches an entry in your database!  </p>  <p>  \tI even show you how to assign roles to user accounts so you can custom tailor the user experience.  </p>  <p>  \tBasic users, Admin users, Super users, whatever user role you&#039;d like to create, you can weave them into your web application and have it respond in dynamic ways  </p>  <p>  \tYou&#039;ll learn how to integrate Spring Security directly into your existing database and protect whichever pages you like in less than a day.  </p>  <p>  \tPlus I show you exactly how to handle the always pesky &quot;set up&quot; process so it&#039;ll be a pain free experience for you.  </p>",
