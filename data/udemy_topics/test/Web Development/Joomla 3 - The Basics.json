    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t This is the original getting started with Joomla course that has been online since 2008. Now fully updated for Joomla 3, this course has been watched by tens of thousands of students worldwide. But the best part is that all 16 lessons and the 100 page accompanying workbook are <strong style=\"\">free</strong>!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t So if you&#039;re looking how to get started with Joomla 3 quickly and easily, you&#039;re in the right place. Just because it&#039;s free doesn&#039;t mean that you get a cut-down down version of another course. Yes, I do have some advanced courses, but this comprehensive beginner course <strong style=\"\">teaches you all the essential Joomla concepts</strong> so you can get your first website built in record time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t I started building websites in 1995 and when content management systems came along, I hated them. The designs were awful, you were forced to change the way you worked and the documentation was woeful. Even simple things like creating a page made no sense. The problem is that most people try to learn by watching a couple of videos and reading a few tutorials. That&#039;s what I did which only led to frustration.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Learning Joomla is a bit like building a brick wall. Many beginners have a basic foundation - they understand the essentials of websites. Then they start piling on a few bricks here and there. But as their wall of knowledge is constructed, it&#039;s full of holes. Eventually they hit a point where their wall can&#039;t sustain any more weight and it collapses. <strong style=\"\">What a waste of time!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t This course takes a <strong style=\"\">step-by-step</strong> approach to building Joomla websites. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, so <strong style=\"\">your wall is solid</strong>. So whether you&#039;re looking to save money by building your own website, or if you&#039;re an existing web developer needing to learn Joomla, you are in the right place. <strong style=\"\">Join the thousands of students who have taken this course by enrolling today</strong>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Remember that a comprehensive workbook with loads of screenshots is included to save you time. I&#039;m also here to answer any questions you might have as you go along.  </p>",
