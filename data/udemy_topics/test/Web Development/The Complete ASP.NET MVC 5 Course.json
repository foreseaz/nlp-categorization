ASP.NET Core 1.0 is still an immature framework and it's going to take quite some time until it gets adopted for production use. That aside, it is not much different from ASP.NET MVC 5. It's designed on the same principles, but provides a few small improvements in different areas. So, the skills you'll learn in this course to build real-world applications will apply to ASP.NET Core 1.0 in the future as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">2- Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?</strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you'll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you'll be confident that you're in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, many of these free tutorials, including tutorials published by Microsoft on the official ASP.NET website, teach you poor practices. Throughout this course, Mosh points out some of these poor practices and explains in technical terms why you should avoid them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">30-DAY FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course comes with a 30-day full money-back guarantee.
