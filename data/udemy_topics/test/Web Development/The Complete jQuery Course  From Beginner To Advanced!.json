Topics included in the course include:<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Effects &amp; Animations:</strong> Make your site come alive with jQuery's animation utilities and enhance your the responsiveness of your design to user behavior and input. Beautify your site with elegant animations, e.g. fading in elements, sliding in submenus and highlighting selected elements.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">DOM Manipulation:</strong> Change the contents and appearance of any element in the DOM, even dynamically added ones. Select any element with ease and modify its CSS styles, positioning, content text, image src, or whatever you can think of.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Learn AJAX:</strong> Discover how to fetch and add content to your page dynamically without reloading. Fetch images from Flickr, movies from TheMovieDB and display all using jQuery's user-friendly syntax.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Event Handling:</strong> Learn how to handle any user input events, including mouse clicks and keyboard input. Use keyboard input to create a simple game with a main player moving around using the arrow keys.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Form Validation:</strong> Create a fast-feedback form that notifies your users of incorrectly formatted input before even submitting the form. Additionally, perform basic validation checking with jQuery before sending the form data to the server.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the course, you'll not only have life-long access to all the lectures but also to us. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">We'</strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">ll be there to personally answer all your questions</strong> and help you get the most out of this course. Also, you can always let us know any suggestions and wishes you have to improve the course. Additionally, we'll include <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">all the resources you need</strong> to fully follow along, including the project code, configurations, presentation slides etc.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The ideal student for this course <strong>should have a </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">basic understanding of HTML &amp; CSS</strong>, though we'll briefly recap CSS selectors (which are really important in jQuery). A basic understanding of JavaScript or another programming language is beneficial but not required, we'll briefly talk about JavaScript and other JavaScript frameworks before finally diving into jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course is structured in a way that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you will get hands-on experience as fast as possible</strong>. Still, we'll be covering some general concepts about JavaScript, jQuery and other frameworks as well. However, we want you to get your hands dirty -- because the only way to actually learn a programming language (or a framework) is to really get into the code yourself!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">You should definitely take this course if you can identify with one of the following:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I know HTML &amp; CSS and want to expand my knowledge to work as a web developer.</li><li>I'm a web developer with knowledge about JavaScript and want to learn jQuery to speed up my development and introduce fewer bugs.</li><li>I'm a student interested in web design &amp; web development and want to learn to create awesome &amp; beautiful sites in less time</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There may be many more reasons to take this course. In any case, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">jQuery will increase your productivity with JavaScript significantly</strong> and enable you to create more sophisticated functionality with minimum work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>__________________________________________________________________________</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With the right mindset, understanding, and application of the teachings in this course, you will instantly begin to move towards mastering jQuery in no time! <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When we learn something new,</strong> I add it to the course - at no additional cost to you!
