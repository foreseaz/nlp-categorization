    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">So you want to learn how to create websites or you just want to learn html and css.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t              Maybe you&#039;ve already tried going through some tutorials online but you&#039;re left more confused than when you started because of all the technical stuff...  </p>  <p>  \t              ...and what&#039;s worse, when you&#039;d try and get stuck, you&#039;d spend hours on forums trying to find out what went wrong.  </p>  <p>  \t              Well, I was in the same situation. My name is James and I&#039;m one of the instructors at TechLemur.  </p>  <p>  \t              When I was first trying to learn html and css, I spent hours trying to follow along to tutorials but I&#039;d always get stuck and run into problems.  </p>  <p>  \t              Because there was no one to help me, I&#039;d have to spend more time, on my own, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong.  </p>  <p>  \t              After a lot of hours, headache and frustration, I finally began building webpages using html and css. Now, years later, I&#039;m doing great.  </p>  <p>  \t              But here&#039;s the thing...  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>when I was learning html and css for the first time... I wish there was a course or a teacher that could have made it easier for me to learn both html/css and saved me all that wasted time trying to figure it out on my own!  </p>  <p>  \t              Even now, I still see other people struggling with the same stuff I struggled with...trying to learn html and css, on their own, from the beginning….  </p>  <p>  \t              So here&#039;s what I did.  </p>  <p>  \t              I took all my knowledge of HTML and CSS and created an easy to follow, step-by-step video course that takes you from knowing nothing about html or css to creating your first webpage from scratch.  </p>  <p>  \t              This crash course was designed so that you&#039;ll learn the absolute fundamentals of html and css to give you a jumpstart and save you hours of frustration and headache.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Here&#039;s what you&#039;ll learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">What html and css are and what they have to do with websites</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to create html documents</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">What HTML elements are and how they work</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to use CSS to create beautiful webpages</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">The three cascading ways of CSS</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Internal vs External style sheets</strong></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t              And much, MUCH more….  </p>  <p>  \t              PLUS the course is project-based which means you&#039;ll create a webpage as you&#039;re guided step-by-step through the course, with lots of exercises.  </p>  <p>  \t              This means you&#039;ll not only be applying what you learn immediately, you&#039;ll also see how html and css are used in the &#039;real world&#039;.  </p>  <p>  \t              AND I’ll be personally guiding and coaching you through the course, so if you have any questions you can easily ask me.  </p>  <p>  \t              AND what&#039;s more… you get a 30 day money back guarantee.
