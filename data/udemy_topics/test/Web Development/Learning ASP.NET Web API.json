    "description": "<p>Revolutionary changes in the mobile world introduced \nvarious type of devices such as smart phones, tablets, and IoT devices, \nall connected to a network based on a HTTP protocol and HTML 5. This \nlead to a big push to build REST-based services that expose data over \nHTTP with content negotiation techniques that can be seamlessly consumed\n by various devices with different platforms. ASP.NET Web API is the \nprimary framework for .NET developers to build REST-based services using\n the latest standards and serve the growing need to expose data.</p>\n\n<p>This course takes you on a journey right from the basics and explains\n the building blocks of Web API through an example application. Starting\n off with the basics, we discuss REST Constraints when designing an API \nwith a change in the ASP.NET Core framework. Then we explore building \nblocks such as Routing, URI Controllers, HTTP verbs, and implement REST \nthrough examples.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As we move on, we’ll delve into some advanced key topics such as \ndependency injection, versioning, caching, and more to build a modular, \ntestable and maintainable application. Then we consume the complete API \nusing an MVC client and provide a quick overview of AngularJS Client.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we develop a Restful API using ASP.Net Core API. We wrap up \nwith a few handy tips and best practices to make robust and scalable \nAPIs. By the end of this course, you will have a thorough knowledge of \nWeb API services and advanced features so you can easily get started.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About The Author</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brij Bhushan Mishra</strong> is a 5 times Microsoft MVP, Author, blogger, speaker and .NET geek.
