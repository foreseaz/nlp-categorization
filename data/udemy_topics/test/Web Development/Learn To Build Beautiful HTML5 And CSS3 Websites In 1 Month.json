They’re looking for designers that can make their designs come to life on a webpage through HTML and CSS. Don’t take our word for it? Listen to our students:  </p>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">Around two months ago I graduated from the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam as a User Experience Designer. Pretty awesome but soon I discovered there was not a lot of work in this area of expertise. So to enhance my chances for a suitable job I decided to improve my front-end skills. Every company wants people with programming skills nowadays. Since I advertised that in my motivational letters and mentioning it in my CV I have multiple invitation from companies to get to know each other.&quot;</em> -- Ruud Visser, Graduate from University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam  </p>  <h4>Coders that want to learn HTML and CSS fast</h4>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">Excellent course that exposed me step-by-step to the world of web design. I come from a computer programming background and never really had to build a site from scratch. This was a great tool in pushing me to be a more well-rounded tech person.</em> - Khalid  </p>  <h4>Complete beginners</h4>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Absolutely awesome!</strong> <em style=\"\">I recommend this course to anyone who feels like learning to code is too hard to start off with, because it really isn&#039;t. I thought it was too hard, but Ryan makes it look really easy with his step for step increase in difficulty. I built my own website within a week after starting this course, and it looks really great. Keep it up, Ryan!</em> -- Robert de Kok  </p>  <h4>Those that have tried to learn HTML and CSS before and stopped</h4>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">This is the first time I was able to go from start to finish with making an entire site. I have done other training before but they don&#039;t ever seem to close it off at the end. This class went over everything needed to make a site. I would love to find other courses like this. I also did not feel dumb mid way through the course due to lack of explaining. Everything was well documented and covered. Very good job on this thanks.</em> - Jay Mims  </p>  <h4>Hustlers who want promotions</h4>  <p>  \t<em style=\"\">Man, I would have to say this is hands down the best course ever! I&#039;ve done a ton of certifications, training, and real-world experience in other areas of IT. Nothing I&#039;ve done so far has been as rewarding and I felt like making something and actually have the necessary skills to do so, without looking elsewhere. Thanks for this, I am at a loss for words; I hope this helped articulate how thankful I am.
