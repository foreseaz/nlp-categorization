    "description": "<p>Why enroll in this course? Perhaps you have programmed a little. But writing small code samples ultimately leads to limited skills. Creating an application requires the synthesis of many different skills. In this course, you learn how to build a complete, but still understandable, application using Microsoft C#, Visual Studio 2015, and Yahoo.  This application has an interface with numerous parts, consists of two forms, and can download stock information from Yahoo. This course, in other words, is for those who want to grow their skills. This course consists of HD video lessons, downloadable zip files of all the project files, and cloneable GitHub files. These are included so you can check your work against ours at each stage of the project. Assuming you complete the course, you'll be done in only two and a half hours, so you'll learn a lot within a relatively short period of time. Let's get coding!</p>",
