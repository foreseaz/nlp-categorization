    "description": "<p>  \tIn &quot;HTML5 Animation and Transition&quot;, you&#039;ll be learning how to develop rich, complex motion graphics using HTML5 APIs such as DOM, CSS3, Canvas, SVG, and WebGL, as well as the basic mathematical concepts behind complex animations—essential knowledge for any modern web developer.  </p>  <p>  \tIn the &quot;HTML5 Animation and Transition&quot; video course, we will tackle everything that you need to know in order to become an expert at animating elements using the latest HTML5 APIs, starting from the most rudimentary methods such as using the DOM, to the most modern ones such as SVG, CSS3, Canvas, and WebGL. At the same time, you&#039;ll also be learning the mathematical concepts required to make complex animations.  </p>  <p>  \tUsing the first chapters, you will learn (or refresh!) concepts such as vectors, vector operations, interpolations, and easing and acceleration. Then, you&#039;ll learn how to display static graphics on the screen using several rendering methods available in HTML5, such as DOM, CSS3, SVG, Canvas, or WebGL. Once you&#039;ve learned how to display things on the screen, you&#039;ll dedicate entire chapters to implement several animation examples using every single rendering method.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<span><strong style=\"\">Mario Andrés Pagella</strong> is the author of &quot;Making Isometric Social RealTime Games with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, O&#039;Reilly Media&quot;.
