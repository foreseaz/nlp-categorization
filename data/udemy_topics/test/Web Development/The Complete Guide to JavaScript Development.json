Essentially we'll cover 99% of the topics related to JavaSript.</strong></em></p><p>Each lecture contains code examples and explanation of the topic from a senior front end developer's perspective who has 11 years of programming experience.</p><p><strong><em>During the course you guys will be implementing the real world projects. No, it's not about some simple and useless projects:)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>We'll code really useful and powerful projects with you.</em></strong></p><p>One of the projects we'll code together will get all the data from a user Instagram accounts via Instagram's API and display them on the page in a different ways. This project is splitted to 22 lessons.
