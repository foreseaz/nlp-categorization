    "description": "<p>The Scala programming language has gained a lot of traction in the \nlast couple of years because of its functional orientation and \nconciseness. The industry has a strong interest in using Scala in modern\n production systems, and as such, the Spray framework and Akka toolkit \nbecame a natural choice for back-end Scala developers building \nhighly-scalable, reliable, reactive REST(ful) web services and APIs.</p>\n\n<p>This video course will be an exciting journey into the universe of \nthe web development using the Scala programming language and frameworks.\n It is a starting point from which you'll learn the basics of building \nREST(ful) web services and APIs using the non-blocking and asynchronous \nprogramming models that lie in the heart of the Spray framework. You’ll \nstart off by learning about the REST architecture. After that, you will \nswitch gears to the Akka toolkit and Spray framework, building the \nsample book catalog application along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you've learned about the REST architectural style and Actor \nModel, the foundations that the Spray framework is built upon, you’ll \nshape out your own REST(ful) web services by providing simple route \ndefinitions. Further on, we'll delve into authentication, authorization,\n secure transport, documentation, test cases, and caching support. \nFinally, you will learn how to develop the Spray client API.</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About The Author</strong></p><p><strong>Andriy Redko</strong> is a seasoned software developer and blogger, and is very <br>passionate about technology and software development in general.</p>",
