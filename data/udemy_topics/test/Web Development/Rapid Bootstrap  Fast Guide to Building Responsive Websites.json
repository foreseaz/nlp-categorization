    "description": "<p>  \t  In this course we will use the Twitter Bootstrap framework and demonstrate how you can rapidly create dynamic blog layouts and develop websites using modern web tools and techniques such as CSS preprocessors, web fonts, JavaScript, and more.  </p>  <p>  \t  We will start with an introduction to Bootstrap and quickly move on to building the GRID layout. Here we will set up the Typeography and add Navigation to our layout.  </p>  <p>  \t   Once we are done with the basic architecture we will add styles and take advantage of the Bootstrap Media elements to give a unique look to our website. As soon as our website is up and running, we will wrap up with a glimpse into the next steps you can take to move on to the next level with this project.  </p>  <p>  \t       Once you complete this course you will be able to effectively use Bootstrap and create unique and responsive websites, all in just 45 minutes.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Brock Nunn</strong> is a frontend web developer from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
