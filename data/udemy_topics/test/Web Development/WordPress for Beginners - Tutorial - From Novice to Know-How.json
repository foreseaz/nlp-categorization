    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is a relaxed version of how to install a WordPress website and work with it.  I skip the formalities and teach in the only way I know how - as myself.  It's how I would have wanted to be taught, if I didn't have to teach myself everything in the first place and waste countless hours trial-and-error'ing my way through this web world we have all come to know and love!</p><p style=\"\">The course starts with the basics: how to choose a web host (GoDaddy is used in this series), how to download a couple necessary programs like Atom (code editor) and FileZilla, and also how to download the free WordPress core files and upload those bad boys using FTP to your own web server (you know, that thing you purchased from GoDaddy / Bluehost / Hostgator / etc...)</p><p style=\"\">As the course progresses you will learn how to install WordPress (the hard way - self-hosted).  This will be the most challenging part of the entire course, but don't be afraid, you can do it, and I will help!</p><p style=\"\">Once the installation of WordPress is complete, I will walk you through every piece of the WordPress backend, detailing (to the best of 'my' ability) what every piece does and is used for.  You will learn how to create posts, pages, manage users, categories, tags, upload photos, work with menus, plugins, themes, and a lot more.</p><p style=\"\">The people that should take this course are those that wish to learn how to install WordPress on their own and want a better understanding of how the heck everything works back there.  It really is a lot of fun to use once you learn all of these basics.  I hope to see you inside!</p><p style=\"\">- David.</p>",
