This is a powerful integrated development environment designed especially for developing Java applications.  </p>  <p>  \t                 2) This course uses a feature of NetBeans called \"Step Into\". This is by far the best way to truly learn programming because it allows you to observe code execution line to line.  I promise you'll understand Java, and many generic programming concepts, as NEVER before.  </p>  <p>  \t                 3) You get 8+ hours of content, and about 140 quiz questions  </p>  <p>  \t                 4) The course is taught in a way very similar to the popular Microsoft C# course with Visual Studio 2013. That course has 1000+ students already enrolled.  </p>  <p>  \t                 5) Many of the concepts covered in this course exist in other languages, such as JavaScript and C#, so you're learning something general that can be easily transferred to other languages.  </p>  <p>  \t                 6) Java is a popular language with many jobs in the marketplace. These are usually jobs that pay very well.  </p>  <p>  \t              7) There is a color image of the code to accompany each lesson.  </p>  <p>  \t             8) Given the amount of content, number of quizzes, and color images to help you learn, this is BY FAR the best deal on this site. Join today.  </p>",
