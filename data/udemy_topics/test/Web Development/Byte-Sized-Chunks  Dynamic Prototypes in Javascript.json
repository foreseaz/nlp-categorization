    "description": "<p><strong>Note: This course is a subset of our much longer course 'Learn By Example: HTML, CSS and Javascript' so please don't sign up for both:-)</strong><br></p><p>Javascript objects, prototypes and JSON - that's what this course is about.</p><p>This is <strong>not</strong> a course on Javascript frameworks - its about <strong>solid, fundamental Javascript</strong>. You'll be surprised by how much more you can get done on your web pages once you learn these technologies <strong>the right way</strong>.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What do we mean by that?</strong></p><ul><li>Relatively <strong>few folks formally learn HTML, CSS or Javascript</strong>, because its quite easy to get stuff done in these technologies in a \"quick-and-dirty way\".</li></ul><ul><li>That \"quick-and-dirty\" way of learning and doing leads to problems over time, because <strong>Javascript and CSS are actually quite complex</strong>, so it is easy to do things the wrong way</li></ul><ul><li>This course will help, because it is entirely built atop examples. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a simple, specific use-case. <strong>Each example is simple, but not simplistic.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>What's Included:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prototypes</strong> are Javascript's way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>JSON</strong> is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why - because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in Javascript</li></ul><ul><li><strong>The Document-Object-Model</strong> is what ties Javascript back to HTML and CSS. Together with JSON, the DOM ties it all together from server to skin.</li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything - <strong>anything!</strong> - and we will always reply :-)</li></ul>",
