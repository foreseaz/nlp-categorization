This great speed makes it the perfect candidate for implementing a RESTful API in it, and the best, it is completely easy!</p> <p> Millions of programmers of <em>PHP </em> use <em>L</em><em>aravel </em> and all of them are agree with the incredible ease and agility that <em> Lumen </em> provides for micro services, including of course, <em>RESTful APIs, </em>so, <strong>what are you waiting for? Take it now!</strong></p> <p>Lumen for PHP have been included new concepts and facilities, similar to Laravel allowing you to create fast, agile but powerful RESTful API easily.</p><p>You are going to obtain this specific knoledge and skills during the course:</p> <ul><li>Major differences and facilities of Lumen VS Laravel</li><li>Creating a development environment with <strong>Homestead</strong></li><li>Interaction with <strong>Vagrant virtual machines</strong></li><li>Configure Homestead with Vagrant virtual sites</li><li>Configure and use the code editor <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong></li><li>Using <strong>PHP artisan</strong> for creating code</li><li>Global <strong>Middlewares </strong>and route middleware</li><li>Create models</li><li>Relationships <strong>one to many</strong> between models (1: N)</li><li>Relationships <strong>many to many</strong> between models (N: N)</li><li>Tables intermediary or <strong>pivot</strong></li><li>Validation of requests</li><li>Management and <strong>control of exceptions</strong> and errors</li><li><strong>Migrations </strong>(automatic creation of databases)</li><li><strong>Seeds </strong>(Automatic Insertion databases)</li><li><strong>Factories </strong>, to create test/fake data</li><li>Creating a server <strong>OAuth 2</strong></li><li>Generate <strong>access_token</strong></li><li><strong>Resource protection</strong> with access token</li><li>Restrict access through access token</li><li>Improving framework for <strong>production</strong></li><li>Interaction with the database through <strong>Eloquent</strong></li><li>Much, much more.</li></ul> <p> During the course will create a <em> RESTful API from scratch </em>, following the <em> REST </em> architecture and the proper construction of URLs to identify actions and resources using the controllers and routes for resources on Lumen. </p> <p> Hone the characteristics of your work tools (<em> Sublime Text 3, Git shell, Lumen, Composer, artisan PHP </em>) and improve your productivity for development agile. </p> <p>Learn to develop a local project on <strong><em>Windows </em> </strong> with <strong> Homestead </strong>, how to interact with the virtual machine <strong> Vagrant </strong>, with the operative system <strong> Ubuntu </strong> through a connection <strong> ssh </strong>. <em> </em> </p> <p> You'll see how to use <em> Lumen </em>through the console <em> <strong> PHP artisan </strong> </em> to build agile a <em> RESTful API </em> that responds to methods of <em> HTTP </em> (<em> GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE PATCH </em>), also populate the database structure and build an automated manner. </p> <p> <strong> It does not end there! </strong>Will have access for l<em>ife for the </em><em>additional classes </em> that are constantly be adding to the course. </p> <p> Upon completion of this course you will be able to develop your own RESTful API with Lumen and PHP and including micro-services, in a quick and simple way, exploiting the facilities provided by this micro-framework for the proper and adequate implementation of your projects.</p> <p> <strong> Do not wait </strong> to be proficient in PHP and RESTful. Join the course and see you in class </p>",
