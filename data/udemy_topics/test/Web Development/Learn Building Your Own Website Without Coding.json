    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Do you really need a website?</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Of course you do! But you already know that. Otherwise you would not be here. So I won’t waste your time with all the statistics and facts why you need a website, while every child nowadays knows that when he is looking for something he is going to look it up online.  </p>  <p>  \t   But guess what? Without a website you are not going to be found; ergo you don’t exist!  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">No, the real question is how to get a website!</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  And in my opinion paying a web-designer thousands of dollars for a website is like hiring Picasso to design a business letter when MS Word can easily do the job for you.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course I will show you the best and more important free website builder out there, so you don’t have to waste your time, money and frustration with useless software. You will be able to choose one of the hundred beautiful and professional designs already made for you. With one click half of the work is already done. We then just need to drag and drop in some elements, like text and images and customize the look to our needs, by filling in some numbers in the matching fields. It really is as easy as that.  </p>  <p>  \t  But on top of all, I will save you a lot of time by signing up for the wrong software or trying to figure out where all the fields are and what sliders do what. Instead I will build a website with you, all common pages and even advanced and industry specific ones and show you what to do in order to get the result you want.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Course Objectives:</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course I will teach you:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Step by step how to build your website from scratch without the need to code</li>  \t<li>To understand the general layout of every website</li>  \t<li>How to structure your website, so your clients will find it easy to navigate</li>  \t<li>How to add and edit text and images</li>  \t<li>How to add links</li>  \t<li>How to add videos</li>  \t<li>How to add music</li>  \t<li>How to add an image gallery</li>  \t<li>How to add and edit different kind of image sliders (including very cools ones, you would otherwise pay extra to include in your website)</li>  \t<li>How to add Social Share Buttons, like Twitter and Facebook</li>  \t<li>How to add a contact form and Google Maps</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  …and much more!  </p>",
