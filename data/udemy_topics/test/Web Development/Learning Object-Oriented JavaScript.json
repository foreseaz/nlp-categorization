    "description": "<p>  \tThis course will help you change some common coding practices and empower you by giving you the tools you need for more efficient development.  </p>  <p>  \tYou start with building a simple digital clock and use this as the case sample for the course. Then, we begin exploring the object-oriented tools in JavaScript such as the constructor, scope, methods, and properties. Next, we dive even deeper as we explore the wonderful world of prototypes, static methods and properties, and namespaces. We then turn our attention to inheritance and finally end the course with a section to dedicated events and callbacks. As we explore what they are and how to use them, we complete our sample by creating a fully usable alarm clock.  </p>  <p>  \tWith this course, you will be an expert in OOP with JavaScript in under 3 hours!  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">        Ben Fhala </strong>discovered his passion for data visualization six years ago while he was working at Parsons in New York, in their data visualization department, PIIM.
