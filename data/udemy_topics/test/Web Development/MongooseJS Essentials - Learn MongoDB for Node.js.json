    "description": "<p>In this course we will build a simple application to show how to perform full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations within Node.js.  </p><p>We'll be using the Node module MongooseJS. Mongoose allows us to define our models in the form of a schema, along with a simple to use API that abstracts away a lot of the pain of working directly with the MongoDB driver.</p><p>First, we will create a Book schema using MongooseJS. We will use string data types to add a title, author and description. Next, we will build a simple server using Express.js.  Then we will build 4 routes to query, update and delete Books from our Schema.  We will use Postman to perform actions on these routes and check the results in our browser.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What You Will Learn</strong></p><ul><li>Build CRUD Applications</li><li>Create Mongoose Schemas</li><li>Design Routes using Express.js</li><li>Create a Server using Express.js</li><li>Build a RESTful API</li></ul>",
