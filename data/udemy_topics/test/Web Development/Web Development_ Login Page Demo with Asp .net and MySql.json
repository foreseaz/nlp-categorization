I recommend only those students to take this course who have a little bit knowledge about asp .net and mysql. However, don&#039;t worry, you can always enroll in the other courses I have offered on udemy to get started. </p><p style=\"\">This is how we move through the course: </p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">1.
