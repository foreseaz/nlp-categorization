Though it is a subset of JavaScript, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">JSON is language-independent</strong>. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Most of the popular programming languages</strong> including PHP, Ruby, C#, Python etc.<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> support JSON making it the widely used data interchange format</strong>.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oliver says </p><p>\"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Excellent Course</strong>. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">I am learning easily all the concepts. Instructor explain with real examples.</strong> I have the feeling to be working online with the instructor. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Very well explained.</strong>\"</p><p>Rayvn Manuel says</p><p>\"The repetition in the explanation really helps to remember and recall the information. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The approach to the topics is gradual; meaning, starting from the basics and slowly introducing more. </strong>And<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> I appreciate the comparison of technologies since its really helpful to understand why use one technology over another</strong>.\"</p><p>Ido Yogev says</p><p>\"<strong>Very nice course, straight to the point. Topics are illustrated simple and professional form. Warmly recommended</strong> !!!\"</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>\"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">JSON in Action: Build JSON-Based Applications\" is a 100% hands-on JSON (<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">JavaScript Object Notation</strong>) course</strong>. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">By the end of this course, you will not only understand what JSON is, but also learn how to develop applications making use of real-world APIs that return JSON data</strong>. Just learning JSON syntax is not going to help you in anyways. You should be able to use JSON in the development process. Though AJAX and APIs do not come under the scope of this course, here <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">we discuss how to use AJAX to contact APIs and then to collect the JSON result returned by APIs</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is structured as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first section, you will understand <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">what JSON is, compare JSON and XML </strong>and also learn<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> why JSON is not JavaScript Object</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second section, you will understand JSON in more detail. You will learn <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">JSON syntax rules</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">different data types (number, string, boolean, null, array and object) </strong>you can use in JSON data. You will also practise to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">identify different data types in real world JSON data </strong>and also to<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> write JSON data on your own</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, you will understand how easy it is to use JSON with JavaScript. You will learn how to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">use JSON.parse and JSON.stringify methods</strong> to convert JSON data to JavaScript objects and JavaScript objects to JSON strings respectively. You will also learn how to get the required information from the available JSON data. You will understand the difference between <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">dot notation and bracket notation</strong>. You will also learn how to use <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">XMLHttpRequest object </strong>to fetch the .json file from a server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth section explains <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">how to use AJAX techniques to contact an API</strong> and to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">collect the JSON output returned by the API</strong>. You will learn how to contact the API using GET or POST methods and also making a synchronous or asynchronous requests. You will also see how you can pass JSON as the input to an API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section, we discuss how to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">use JSON with PHP</strong>. This lecture explains <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">json_encode and json_decode </strong>methods. This section will be updated to teach you how to use JSON with other programming languages as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last section is the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Let's Develop</strong> section where you are going to apply your JSON knowledge to develop some applications on your own. Now there are two applications in this section.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Currency Converter</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">BMI Calculator</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The first application \"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Currency Converter\" </strong>application contacts a real-world API, collects the JSON data, and performs currency conversion. The second application \"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">BMI Calculator</strong>\" is a more detailed one. As part of this application, you will be developing a simple API using PHP. You will contact that API (which you designed on your own), collect the JSON response and then process it to get the result you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Join this 100% practical JSON course</strong> and start developing API-based applications on your own applying JSON knowledge.</p>",
