Discover the power of CSS3&#039;s media queries to target various devices and resolutions, including mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers. Learn how to extract Photoshop content for use in your designs, insert it with modern HTML5, and control it with a variety of CSS3 techniques. By the end of this VTC course, you&#039;ll have three beautiful designs, each one displaying automatically depending on the device being used to view it. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>  <p>  \tWork files for this course can be downloaded from the first lecture.  </p>",
