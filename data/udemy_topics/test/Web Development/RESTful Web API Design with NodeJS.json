    "description": "<p>RESTful Web APIs allow developers to create unprecedented \napplications by leveraging the data on the Internet. Since JavaScript is\n the language of the web, building APIs using Node.js provides a \nseamless development experience on both the front end and the back end.</p>\n\n<p>This video course gives you an overview of a RESTful API and goes \nthrough the logical steps of building one. It explores three different \nAPIs, focusing on their similarities and differences to effectively \nimplement one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start off by defining APIs, showing how they can be built on \ntop of HTTP, and listing the properties that make an API RESTful. We \nwill develop Twitter Notes, a web application that lets its users leave \nnotes for their Twitter friends. We will use Twitter’s API to implement a\n login flow and then design a web API. In addition to using Twitter’s \nAPI, we will take a closer look at two other real-world APIs—Facebook \nAPI and GitHub API. Finally, we’ll end up honing some best practices to \nkeep the APIs secure, maintainable, and performant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have a good grasp of APIs, HTTP, \nREST, OAuth 1.0a, API testing, and API security. Since the course \nexplores three different REST APIs, you will reach a level where you \nwill be comfortable using any RESTful API, even if it does not have an \nSDK.</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About The Author</strong><br></p><p><strong>Saleh Hamadeh </strong>started programming when he was 13, and he currently studies computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
