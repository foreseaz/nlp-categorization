But I couldn't because It's not easy to build this e-commerce platform. However through this course, I found easy and simple starting point. Though It will be needed to buy license and takes time to build a site. I'm sure this course will give you great opportunities to start your own business. Thank you Sean...\"</em></p><p><strong>The One thing I wanted to give you is a laymen's type course</strong>; a course that you can follow step by step; a course that  at the beginning you have the same starting point of nothing and at the end you have a functioning ecommerce website - something you just need to add products and images to. This is the idea of what this course is; and what it gives you.</p><p>It doesn't take time, its not difficult and it certainly isn't expensive. You don't even need stock as you can create an affiliate store..</p><p>So, I decided to take all the know how I had and played around until I found out you could create a eCommerce Website in less than 1 hour. Yes! Less that 1 hour and I wrote it down and created this course so that you could create your online shop in less than 1 hour .</p><p>In this course your going to learn :</p><ul><li>How to start from nothing and finish with a working ecommerce website</li><li>How to use Wordpress, Ultimatum and WooCommerce and create your own online shop</li><li>Learn how to create your own theme and not change someone else</li><li>You'll learn how to add products, create coupons, setup postage costs, etc</li><li>Learn how you can be using a webpage to sell affiliate products</li><li>... and much more</li></ul><p>One more thing I wanted to do with this course.. Many many many Wordpress and WooCommerce sites out there use the odd free theme or some particular premium themes. What I didn't want to do was create another course where you use that theme and your shop looks like everyone else shop that uses that theme .</p><p>Using Ultimatum you start from a blank slate and your create Your Theme and Your Shops Look. You eCommerce site won't look like everyone else, won't get lost in the clutter and will be unique .</p><p>So, <strong>do you want to have your own ecommerce site</strong>. <strong>Do you want to have your own theme on that site</strong>? Then why not take a look at this course today and be selling .. well today..</p><p><strong>9th March 2015</strong> - I've been adding new content to shows you how to use more of the functionality in WooCommerce and also enhance your store to make it the best store it can be</p><p><strong>11th March 2015</strong> - I've just started a new section on best practices for your shop. The first video I have added is about social media sharing of your shop products and how this is vital to move your shop forward</p><p><strong>15th March 2015</strong> - Stock management in WooCommerce is a great thing; i've just uploaded a new lecture showing how you do this; and exactly how easy it is</p>",
