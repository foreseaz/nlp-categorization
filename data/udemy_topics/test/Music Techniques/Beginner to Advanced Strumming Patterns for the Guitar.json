Also learn more then just the standard ways to play guitar chords.  The videos are all straight to the point and clearly broke down for you.  THERE IS NO EXTRA TALKING on the videos.  I have been fortunate to have taught over 3000 students now and have a very good understanding of how to teach so a student gets player the guitar faster.  Hopefully you will enjoy this course and have fun learning new musical ideas that you can apply to your guitar. </p><p> Thanks and good luck! Chuck Millar</p>",
