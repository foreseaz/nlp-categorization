    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   Painless Piano Patriotic Song Pack has 6 cool and fun arrangements of favorite American anthems: American the Beautiful (Elementary and Intermediate), The Stars and Stripes Forever March (Elementary and Intermediate) and of course the Star-Spangled Banner (Elementary and Intermediate). With Independence just around the corner, what better time to learn the stirring compositions that have served as our the soundtrack to the American national experience?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            I had physical learning challenges as a child and one teacher  told me I could not learn. But I loved it too much- and with the help of  my magical mentor, I learned how to overcome, solve, figure out, and  surpass my challenges. I can help you solve your musical challenges and  any that come along down the road. We can do this together- and  ultimately, you will do it yourself!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Materials incl?  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">          There are videos, PFD&#039;s of Theory, Technique samples and the song arrangements. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">The arrangements are broken down into easily mastered phrases, both hands alone, and hands together. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">PDF&#039;s are provided for hands alone study, hands together, and also unmarked scores.  </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Glossary and Note Chart</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How to Use This Course PDF which is kind of the Mother Ship,  tying all the pieces together.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Please stay in touch with me or ask questions in the discussion area. Send me a video- I will try to watch it if I am able. I am quite happy, if it is possible, to help you resolve your challenges and plan your performance.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            How long will the course take to complete?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The Theory, Technique and Elementary arrangements should take about 5 to 6 hours, with the Intermediate track perhaps 6 to 8 hours. I believe the elementary pieces can be learned in a couple of hours each. Some people will find some pieces easier, some will find others a bit more challenging.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  How is the course structured?  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Very easy, logical structure helps you not only progress, but revisit and review previous lectures. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">First is the Greetings video, and the intro materials: Glossary, Note Chart (both of these are reference only, it is not required to complete them for the course), and How to Use This Course, which ties all the pieces together and gives helpful tips. If you spend a few minutes reading that doc, your progress will be 30 to 40% faster. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Then Theory video and PDF lay the concept and symbol foundation. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">There is an Elementary Technique video, and 3 PDF&#039;s, one for each Elementary arrangement.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">And there is an Intermediate Technique video with 3 PDF&#039;s, one for each Intermediate arrangement </li>  \t<li style=\"\">There are 6 arrangements (3 songs, each with Elementary and Intermediate level versions). </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Each arrangement has a PDF breaking the score down by easily played and understood phrases, hands alone and also together. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">And an unmarked score PDF for each arrangement gives you a blank canvas to write your musical ideas. </li>  </ul>",
