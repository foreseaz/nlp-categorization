    "description": "<p>\r\n\t       IBM SPSS Modeler is a data mining workbench that allows you to  build predictive models quickly and intuitively without programming.  Analysts typically use SPSS Modeler to analyze data by mining historical  data and then deploying models to generate predictions for recent (or  even real-time) data.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t <strong>Overview:</strong> Modeler&#039;s New R Nodes is a  series of  self-paced videos. This course is divided into four parts:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t ·What are the new Modeler R Nodes and why are they an exciting addition?\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t ·What is R and what are some of the best ways to learn more about it?\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t ·Adding new graphics capability with R\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t ·Adding new statistics capability with R\r\n\t</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t We discuss one of the exiting new features of Modeler 16. We show some R functionality in the R environment itself, but the seminar will culminate in the demonstration of R capabilites in a Modeler stream. Advice will be given on how best to develop more skills in this area, but you will have some working knowledge from these videos alone.\r\n</p>",
