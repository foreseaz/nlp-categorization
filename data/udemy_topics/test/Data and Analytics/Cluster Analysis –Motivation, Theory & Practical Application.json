The idea behind cluster analysis is to find natural groups within data in such a way that each element in the group is as similar to each other as possible. At the same time, the groups are as dissimilar to other groups as possible.</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Course materials</strong>- The course contains video presentations (power point presentations with voice), pdf, excel work book and sas codes.</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Course duration</strong>- The course should take roughly 7 hours to understand and internalize the concepts.</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Course Structure (contents) </strong>The structure of the course is as follows.</li>  </ol>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Motivation</strong> &ndash;  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Where one applies cluster analysis.
