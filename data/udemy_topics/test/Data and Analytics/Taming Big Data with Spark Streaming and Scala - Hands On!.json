    "description": "<p>\"Big Data\" analysis is a hot and highly valuable skill. Thing is, \"big data\" never stops flowing! <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Spark Streaming</strong> is a new and quickly developing technology for processing massive data sets <em>as they are created</em> - why wait for some nightly analysis to run when you can constantly update your analysis in real time, all the time? Whether it's clickstream data from a big website, sensor data from a massive \"Internet of Things\" deployment, financial data, or something else - Spark Streaming is a powerful technology for transforming and analyzing that data right when it is created, all the time.</p>\n\n<p>This course gets your hands on to some real live Twitter data, simulated streams of Apache access logs, and even data used to train machine learning models! You'll write and run real Spark Streaming jobs right at home on your own PC, and toward the end of the course, we'll show you how to take those jobs to a real Hadoop cluster and run them in a production environment too.</p>\n\n<p>Across <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">over 30 lectures</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">almost 6 hours</strong> of video content, you'll:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Get a crash course in the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Scala </strong>programming language</li><li>Learn how Apache Spark operates on a cluster</li><li>Set up discretized streams with Spark Streaming and transform them as data is received</li><li>Analyze streaming data over <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">sliding windows</strong> of time</li><li>Maintain <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">stateful information</strong> across streams of data</li><li>Connect Spark Streaming with highly scalable sources of data, including <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Kafka</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Flume</strong>, and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Kinesis</strong></li><li>Dump streams of data in real-time to <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">NoSQL </strong>databases such as <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Cassandra</strong></li><li>Run SQL queries on streamed data in real time</li><li>Train machine learning models in real time with streaming data, and use them to make predictions that keep getting better over time</li><li>Package, deploy, and run self-contained Spark Streaming code to a real <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Hadoop </strong>cluser using Amazon <strong>Elastic MapReduce</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This course is very hands-on, filled with achievable activities and exercises to reinforce your learning. By the end of this course, you'll be confidently creating Spark Streaming scripts in Scala, and be prepared to tackle massive streams of data in a whole new way. You'll be surprised at how easy Spark Streaming makes it!</p>",
