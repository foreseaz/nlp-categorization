They cover every little thing about Google Analytics, every report, every setting and so on, without providing any <strong>ACTIONABLE INFORMATION.</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is different. Just take a look at the lecture titles below. In each lecture, we'll cover specific steps you can take that will help you to ultimately get more traffic and earn more money!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Discover Valuable Insights to Help Grow Your Business</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>✔</strong> Analyse Traffic Sources so You Can Get More Traffic to Your Site</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>✔ Use Behaviour Reports to Improve Visitor Retention &amp; Conversion</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>✔ Find &amp; Resolve Technical Errors Blocking Sales and much much more!<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Once enrolled, you'll also have access to myself, a Google Analytics Certified user, so you can get feedback, advice and support as you complete the lectures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You Don't Need to Be Technical to Take This Course</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the reports that we are going to look at are already contained as standard reports in your Google Analytics Account. To unlock even more insights, you will be setting up a custom report and a custom dashboard but you can set this up in one click - I've made it incredible easy for you!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content &amp; Overview</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed for anyone who wants to make data driven decisions to grow their business but is struggling to do so because they feel overwhelmed by the technicalities and data.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In each section of the course, I'm going to walk you step by step through Google Analytics and show you how to answer strategic questions you may be facing. <br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Strategic Questions You'll Learn How to Answer with Google Analytics:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What Key Performance Indicators should you be tracking?</li><li>Where should you focus your marketing efforts?</li><li>How can you keep more visitors on your site and get them to convert?</li><li>What technical issues are blocking sales?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'll explain how you can answer these keys questions using the analytics of one of my online properties. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can take this same approach with your own data so that you can quickly find and document similar insights and share them with your management team or clients.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, I want to help you identify the \"low hanging fruit\" i.e. the fixes or updates which are easily achievable and will have a disproportionately positive impact on your site.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you're a beginner, intermediate or want a refresh as advanced, this training will help your grow your business (or future business!) with Google Analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I guarantee you the only regret you're going to have is that you didn't find this course 6 months ago and get started then.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stop making important business decisions in the dark.
