    "description": "<p>Perhaps you are just <strong>starting your Business Analyst career</strong> and see BPMN \nin job descriptions and interview questions. Or maybe you are a <strong>seasoned\n practitioner with many years of flowcharting experience</strong>?<br></p>\n\n<p>No matter what is your background you must have heard about the <strong>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) as the new de facto standard for modeling processes. </strong>It can be used when you need to <strong>document your processes as a part of the project </strong>or when you need to<strong> automate your processes.</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong></strong>But if you did not participate in a BPMN course you may still feel a bit intimidated because:\n</p>\n\n<p>a) <strong>BPMN specification has over 500 pages</strong> (half the size of \"Gone with the wind\" and a bit harder to read)\n</p>\n\n<p>b) There are <strong>over 100 various symbols to learn</strong> and at first it is not obvious which are really useful\n</p>\n\n<p>c) There are many resources in the Internet, but they are sometimes contradictory or even wrong\n</p>\n\n<p>Fear not! In this course I will show you what are the <strong>most useful elements of BPMN</strong> you should start with and <strong>how to create easy to understand and maintain process diagrams.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong><br></p><p>The course consists of 6 sections with video lectures, quizzes and mini-projects that will help you start using BPMN in no time. Each mini-project should take you 10-30 minutes to complete, so it will work best if you do one section a day and practice every day.</p>\n\n<p>I know that at first BPMN can be confusing and you may have some questions after you start using it in practice.<br></p>\n\n<p>The course is constantly updated with new content on a basis of your feedback and I will answer all your questions regarding the best ways to use BPMN.<br></p>",
