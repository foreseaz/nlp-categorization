    "description": "<p><strong>What is the aim of this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This course will help you drastically improve your knowledge and skills in business analysis through a series of practical cases. It is designed for people who want to become business analyst or do a lot of business analyses at their work. It is based on my 11 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement and turn-arounds in biggest companies from FMCG, SMG, B2B sector that I worked for.  On the basis of what you will find in this course I have trained over 100 business analysts who now are Investment Directors, Senior Analyst, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members etc.</p>\n\n<p>I teach through cases so most of the lectures will be a case study showing some business problem solved in Excel. To every lecture you will find attached  (in additional resources) the Excel shown the specific business analysis shown in the Lecture. Thanks to this as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made business analyses that can, with certain modification, be applied by you in your work. Every business analysis show in this lecture is easy to edit and adjust to your need.</p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why I decided to create this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The companies I have worked with so far as a Board Member (I am usually, Chief Restructuring Officer VP responsible for Strategy and Development) still have huge problem with proper analyzing intermediate and advance issues – they are usually preoccupied by current activities and have close to no time for  business analysis and strategic decision. Moreover, they do not know how to approach many subject from the analytical point of view to make sure that they are taking the right decision. Therefore, quite often they hire consultants who in turn lack the practical knowledge and experience. This course is my small contribution to improving both consulting as well operational and strategic analyses in FMC, SMCG, B2B companies including also on-line models like e-commerce, SaaS, marketplaces.</p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In what way will you benefit from this course?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course is a practical, step by step guide loaded with tones of analyses, tricks, hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the business analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data. Every business analysis is well described and presented in a form of Excel, attachted to the lecture. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that, thanks to the course, you will know:</p>\n\n<ul><li>How to analyze different aspect of sales, marketing, operations?</li><li>How to draw conclusions from those analyses – both for current operations as well  ase strategic ones?</li><li>How to be efficient in your work as analyst? </li><li>How to build Excels and Power Points so that it is understandable for you and your team, even after some time?</li><li>Chose the right business analysis to identify problems and opportunities</li></ul>\n\n<p>You can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.</p>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How the course is organized?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The course is divided currently in 5 sections and will be adding new section to address other important issues.
