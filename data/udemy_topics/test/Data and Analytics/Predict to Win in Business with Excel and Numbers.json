When you do find time, trying to see what matters in columns and rows packed with too much data but too little meaning bites!  </p>  <p>  \t   Do I have the cure? Not just how to <strong style=\"\">keep</strong> the books, but how to <strong style=\"\">know</strong> their meaning: everything you need to know to know when, whether, and where to act, and predict what will happen in the near future with confidence, so you can anticipate problems before they happen.  </p>  <p>  \t    Starting with an overview of what will be learned, <strong style=\"\">the course includes:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>An <em style=\"\">entertaining</em> Primer on Financial Reports and Accounting Principles, if that is possible...</li>  \t<li>In depth look at the problems of these reports as tools for operating a business  \t<ul style=\"\">  \t\t<li>The Flaw of Averages</li>  \t\t<li>The Foibles of Percentages</li>  \t\t<li>And the Dangers in Limited Comparisons</li>  \t</ul>  \t</li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Then how to create reports that do work</strong>, quickly and easily using the same data, only transforming it visually to allow you to <strong style=\"\">see the real context, what the data means</strong> and <strong style=\"\">what is mostly likely to happen</strong>, so you manage it with your <em style=\"\">eyes on the road in front of you, not stuck in the rear view mirror</em>.</li>  \t<li>Many examples from real people like you.</li>  \t<li>Lots of working together, in virtual real time, like the Khan Academy</li>  \t<li>Independent exercises and study to help you nail how to do them.</li>  \t<li><em style=\"\">AND MORE</em></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t    Based on a proven system with more than <em style=\"\">80 years</em> of successful application in a wide variety of businesses, packed with examples from sports, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and more, and step by step hands on practice, guided by a Master, you will learn to transform data from your existing reports in a few minutes with a flick of a pen or a mouse.  </p>  <p>  \tIf Simon Sinek helps with the why, this course helps with the <em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">how</strong></em>.
