    "description": "<p>  \t  Over the last 13+ years, I have identified a number of steps that elevate the quality of analytic work. When done <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">habit</strong>ually, these steps will <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">professionalize the analysis</strong>, making it more <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">error resistant, flexible and effective</strong> in answering the “question”.</p><p>Most junior analysts have experienced the “oops” moments. My goal is to share with you what I wish someone taught me when I first started working as an analyst.</p>\n\n<p>I have distilled the content into <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">easy to remember</strong> sections to ensure that <strong>you gain a long lasting value</strong> from this course. Each section comes with supplemental material including poster for easy reminder and course reading that for reinforcements.</p>\n\n<p>  \t  Course content:  </p>\n\n<ol>  \t<li>Context</li>  \t<li>Preparations (filing system, inputs, model structure)</li>  \t<li>Building (calculations, testing/checking, documentation)</li>  \t<li>Output (results, presentation, iterations)</li>  </ol>\n\n<p>  \t  Why Habits? Habits drive your life, often subconsciously. Habits are actions that require little effort for you to do and are self-reinforcing.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  Whether you decide to take this course, I’d like you to take away these four tips:  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Take ownership and persevere.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Be self-aware.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Be curious, embrace change and have fun. </strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Make your mistakes fast, and be sure to learn from them.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<u><br>  \t</u>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<u>In Summary</u>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<u>Goal </u>- Help you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">learn </strong>and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">adopt </strong>good habits when doing analytic work.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<u>Format </u>- <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">40 mins of videos </strong>that introduce the principles and illustrate the principles through an example. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Poster and Reading Materials </strong>for each section serves as cheat sheets for future reference and enforcement.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<u>Target Audience </u>- <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Beginner </strong>level analysts or <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Students </strong>who are about to enter the workforce (data, statistical, financial analyses)  </p>\n\n<p>  \t  This course is  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">not </strong>a training program on how to use MS Excel. We use Excel to illustrate the principles.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">not </strong>hours on hours of lectures that are hard to remember. 40 minutes is all you need.  </p>",
