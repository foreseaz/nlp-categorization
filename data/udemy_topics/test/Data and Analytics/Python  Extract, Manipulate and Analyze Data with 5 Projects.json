So here are some projects that we'll work on:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Project</strong>: Data management system using <strong>RDBMS</strong>  <br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Problem statement:</strong> A company <em>XYZ sales</em> deals in solar products and they sell their products all across a country to their customers. So far they have been storing their data in an Excel file. But since their growth has exceeded and in sync with the sales, they need a concrete data management system with an organised data structure</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Project:</strong> Store data from a CSV file to RDBMS.  <br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Problem statement: </strong>Take Yahoo finance data in the CSV format and store the data into an RDBMS.</li><li>·<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Project:</strong> Dealing with Web Data  <br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Problem statement: </strong>Dmoz  is a website, which is an open directory for various websites regarding different categories. We can go to the sports section and get related websites. However, websites keep getting added. So, we need to create a web scraper that automatically fetches all the links in the particular category and stores the data in a CSV format on the file system.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Project:</strong> Data Analysis and Visualization <br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Problem statement:</strong> UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) is an Indian authority responsible for creating biometric data-based identification cards for the Indian citizens. They provide data based on state, gender, and rejection and acceptance of the identification cards in the form of a CSV file. We need to create a helpful visualisation to explore which state, age range, or gender got how much percentage of cards rejected or accepted.</li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Project: </strong>DataNitro  <br><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Problem statement: </strong>Yahoo finance hosts financial data for different companies. We need to implement a solution that can get finance data of different companies and make charts based on the fetched data. We also take you through DataNitro <br>[It lets you run any Python script or library - right in your spreadsheet].
