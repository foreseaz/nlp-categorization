    "description": "<p>White Hat Ethical hacking is testing the IT resources for a good cause and for \nthe betterment of technology. This training will establish your \nunderstanding of all the fundamental concepts, processes, and \nprocedures.. You will spend time concentrating on each knowledge area, \nand studying the tools and techniques, inputs, and outputs associated \nwith each knowledge area.</p><p>This course will cover :-</p><p>foot printing,</p><p>Reconnaissance,</p><p>Scanning,</p><p>System Hacking,</p><p>Password Cracking,</p><p>Trojan and viruses,</p><p>Backdoors,</p><p>Denial of Service attack,</p><p>Web Server Hacking,</p><p>Cryptography,</p><p>Wireless Hacking,</p><p>Session Hijacking etc...........<br></p><p>In \nIntroduction to Ethical Hacking, you will be introduced to various \nconcepts on ethical hacking. You will receive an introduction to the \nbasics of Risk Management and Disaster Recovery. As well as an \nintroduction to Penetration Testing.</p><p>You will gain a comprehensive\n understanding of vulnerability assessment and the tools used in this \nprocess. What kind of security measures do you take to protect your \nfacilities, equipment, resources, personnel, and property from damage \ncaused by unauthorized access? In this course, Physical Security, these \nare questions that we will be answering. Footprinting is the gathering \nof information related to a particular computer and its users and \nsystems.</p><p> Reconnaissance is an exploration that is conducted to \ngain information. Network scanning is the scanning of public or private \nnetworks to find out which systems are running, their IP addresses, and \nwhich services they are running. In Port Scanning, you will learn how \nports can be scanned, how a hacker can break into your network through \nthe ports, and the countermeasures you can take to protect your device \nor network.</p><p> Banner grabbing is a technique used to grab \ninformation about computer systems on a network and the services running\n its open ports. In this course you will be introduced to enumeration \nand the many different uses it has in computer systems. This course will\n include demos on the different tools and uses of enumeration. In this \ncourse you will be learning the fundamentals of Linux. We will be \npairing this course with demos with a more in-depth look into some of \nthe fundamentals and tools of Linux.</p><p> Pentesting is an attack on a\n system in hopes of finding security weaknesses. In the course \nConfiguring Linux for Pentesting, you will be learning the steps to \nconfigure Linux for pentesting and tools used for pentesting on a Linux \nsystem. Whenever we login to a computer system, we provide information \nto identify ourselves. We refer to this as authentication. Ensure that \nyou know everything involved in securing a Windows system against \nattack. During this course you'll get into Windows passwords â€” how \nthey're created, how they're stored, and different methods used to crack\n them.</p><p> You will take a good look at spyware, the activities it \nperforms, different types of spyware, and the countermeasures needed in \norder to prevent hackers from utilizing these types of techniques \nagainst your company. You will also spend time studying different types \nof keyloggers. There are three different types of keyloggers that we see\n used in today's environments: hardware, software, and kernel/driver \nkeyloggers. Covering Tracks will be going over various ways that \nattackers have at their disposal to cover any tracks that may lead to \ntheir unwanted eviction, or worse yet, to an audit trail that would lead\n directly back to them. Trojans and Backdoors is the course where our \nsoftware is going to be going undercover.</p><p>You will discover what \nviruses and worms are and how they can infect computers and systems. \nSniffers is our course where we take a look at Network Sniffing. Social \nengineering is the art of extorting employees for information.</p><p> \nBecome familiar with the following concepts: denial-of-service, \ndistributed denial-of-service, and how the denial-of-service and \ndistributed denial-of-service attacks take place. In the course Session \nHijacking, you will learn details about session hijacking, well-known \ntechniques employed by aggressors, the steps involved in session \nhijacking, various types of session hijacking, tools for hijacking \nsessions, ways you can protect yourselves from session hijacking, and \nhow pentesting can be used to identify vulnerabilities. Hacking Web and \nApplication Servers, is a course that will give you a good idea about \nvulnerabilities and attacks available for web servers and web \napplications. In our course our course Advanced Exploitation Techniques,\n you will learn what advanced exploitation techniques are and how you \ncan use them in your penetration testing.</p><p>  \t\tBecome White Hat Hacker and Learn Python<br></p><p>Delving\n into the world of coding can be intimidating. With so many complex \nlanguages and implementation possibilities, it's easy to become \noverwhelmed. By starting off with Python programming, you'll learn a \nsimple, versatile and highly readable code that you can execute on a \nwide variety of systems quickly and easily.</p><p><strong>Master one of the most popular programming languages in the world</strong></p><ul><li>Understand and implement basic Python code</li><li>Create and run a real-world Python program</li><li>Gain a knowledge of basic programming concepts</li></ul><p><strong>Learn a simple, streamlined coding language quickly and easily </strong></p><p>If\n you've never written a single line of code or if you're well-versed in \nmultiple program languages, Python Programming for Beginners will enable\n you to better understand programming concepts. </p><p>Widely regarded \nas one of the most simple and versatile programming languages out there,\n Python is used for web programming, video game building, microchip \ntesting, desktop apps, and so much more. Used by programmers, \ndevelopers, designers and everyone in between, it's one of the easiest \nprogramming languages to learn, and definitely the best starting point \nfor new coders. This course will not only give you an understanding of \nthe code, but will enable you to create and run real world Python \nprograms too. </p><br>",
