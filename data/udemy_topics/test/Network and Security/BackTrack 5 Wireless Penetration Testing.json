    "description": "<p>  \t  Armed with the essentials, you will learn how to conduct a host of cutting edge wireless attacks. You will learn how to execute attacks such as WLAN packet sniffing, revealing hidden SSIDs, open authentication by defeating MAC address filters, bypassing shared authentication, cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 encryption.  </p>  <p>  \t  In addition to documenting the essentials of wireless penetration testing, we will also discuss setting up rogue APs and wireless evil twins, client-based WEP cracking attacks, wireless infrastructure-based attacks, WPS PIN brute force attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, eavesdropping and session hijacking, EAP-based enterprise wireless hacking; and much more. Coverage also includes various countermeasures to protect wireless networks against these types of attacks, in order to help bolster the wireless security of any given network.  </p>  <h4 style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About the Author</strong></h4>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Farrukh Haroon Farhat</strong> is an information security professional with over 8 years of experience.
