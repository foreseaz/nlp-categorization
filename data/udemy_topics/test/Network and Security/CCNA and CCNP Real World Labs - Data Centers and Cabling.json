You've come to the right place.</p>\n\n<p>Yes! A real Data Center - you will watch an interview with a Director and get a tour, including an awesome presentation of services, racks, and modules. A lot of cool and advanced stuff that you will struggle to find anywhere else. Enough to say - I spent more than 6 months planning, visiting companies, and recording all lectures for you!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This training covers the physical layer as well. I show you <strong>professional cable testers and analyzers</strong> made by <strong>Fluke</strong> and <strong>IdealNetworks</strong>. There are several labs and examples I cover here, including VLAN identification on a switch, locating a broken network cable, and certifying a Cat 5e and Cat 6 network. It is enough to say that devices I show you cost thousands of dollars so stay tuned for the most advanced and expensive solutions used by professional engineers all over the world!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You know that passing an IT exam is not enough, right?
