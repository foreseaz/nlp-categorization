    "description": "<p>  \tThis course is over 10 hours in length and will cover<br>  \teverything from connecting to a router, configuring administrative tasks on the<br>  \trouter, learning the routers internal components such as RAM, ROM, NVRAM and<br>  \tFLASH; learning how to manipulate the Registers on the router, backing up<br>  \tconfigurations, using the CDP protocol, and all aspects of Static, Default and<br>  \tDynamic routing. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Please Note:</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Cisco Packet Tracer is a Cisco proprietary software and can only be given out by Cisco. So, if you hear me say in any of the lectures, that I would be providing the CPT, please disregard since I cannot do so.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">DISCLAIMER:   </strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Please note that the simulators/emulators used in this course are not part of the course. It is the students responsibility to have these to practice with. The Cisco Packet Tracer and/or VIRAL (Virtual Internet Routing Lab) are Cisco proprietary software and can only be obtained through Cisco. It is up to each student to obtain the simulator/emulator of their choice to study along with this course.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">If you are unable to get a hold of the CPT, remember that you have other options, like: GNS3, Boson or even live equipment.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is recommended that you use any of the simulators mentioned above to follow along with the course.</strong><br> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tStudents will get a thorough understanding of how the routing process actually works and they will also learn how to configure all inter-networking components using the Cisco Packet Tracer (link attached for download), look for it under external .  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tStudents will also be configuring RIPv2, EIGRP and OSPF and understand how to manipulate each routing protocols attributes to meet the requirements of the network.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tThis is a lecture based course using the Touch-IT Technology Smart board, which will make learning very interactive and engaging.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tHands on labs will be used to drill down the concepts learned in each lecture using the Cisco’s Packet Tracer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tMy method will make you feel like you are sitting in a classroom environment and give you the most needed hands on experience!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tHandouts will be available to facilitate learning and practice.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \tThis course is designed to help the student become comfortable with the routing concepts and router administration…but it will also help in preparing them for any networking certification or Computer Science Degree; not to mention the fact, that for those already in the field, it will further<br>  \timprove routing decisions in their particular networks.  </p>",
