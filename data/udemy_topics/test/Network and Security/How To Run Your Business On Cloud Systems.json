All of the systems required to run a company are available now. &nbsp;The huge time-and-cost roadblock of old fashioned IT is gone - for the companies that grab the opportunity. &nbsp;This course will teach you how.</p><p style=\"\">My aim in this course is to give business owners a blueprint for building and running their business on SaaS (&quot;Software as a Service&quot;) solutions. It&#039;s not a technical course for cloud-computing IT professionals. It&#039;s a pragmatic approach to evaluating, selecting and running cloud systems for business use.</p><p style=\"\">Some technical terms are unavoidable, so by design, the course materials are all visual, to help grasp the concepts and connections even if the terms are unfamiliar. &nbsp;When I mention specific companies and services, it&#039;s not a &#039;commercial endorsement&#039; - it&#039;s my opinion, based on firsthand use.</p><p style=\"\">You won&#039;t find this approach to business cloud-computing spelled out in any single book, because I haven&#039;t written it yet. &nbsp;I run two successful businesses this way, with a business partner and employees. &nbsp;We&#039;ve made mistakes, refined, evaluated and learned the hard way. &nbsp;Watching these lessons will, I hope, save you a few years of the same challenges and let you focus on your business!</p><p style=\"\">This is just a better way to get systems that support running and growing business. &nbsp;<span style=\"\">If you don&#039;t agree, or if it doesn&#039;t work for your specific business, contact me within 30 days and I&#039;ll happily refund your course fee. &nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p>  ",
