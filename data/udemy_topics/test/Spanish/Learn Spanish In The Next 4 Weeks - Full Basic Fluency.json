To live truly new place I often pay a visit to an old barber shop, shave and just chat. Barber shop is a frequent place with a good old shaving technique and space where you can hear well-narrated stories. This brings me into a daily life of locals and shows me joy of travel. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Unfortunately, it usually works if you speak a local language. The barbershop is real world for me and place where I need to know a couple of powerful words. </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">By taking this course you will learn how and which words to use in the specific locations. </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t After taking notes on fast language learning by using popular mobile applications, by reading thousands of reviews on Amazon (topics:Spanish e-books &amp; courses), by speaking with various language experts I was experimenting the fastest way to memorize essentials of new language and to combine the most commonly used words into thousands of phrases.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">This course will explain you exact steps on how to memorize and combine the most important words and it will teach you on how to express any idea in Spanish in 30 to 45 days.

Course narrows down the most frequently used words converted into daily-used sentences. It is designed in cooperation with <em>Observe language</em> methodology where student is using physical space to memorize vocabulary by using minimum effort.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t\t<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> How it works? </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t 1. We are reading carefully designed sentences in Spanish so you can learn how to pronounce words. Reading part is done by María Rodriguez, native Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t 2. After each exercise you will download provided sentences and post them around the house. (e.g. In the shower you can post these sentences translated in Spanish: \"I am taking a shower.\", \"Is there shower gel in the toilet.\", \"<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Can you pass me the towel please</strong>?\"). Each time when you are taking a shower you will read what is written on the wall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t After 5th shower you will memorize all sentences, then you will have chance to change word <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">towel </strong></em>with the word <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">soap</strong> </em>or <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">dress</strong></em> and like this you will learn to make own combinations of the phrases.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t 3. When you post all the words and sentences, you will just have to walk around the house and read the post-its = Like this you will memorize all the words and understand how to create own sentences.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t You do not want to glue post-its all over your house? No problem, this course has solution.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t 4. In less than 30 days you will learn up to 3000 the most frequently used words which allow you to express any idea in Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t + We are updating course each month with various language tips and new lessons</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t You can mail us anytime so we can send you various examples and introduce you to students who are already speaking Spanish thanks to this course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>* Important - This course is not for everyone. People have different learning needs. For many students, this course was like a revolution. They have discovered a simple way to speak Spanish. Other people prefer typical school curriculum and they cannot accept this kind of teaching/learning. I invite you to try-out.</p>",
