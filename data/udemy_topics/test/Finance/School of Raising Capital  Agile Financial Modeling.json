    "description": "<p style=\"\">&nbsp;Agile Financial Modeling is the latest addition to INVESTyR&#039;s &quot;School of Raising Capital&quot; where we educate entrepreneurs on gaining access to capital. This course focuses on a phrase we like to call &quot;Agile Financial Modeling&quot; which means to use lean principles while creating and updating financial documents. Entrepreneurs have a limited amount of time to get things done and ultimately, done is better than perfect. That&#039;s why Agile Financial Modeling is about speed. Financial assumptions are never going to be finished and there&#039;s no reason to think that you&#039;re building the final Pro Forma, etc. In under 6 weeks, you&#039;ll learn how to complete the bare minimum financial statements to get you to the next level.
