    "description": "<p>If you want to learn how to be a professional value investor, this course is for you.  This course is not for the faint of heart.  There&#039;s a lot of material.  You don&#039;t need much by way of prior knowledge, but you do need to make a significant time commitment. You&#039;re first going to learn how to determine the level of quality of a business.  This requires a detailed understanding of financial statements, financial metrics, return measures, soft factors (management quality, composition of board, competitive advantage, etc.), and red flags.  And you won&#039;t just use this independently, you&#039;ll put them within a broader framework.  You&#039;re then going to learn how to value a business.  I will cover many valuation techniques.  That way you can apply the one that makes the most sense given the circumstances.  Ideally, you want a divergence between quality and price.  That is, you want to buy a company that is high quality at a fair price, or an average quality business at a below average price.  The idea is to always look for those mis-pricings.  But unless you know how to assess quality and how to come up with a correct valuation, you&#039;ll never learn how to find geniune mispricings.  Lastly, all throughout this course we&#039;re going to help you build a mental framework that helps you to make smart decisions when things get tough.  There is no specified time that this course will take.  I recommend viewing the content multiple times.  Pause and digest when necessary, and when you get it, move on.      </p>",
