    "description": "<p>Financial Statement Analysis topic is in the curriculum of students studying accounting, finance or business related subjects at the top Universities in the world. This emphasizes the importance of this subject as a foundation of financial knowledge. While this topic is very broad and whole textbooks are dedicated to this subject, this course focuses only on the things that the students with beginner level knowledge need to know. This makes the course easy to follow, saves you time, and prevents you from being lost in the complicated data.</p><p>After completion of this course, you will have a solid understanding of financial statements, and be able to use the data contained in these statements to evaluate the performance of the firm. Who knows maybe you will become a successful investor, an entrepreneur, a finance analyst, an accountant or an auditor in the future? Then, there is no way to avoid this subject and you need to start by learning basics first.</p><p>The course is structured so that you will move up the ladder of necessary topics. First, the course builds your foundation on main financial statements: The Balance Sheet, The Income Statement, The Cash Flow Statement and The Statement of Stakeholder’s Equity. Then, in the second part, it shows how to extract more information from these financial statements using Ratio Analysis. It covers main ratios such as Profitability (Gross Margin, Operating Margin, EBIT Margin and Net Profit Margin), Liquidity (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio), Working capital ratios (Accounts Receivable Days, Accounts Receivable Turnover, Accounts Payable Days and Accounts Payable Turnover, Inventory Days and Inventory Turnover ratios), Interest coverage, Leverage, Valuation ratios (Market-to-Book ratio, Price-Earning ratio and Enterprise Value), Operating returns ratios (Asset Turnover, Return on Equity, Return on Assets, Return on Invested Capital) and shows how to calculate them and how to use them to interpret financial results. We will also discuss main factors to consider before making any decisions about the performance. All these topics are explained through a comprehensive example of a fictitious company that I have created to make it easier for you to understand and remember. Also, you will get a full summary of the ratios and their interpretation which will make it easier for you to learn from a single source. Finally, you will get a total of 40 multiple choice questions designed by me to test your knowledge on covered material. </p><p>I guarantee that this course will always be up to date. </p><p>Finally, this course comes with Udemy’s 30-day unconditional full money back guarantee.
