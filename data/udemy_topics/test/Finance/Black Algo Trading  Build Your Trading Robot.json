What is a Trading Robot? </strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t A Trading Robot a set of programming codes that analyses and trade the market on its own. Trading Robots allow you to trade the markets without human intervention!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t<strong>What does this course offer?</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t This course teaches the insider knowledge to designing, testing and coding long term profitable robots. We do NOT promise that you will strike it rich overnight. We do not make ridiculous claims (like those you see in newspapers and online ads) that you will make $3722 every night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t This course WILL, however, offer you the years of experience we have in building Robots. You will understand the pitfalls and keys to success to design great robots. You will avoid the hundreds of mistakes we made in my journey.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t This course does not only teach programming. Programming is just the tool we use to execute our ideas. The main essence of the course is the design theories behind the Trading Robots. These theories and knowledge come from years of industry practice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t At the end of the day you will acquire the ability to generate a trading idea, code the idea (within 1hour), test the idea, see the strength and flaws in the idea, improve and finally execute the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\t</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chapters - Full List (These are Sections NOT Lectures!)</strong><br><strong>&lt;Course 1: Black Algo Trading – Build Your Trading Robot&gt;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Here's What You Are In For!</li><li>Programming Basics 1: Variables and Conditional</li><li>Robot 1: Adeline - Our First Robot!</li><li>Uncommon Common Sense.

It entails a graphical, step-by-step approach with minimal technical jargon. <br>But of course, you will need to put in more effort than someone with a stronger background to master the content.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>// I can't code! Is this course suitable for me?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this course is designed for those who are new at programming. We have a 24/7 support channel to assist you with coding issues!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>// I can code! Is this course suitable for me?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you can code MQL4, you can probably skip the coding lectures. The value you gain will come mainly from the lectures on Robot Design and Market Theories.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>// What if I am unhappy with the course?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We would never want you to be unhappy!
