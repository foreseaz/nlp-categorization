If  we have more Long Options than Short, the position is called a Back Spread and  if we have more Short Options than Long, the position is called a Ratio Spread.  In a Ratio spread, you have unlimited losses on one side because you have more  Short Options. The Back Spread is part of the BUSY PROFESSIONAL SERIES can be  constructed in many creative ways, and we show you how you can manage different  strike prices as well as different ratios of Long and Short Options to  construct an optimal Back <strong style=\"\">Option Spreads</strong>. We don&#039;t recommend Ratio spreads as they have an unlimited  loss potential.</p><p></p>  <h5>What you will master</h5><ul style=\"\"><li>What is the philosophy of Back spreads and Ratio spreads<br style=\"\"></li><li>Different creative possibilities with the Back spread<br style=\"\"></li><li>How should we look at the Greeks in a Back Spread<br style=\"\"></li><li>Importance of understanding the &quot;Valley of death&quot;<br style=\"\"></li><li>How should we avoid the valley of death<br style=\"\"></li><li>Why is this a Volatility strategy<br style=\"\"></li><li>Why do we not recommend a Ratio spread<br style=\"\"></li><li>Why is the back Spread a great trade for the busy professional<br style=\"\"></li></ul><ul style=\"\"><ul style=\"\"><ul style=\"\"><ul style=\"\">  </ul>  </ul>  </ul>  </ul><h5><br style=\"\"></h5><h5>SECTION II - DIAGONALS AND DOUBLE DIAGONALS&nbsp;</h5>    <p>The Diagonal is a variation of the Calendar time spread, and it tends to reduce the Vega exposure of a Calendar spread. Due to this fact, it also has a Delta bias when the trade is put on. It is important that you understand and become a master at trading Calendar spreads before you try a Diagonal spread. Although the Diagonal has very similar characteristics as a Calendar spread, the Diagonal is a complex variation of the Calendar spread. Just like in Calendars, the easiest adjustment to a Diagonal spread is to convert it into a Double Diagonal on the losing side, and the course covers this adjustment in detail. You will also benefit from a higher Theta decay than in regular Calendars, however the compromise you make is that the risk exposure in higher than a Calendar, and you also have a Delta bias.</p><h5>What you will master</h5>    <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>What are Diagonals and how do they differ from Calendars</li>  \t<li>Why are they difficult to adjust</li>  \t<li>What are the normal adjustments for a Diagonal</li><li>How the double diagonal increases your profit zone and your max profit area</li><li>Why does Diagonals have better Theta decay than Calendars</li><li>Why do Diagonals reduce the impact of Vega</li><li>Why is there a higher risk in Diagonals than Calendars</li>  \t  </ul><h5><br style=\"\"></h5><h5>SECTION III - BUTTERFLY SPREADS</h5><p>The Butterfly is a low  risk, high reward, and low probability strategy. The Butterfly involves 3  different Options including Long and Short options, so it can be a bit  difficult to manage once its put on. But the Butterfly can produce great  results if it works, and in many cases the cost of the Butterfly is minimal,  and if you&#039;re lucky, you may even receive a credit for the Butterfly. Both  these trades are generally put on by hardcore Options traders. The Butterfly  trade should not be your regular &quot;bread and butter&quot; trade in the  sense that you can&#039;t rinse and repeat this strategy all the time for consistent  monthly income. But the Butterfly can be an excellent strategy in very specific  circumstances - like protecting the losing side of an Iron condor or a credit  spread. Another great application for the Butterfly is during an earnings  report. Both of these specific applications are covered in detail in this  course of Advanced Options Strategies.</p><p></p>  <h5>What you will master</h5>          <ul style=\"\"><li>Why is the Butterfly a low risk, high reward strategy</li><li>What is the probability of the Butterfly producing fantastic results</li><li>How do we adjust Butterflies</li><li>Why the Butterfly is a speculative strategy</li><li>Why is the Butterfly not a &quot;bread and butter&quot; trade</li><li>What are the specific instances where a Butterfly can work</li><li>When does the Butterfly generate its maximum profits</li><li>How can use Butterfly trades as a hedge to protect our monthly income strategies</li></ul>  \t  \t  ",
