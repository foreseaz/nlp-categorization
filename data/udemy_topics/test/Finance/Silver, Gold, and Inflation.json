    "description": "<p>Inflation is a hidden tax.</p>    <p>Just as Income, Sales, and Property  taxes confiscate your wealth, so does the Inflation tax.<span>&nbsp; It’s just hidden from you. </span></p>    <p>It’s not overt.<span>&nbsp; You didn’t vote for it. Most people cannot describe what it is  exactly.</span></p>    <p>The effect of inflation is the erosion  of the purchasing power of the Dollar.</p>    <p>As its value erodes, it takes more  dollars to purchase a set amount of gold.<span>&nbsp;  </span></p>    <p>Just as we would not save in, say,  bananas – which will decay over time and become worthless - we don’t really  want to save in dollars, which also decay over time and become worth less and  less until they too, in time,<span>&nbsp; become  worthless.</span></p>    <p>Perhaps a quote from Alan Greenspan  describes the problem the best. <span>&quot;In  the absence of a gold standard there is no way to protect savings from  confiscation through inflation.&quot;</span></p>    <p>The course  consists of a series of 100 slides from a college lecture. </p>    <p>It should take just under one hour to complete.</p>    <p>Instructor consultation  will be via e-mail contact.</p>  ",
