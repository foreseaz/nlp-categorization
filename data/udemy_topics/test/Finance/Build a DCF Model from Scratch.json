    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course will walk you through two Discounted Cash Flow (&quot;DCF&quot;) models to properly introduce all relevant concepts. The first DCF model will use everyday context to make the process easy to understand. The video runs less than 10 minutes long, and uses a simple example to introduce the purpose of DCF analysis.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Once the &quot;Basic Discounted Cash Flow Model&quot; has been introduced, the material will explain two concepts separately: Net Present Value (&quot;NPV&quot;) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (&quot;WACC&quot;).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The last video walks through a more thorough discounted cash flow (&quot;DCF&quot;) model. In this video we will use an integrated financial statement model to perform a DCF analysis of a company.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  All videos are recorded in HD.
