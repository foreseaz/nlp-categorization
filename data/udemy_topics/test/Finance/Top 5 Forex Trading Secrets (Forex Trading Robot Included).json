You will not only have a technological solution developed by professionals but start earning right now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Let Me Introduce Myself</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Andrew Minin. I've been working as a professional currency dealer and financial engineer for the largest American and European investment banks for over ten years and you know what... I am astounded by incompetence of the people who run lectures, write books, blogs, create websites, or forums, regarding trading on Forex or other financial markets...</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">First of all, there's too much information even in the best textbooks about trading...</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, In Colby's “The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators\". There's 834 pages, 127 indicators (and those are just classical!). And what to use still remains a mystery... </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Secondly, for those who studying FOREX trading, the market behavior remains unclear...</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, do you really know what to do or what is going to happen if US GDP reduce by 5%? </p>\n\n\n\n<ul> <li>USD shall go down because of US economy weakness? </li> <li>Dollar value shall rise because investors will go out from securities to cash? </li> <li>Nothing will happen, because investors have discounted the information in advance... Do you know the exact answer?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why one respectable analyst tells you one thing, and another one speaks differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the most important question is: “What do you have to do?\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Third, you have probably traded on FOREX for some time but haven't become rich yet...</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You're to told to find your own strategy... That you have to go on searching, learning, practicing... </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it's merely meets the interests of companies which fund this business... To maintain your interest in that, to develop discussions on various forums speculating around same questions from different points of view... In order to benefit from those books sales... And simply because <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">they do not know how</strong></em> to start earning on the financial markets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this Udemy course \"Forex Trading: Top 5 Secrets on Forex\" I'll tell you secrets of trading on financial markets including FOREX. So that you won't have to dig through dozens of books, websites and forums seeking the answer... To hesitate on what positions to open, how to interpret information and whom of the analysts to trust, to constantly look for the “Holy Grail\". </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After I tell you the 5th secret, you'll have a chance to get a detailed video that describes step-by-step how to implement everything I tell you in your MetaTrader 4 terminal. As well as <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you'll have a chance to download and install a profitable trading system to try all that for real</em></strong>... </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">FAQ</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Is the robot is good?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is \"good\" is up to you. There are no trading robots with profits and without risk in nature. The higher the risk, the higher your profits in general. In this course we learn how to correctly test and optimize the robot to have all the information you need to decide after that are an obtained expected risk and return acceptable for you or not, and only then try to work with it.<br></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n\n<p>U.S. Government Required Disclaimer - Commodity Futures Trading Commission Futures and Options trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk.
