    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t       How To Be A High Performance Insurance Broker was designed for insurance agency principals, brokers, and agents to show you the exact steps to creating your practice precisely the way you want it to be. The course was designed to help you unlock all of the potential that you and your practice possess. This is the complete guide for insurance professionals who want to maximize revenue, maximize profit, and enjoy their practice more, while not adding more hours to their work week. It has come out of the culmination of 11 years of working directly with agency principals on development and peak performance.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t We highly recommend you take all four parts, however, each part is a comprehensive course in and of itself.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Materials Included:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Video Lectures</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Handouts</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Exercises</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Time Requirements:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Lectures &amp; Handouts 4 hours</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Exercise 2 - 4 hours</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t       In part 2, you will learn why self confidence is the single greatest predictor of success and how self confidence is developed.  You will also learn how talent, skill, and self confidence all work in conjunction and in an endless “loop” to propel you to higher levels of performance.  You’ll also learn why proper mind management plays the greatest role in your behaviors and outcomes and why, as we say, if you manage your mind, you manage your destiny.  Finally, you’ll learn why resilience is necessary to reach your highest levels of performance and how to develop more of it.  </p>",
