    "description": "<p>If you are reading this I am guessing you are interested in learning how to invest in the stock market. You understand the importance of saving and investing for the future. </p>\n\n<p>You know that it’s possible to make money investing, and you want to learn how to do it. But investing is considered risky and the last thing you want to do is to lose a big chunk of your savings by making a bad investment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And let’s be honest, we all like the idea of becoming wealthy and having the financial freedom to do what we want. We all want to have a stock portfolio that grows larger and larger every year, providing us with a passive income.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">But the reality is that most people lose money in the stock market. Why? Is it actually realistic to be able to make money investing? The answer is “yes”.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few investors who are able to outperform the market consistently, the most famous one being Warren Buffett. The question then becomes: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>“What is the difference between Buffett, and other investors like him, and the average investor?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is the framework and principles that they use. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In this course you will learn a simple, yet powerful framework, and the principles that the world’s best investors have used for decades to beat the market.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Many believe that you have to do something extraordinary to invest successfully.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But this is simply not true. I believe anyone can learn how to become a successful investor, no matter their background. Just listen to Warren Buffett:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>\"The most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect.”</em></li><li><em>\"It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.\"</em></li><li><em>\"There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.\"</em></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Buffett is seen by many as the greatest investor in history and he has amassed a personal fortune of $66 billion dollars. You might tell yourself that you could never do what Buffett has done, however he has personally said that his success is based on <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">simple principles that anyone can learn.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">This course will teach you Buffett’s method of investing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">HOWEVER</strong>, just because value investing is based on a simple set of principles, it does not mean it’s easy. Like anything else in life that you want to master, you have to put in the time and effort. If it were easy, everyone would be doing it. But if you are willing to put in a little extra effort, your chances of success will increase drastically.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">----What You Will Learn----</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m probably not going out on a limb when I assume that you are a busy person? There’s never enough time to accomplish everything we want to. Even if you are interested in learning how to become a better investor, you might feel you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">don’t have the time?</strong> Or if you have the time to invest, you feel overwhelmed and you might not know <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">where to start?</strong> For example, how do you find undervalued stocks and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">how do you know if a company is a good investment or not?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will teach you the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">most important principles of value investing in a quick and efficient manner.</strong> You will learn how to find undervalued stocks and how to figure out how much a company is worth. You will learn a simple step-by-step framework that will help you determine if a company is a good investment or not, as well as how to reduce your risk.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will be able to determine quickly, and with confidence, if a company is potentially a good investment or not. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">----How The Course Is Laid Out----</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The course is broken up in <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">small lessons that are easy to follow</strong>. And everything is explained in simple terms. Investing is often made more complex than it needs to be, but that’s not the case with this course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will learn the essential concepts that are needed to become a successful investor, and we will use case studies and examples to teach you how it’s done in real life. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the course you will learn:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><p>The Three Most Important Principles To Being A Successful Investor</p></li><li><p>The Phenomenon That Made Warren Buffett A Billionaire </p></li><li><p>The Two Rules That Will Set You Apart From 99% Of Investors</p></li><li><p>The Big Secret To Investment Success</p></li><li><p>The Four Most Important Qualities To Look For In A Company</p></li><li><p>How To Determine How Much A Company Is Worth</p></li><li><p>How To Find Undervalued Stocks</p></li><li><p>And much more</p></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this course you will be able to determine which investments have the potential for large returns, and which ones to avoid. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to re-iterate that after taking this course, you still have to put in the work. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts to becoming rich. You have to be willing to put in the time and effort. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But this course is a great place to start! Maybe you’ve always wanted to learn about investing, but you never knew where to begin? Or maybe you felt you never had the time? If that’s the case, then I believe you will find a lot of value in this course.   </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are not many things that are as important as learning how to save and invest for the future. But the majority of people never learn how to take care of their finances. By the end of this course you will have learned important concepts that most people will unfortunately never bother to learn - concepts that will help you make money in the stock market. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">----Who This Course Is For----</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is for beginners, so i<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">f you already have a good fundamental knowledge of value investing, this is probably NOT the course for you.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, it’s <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">NOT for people who want to make money quickly.</strong> This course is for people who want to invest for the long-term. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And I agree that some people might not want to pay $50 (£45) for a course, and that’s fine. However I believe the issue is not the price, but rather the value you can get from the course. If you are serious about investing you probably already have some money you want to invest. If you invest $5,000 and only earn a 1% return, you have already paid for the course. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the price of the course is similar to buying approximately 3 investing books. Most of the information you will learn in such books are already covered in the course, and it’s delivered in an easy to follow format. And that’s not to mention the time you will save by taking the course as opposed to reading the books. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to learn how to invest like a value investor, please sign up for the course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong>, so you have nothing to lose</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I look forward to seeing you on the inside.</p>",
