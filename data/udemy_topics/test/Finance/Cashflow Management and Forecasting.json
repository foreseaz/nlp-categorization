    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    The course is about how to forecast sales and how to manage and improve upon your own personal cashflow. We cover what cashflow is, ways in which cash flows in to us, improvements to the cashflow, cashflow problems and how to reduce your debt to improve the cashflow situation. Many people have payments going out to cover debt repayments (or to just service the debt ie through interest payments) and this in itself can be a huge obstacle to improving the cashflow - and this is also something that the course covers.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  There&#039;s a video to explain the concepts of:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Sales forecasting</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Cashflow management</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t  And a downloadable book for reducing debt levels - to improve the cashflow.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    The course will take approx 1 hour to complete.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    It&#039;s  an ideal course if you are working in the accounts / finance department  and/or if you are thinking of embarking on a career in accountancy or  bookkeeping and part of your requirement is to create cashflow forecasts and  report back to the owners of the firm.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you are thinking of  starting your own business and want to plan your business better and how you can improve  upon those numbers, then this course is for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Also, if you are trying to improve your own personal financial situation, then understanding how cashflow works, and how it can be better managed will be very useful for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  The type of terminology you can expect on the course is largely business-focused, so we&#039;ll talk about assets, liabilities, expenses, income, forecasting, projecting, cashflow, budgeting - a lot of &#039;accounting&#039; talk. These concepts are explained, and we don&#039;t expect the students to have any prior knowledge of any of this.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  You are also given a cashflow forecast template - which you can use for your business, and a template for your personal figures, so that you can use this material for your personal life too.  </p>",
