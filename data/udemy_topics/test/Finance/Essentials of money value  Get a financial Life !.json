You will be able to set realistic financial goals which would put you in charge of your money and your life. Be it at an individual level or managerial level, your success depends on understanding the value of money in its different dimensions. Many people take a passive role in managing their finances as they are confused with the world of money and finance. They continue with their rat-race, save a few bucks in some retirement fund, settling for meager returns year-after-year,without knowing  what value their savings are worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is here to give you some basic idea on how one should look at money values. There are other options for those who are willing to change the way they look at money. A thorough understanding of the value of money is the key to one’s personal financial success. Money is just not a currency note with numbers and symbols on it or a plastic card with a bank logo and an account number. It is something else entirely. This course will help you analyse the meaning of the value of money,  where money has been, and where it is going.</p>",
