System code included.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>“Trend following methods have been the simplest, most successful trading methods for decades\" </em></strong>– Perry J Kaufmann</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to beating the stock market, there are few strategies that can offer such consistent returns as the strategy of trend following.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Trend followers made a killing in 2008, when the whole financial system was in meltdown and they made millions in 2014, just when the sceptics were saying the strategy was dead. And some of the best trend following funds have been in operation for over 40 years, building up funds with billions of dollars in assets.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, most big trend following funds operate in the realm of managed futures but there is significant evidence that trend following can be applied just as successfully to stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On this course, you will learn the full rules to an original trend following strategy that can be used in the stock market. Rules that anyone can master and put into practice with just a couple of hours work a week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who am I? </strong>My name's Joe Marwood and I'm a trader originally from London, England. I've been trading trend following systems on stocks for years and over the next couple of hours, I will build and then disclose this complete trend following strategy for stocks that has been rigorously tested on historical stock market data.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I go through the fundamentals of trend following, the theory, the secrets, and the steps necessary to build a robust and reliable trend trading strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>I also record live system back-tests so you can see the real, unaltered, system results and the system equity curve for yourself.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a strategy that is simple enough for any investor to understand yet sophisticated enough to show incredible annual returns versus the benchmark. It's a strategy that has been able to capture some huge multi-week trends in some of the best stocks on the market. And this strategy can be applied to other global stock markets too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The trend following for stocks strategy is suitable for:</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>• Full-time and part-time traders.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>• Investors seeking to diversify their existing portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>• Traders and investors looking to passively build wealth and income.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>• Those seeking alternate investment strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have guessed, this is not another get rich quick scheme or day trading system with a high failure rate. Rather, this is a straightforward and mechanical approach to following trends in stocks designed to compound your wealth and beat the market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The strategy can be used on it's own or as part of a fully diversified investment portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stop following the news and start following the trend today.</strong></p>",
