This course will give you the tips tricks and Free Tools to Master your personal finances and start to build Wealth instead of just get by.</p><p>This course will take less than a half hour, but could save you years of struggling. All you need is a computer, internet connection and the drive to take a few steps to  get you on course to a comfortable retirement.</p><p>This is all content that I believe should have been taught or provided in High School but I believe most middle school students  could follow along. And while most dread the thought of a budget I hope I've been able to keep it fun and simple enough to implement.<br></p>",
