As you know, the purchase price of bonds fluctuates as market conditions change and with this course, you will see how the purchase price of a bond will change over time.  You will be provided with a set of notes which you will use when you are watching the videotaped lectures.  The course will probably take 3-4 days to complete although this will vary for different students.  </p>",
