Using the Four Core Arts of the Trade Show Samurai; including engagement, intrigue, inquiry and disengagement, your company will capture more leads than you ever thought possible. Achieving a 1000% increase in lead capture is not unusual. This seminar is well-suited for anyone who exhibits at trade shows. Often attended by beginners, it is also a huge eye-opener for seasoned professionals.
