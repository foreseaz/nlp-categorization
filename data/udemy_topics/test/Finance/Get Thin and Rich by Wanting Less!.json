This course is the foundation upon which financial independence will be built. The co-authors, Alan MacDonald (a chartered financial analyst and chartered financial planner who has worked as an financial advisor for 30 years) and Paul LaBarge (a senior tax partner at his own law firm who also specializes in business law, arbitration, estate and financial planning) have had, literally, thousands of conversations about personal finances. The same patterns keep showing up among those who have successfully achieved financial independence, and those who do not. You don&#039;t need a business degree to understand or implement the successful routines. A relatively short initial investment of time will see you equipped with tools that can be used easily and successfully through the rest of your life to keep your cash flow under control and your spending focused against the things that are most important to you and your family. </p><p style=\"\">The course is divided into 3 major sections and will take 8 hours to complete. All exercises are included and all you need is a computer with speakers, pen and paper, and an eagerness to learn how to start living a financially fit lifestyle!</p>",
