We start with how financial statements are adjusted by companies and analysts to show &quot;non-GAAP&quot; results. Then we cover deferred taxes and the activities that create them. Next we cover inter-company investments, with a specific focus on the application of the equity method and consolidation method. We finish by addressing accounting issues that emerge from various debt-related activities, like original issue discount, PIKs, and capitalized interest.</span>  </p>",
