    "description": "<p>What is this course about?</p>\n\n<p>This course is about the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">practical application</strong> of Elliott Wave Theory developed by Sir Ralph Nelson Elliott, according to which the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">prices in the stock market reflect the crowd psychology of humans which being repetitive forms patterns. These patterns being recognizable on the chart give us predictive power.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course you will learn all about these patterns from the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">point of application in Day Trading, Swing Trading and Investment, </strong>also you will see how can we use the concept of <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Fibonacci Ratios</strong> and the concept of <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Channeling</strong> along with some other concepts to add more predictive power to our analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What is special about this course?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This is a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">PRACTICAL COURSE</strong> (on Elliott Wave Principles), that is I have <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">explained all the concepts on live charts</strong> rather then a meaningless slide show, also I will keep updating this course with more examples on regular basis so as to keep new ideas coming.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have included various case scenarios throughout the course, some chart discussions depict Intraday Trade analysis, some depict Swing Case scenario while others discuss long term prospects from an Investors point of view.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the course I have discussed the basic thought process in a systematic manner so that viewers can understand the complete application part.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What is the aim of this course?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The aim behind this course is to make anyone who takes this course efficient enough to do their own analysis based on the Elliott Wave Principles and be able to make <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Intraday Trading</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Swing Trading</strong> or <strong>Investment decisions</strong> based on their learning.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
