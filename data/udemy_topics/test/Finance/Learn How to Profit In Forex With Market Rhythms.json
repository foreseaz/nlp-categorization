    "description": "<p>  \t<em>Course Updated 5th September With New Added Video</em>  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will teach you how to understand market rhythms and how to integrate them into your trading. Market rhythm is applicable whatever time frame, trading instrument or trading system you use and will help you both increase profits and just as important, reduce losses!  </p>  <p>  \t      This course was created because there is very little usable information available on market rhythms and how they affect your trading and yet it is a vital part of any trading decision that you make. Market rhythms apply to the movement of the market, candle patterns and chart patterns. Price action does not form in a vacuum; there are transitions from one type of price action to another. The market tends to form rhythmic price action which then transitions through to non-rhythmic price action. By understanding what the market is telling you, you can make better trading decisions.  </p>  <p>  \t      The course is presented in a nice and simple to understand fashion and the creator is on hand to answer any student questions. The course is dynamic and will be added to over time.  </p>  <p>  \t      To get an idea of the potential value of this new course, here are some comments on my other books and courses from my readers and students.  </p>  <p>  \t      LR’s video course is to the point, clear, accurate and profitable  </p>  <p>  \t      “LR’s High ROI Trading Video Course contains possibly the best (i.e. the most profitable for a given risk) FOREX education content of any on the internet. And the course takes a lot of the mental barriers away by defining clear and unambiguous rules. I have participated in many expensive courses, and while I learned something from all of them, this Course hits sixes to the boundary every time.”  </p>  <p>  \t      So SIMPLE, yet SO POWERFUL! ANOTHER out of the park Home-Run!  </p>  <p>  \t      By Pipskateer on December 17, 2013  </p>  <p>  \t      Format: Kindle Edition  </p>  <p>  \t      MATH is definitely KING where trading money management is concerned, and LR Thomas is ALL OVER IT! If ever there was a case for PURPOSELY STRUCTURING your trades on a FOUNDATION of MATHEMATICS, LR Thomas has MADE IT quite convincingly. The strategies outlined in “Pyramid Your Trades To Profit” will GREATLY enhance the possibilities of EXPONENTIALLY increasing trading profits from the already excellent low risk/high reward 10XROI and Trade Around Your Job systems offered in Thomas’ other books. The really AMAZING thing about these strategies is that you can “pyramid” your profits WITHOUT increasing your risk per trade!! Who would NOT want to do THAT? Just simply PHENOMENAL..  </p>  <p>  \t    ABOUT THE COURSE CREATOR  </p>  <p>  \t    I have been a trader for 9 years and I know what a struggle it can be. I have been using my systems for the past three years and I decided to share them with other traders so they can hopefully short cut their time to becoming a profitable trader. I am a bestselling Amazon author and also run a blog where I keep my readers and students updated.  </p>  <p>  \t    It is important to note that ALL the trading systems were designed to slot into each other and to be traded together. This means that you can add each system to your trading system with confidence knowing that you are adding more opportunities and they can all be traded without conflict  </p>",
