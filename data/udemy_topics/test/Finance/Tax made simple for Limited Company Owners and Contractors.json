However, running a limited company rather than working as a sole trader can seem a bit of a daunting prospect with the additional paperwork and administrative responsibilities.  Limited company taxes are indeed more complicated but people are often put off by the terms and jargons used. Donâ€™t let this put your off from forming your own limited company as there are several clear benefits to your income. This course is designed to go through in detail what it means to set-up and run limited company, what the tax savings are and how you can reduce your tax bill through several strategies and therefore retain more of your company income/profits and pay less tax to the HMRC.  </p>",
