    "description": "<p>Have you ever been shocked at how much your bank charges you to convert your money into a different currency?  Not only are there transaction fees, but you also lose an additional percentage in the currency exchange margins that banks use for these transactions.  It's a double hit on your pocket.</p><p>I've been working online for over a decade, and getting most of my income in US dollars.  That's really not ideal, because I live in Spain where we use the Euro.  To complicate it even more, I also have a bank account in the UK in pounds sterling.  I regularly have to convert currencies and send money between my bank accounts, but using banks ends up costing me a fortune in fees.  This is where CurrencyFair came to my rescue.  </p>\n\n<p>Currency Fair is a peer-to-peer network that cuts out the middle man (the bank), meaning you get to keep more of your money when converting from one currency to another.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how it works:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Person A has euros and want pounds sterling.</li><li>Person B has pounds sterling and wants euros.</li><li>CurrencyFair has created a marketplace where you can effectively swap currencies at an exchange rate that suits person A and person B.</li></ol>\n\n<p>It's a simple idea, and it works extremely well.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, I'll introduce you to the idea of using a service like Currency Fair for your currency conversions.  I'll explain my own situation, and why I needed a service like this.  I'll then take you through the process, from signing up, to getting your currency converted and sent to your bank account.</p>\n\n<p>I'll show you how much a bank would charge for a typical transfer, and then I'll show you a real conversion of mine, that I did with CurrencyFair.  This is an up to date conversion that I did as I was creating this course, so you'll get to see how much I managed to save on the currency conversion.</p>\n\n<p>This course is for anyone that needs to transfer money between one currency to another.</p>",
