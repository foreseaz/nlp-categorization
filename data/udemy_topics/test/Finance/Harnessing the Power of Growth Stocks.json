    "description": "<p style=\"\">The late Benjamin Graham had a greater influence on the way  stocks are analyzed, bought and sold than any other investor in the history of  the stock market. While he has been referred to as the “Dean of Wall Street,”  the “Father of Value Investing” and the “Father of Security Analysis,” all you  really need to know about Graham is that he was the lifelong mentor of Warren  Buffett. Buffet studied under Graham at <a href=\"#\" id=\"FALINK_2_0_1\" style=\"\">Columbia University</a>,  then worked for him for two decades before striking out on his own to build his  Berkshire Hathaway investment empire.</p>  <p style=\"\">In 1962, Graham laid out a brilliant and unprecedented concrete  formula and strategy for <a href=\"#\" id=\"FALINK_1_0_0\" style=\"\">investing in</a> growth stocks in his book, <em style=\"\">Security Analysis</em>. That chapter  disappeared in later editions of the book, but money manager Fredrick Martin,  has used Graham’s formula and strategy in <a href=\"#\" id=\"FALINK_1_0_0\" style=\"\">buying stocks</a> with great success,  earning an average annual return of more than 16 percent over a 30-year period.  In Martin’s recent book, <em style=\"\">Benjamin Graham  and the Power of Growth Stocks</em> (fair disclosure: the course instructor had  the privilege of helping to write and edit the book), Martin laid out Graham’s  formula and the techniques Martin used to build his portfolio.</p>  <p style=\"\"><p style=\"\">This Stock Trading Course will help you  incorporate Graham’s and Martin’s investment formulas and strategies to help  you build a potent portfolio of long-term growth stocks aimed at helping you  beat the market and prepare for a secure retirement. </p>  <p style=\"\">The “Stock Trading Course: Growth Stocks”  course includes nearly 90 minutes of lecture with more than 50 slides designed  to simplify the investment process.
