    "description": "<p>This course covers everything you need to know to succeed with your grade 2 ABRSM theory exam.  The course consists of video lectures, quizzes and additional work sheets to help you with your study.  This course is classed at beginner level and although it would be beneficial to have studied the grade 1 syllabus first it is possible to work through this course with limited music theory knowledge.  The course will be a great resource to you if you intend to take an exam or just want to gain that extra knowledge. This grade 2 course provides more detail than that found in the grade 1 syllabus and will extend your knowledge in new areas of work not covered in the earlier grade.  With over 60 minutes of video tutorials you will glide through the syllabus with everything being explained clearly and in a concise manner.  You can pause the videos at any time to take notes on the notepad provided.  You will find additional PDF worksheets to further help with your study. Don't forget at the end of the tutorials to print your completion certificate.  If you are a musician why take this course?  If you understand the meaning of time, rhythm and musical symbols you will find it is easier and more rewarding when trying to read music. The reading of music will open many doors in your musical journey.  You will be able to join other groups of musicians, large or small to enjoy making music together.  If you are serious about your musicianship this course is the stepping stone to higher levels and will give you all the necessary skills to continue your study to grade 5 and above.</p>",
