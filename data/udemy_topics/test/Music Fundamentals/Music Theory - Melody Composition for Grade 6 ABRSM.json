    "description": "<p>If you are taking the ABRSM Grade 6 Music Theory exam, this unique course will help you get top marks.</p><p>Many people find that working under exam conditions, without access to a piano or similar, makes music composition a difficult task. Others may have a natural talent for crafting a good tune, but are perhaps unsure of the specific requirements set out by the ABRSM examining board - just what are you supposed to write? And what makes a composition good or bad - is it completely subjective? (No!)</p><ul style=\"\"><li>In this course, I will set out the marking criteria for you in a clear and structured way, so you know exactly what it is you are supposed to be writing.</li><li>You&#039;ll then learn how to complete your composition according to the expectations of the examiners, and you&#039;ll discover that with just a knowledge of scales, chords and intervals a beautiful composition can be invented <strong style=\"\">even if you can&#039;t hear it in your head</strong>.</li><li>You&#039;ll learn specifically how to work with rhythmic and melodic ideas and to adapt them, how to create a plausible and confident harmonic structure, and how to create an effective modulation to any related key: to the dominant, subdominant or relative major/minor.</li></ul><span></span><p>The course includes detailed explanations, (without overloading you with superfluous information), real-time worked compositions in a major and minor key, worked out before your eyes, and lots of freebie downloads including lesson summaries, exercises and compositions to work through yourself. </p><p>I&#039;ll also offer feedback on your personal exam-question compositions, if you post them in the discussion section. </p><p>After teaching music theory for many years, I&#039;ve seen hundreds (if not thousands!) of grade 6 compositions, and know exactly what kind of mistakes candidates make. I&#039;d love to help <strong style=\"\">you </strong>this time around, and work with you to getting top marks in your exam.</p><p>Send me a message (click on my name) if you have any questions about this course, and do take a look at the videos marked &quot;preview&quot; in the list below, to see what&#039;s in store!</p>",
