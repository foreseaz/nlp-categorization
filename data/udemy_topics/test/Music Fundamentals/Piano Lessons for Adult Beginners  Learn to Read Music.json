    "description": "<p>Many of the piano students I have the privilege of working with approach me with the false notion that they simply don't have what it takes to be able to read music. This course is designed to prove that anyone with a desire to learn the valuable skill of reading music notation <em style=\"\">can</em> in fact learn to read music and, to take it a step further, that they can do so in a way that won't cause them anxiety and frustration.  </p><p><strong style=\"\">Learn the Fundamentals of Sight-Reading Piano Music by Mastering Your Understanding of Rhythmic Notation</strong></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Simplify sight-reading one rhythmic concept at a time.</li><li style=\"\">Dig into the bass clef to help you unlock the secrets of your favorite songs.</li><li style=\"\">Learn new concepts gradually and only as they are needed.</li><li style=\"\">Apply new concepts to your practice exercises and to short performances right away.</li></ul><p><strong style=\"\">In short, t</strong><strong style=\"\">his course will help you to acquire the skills necessary to confidently approach a new piece of sheet music that you want to learn on your own.</strong></p><p>Being able to read music is an essential skill for the majority of music jobs that exist in the world as we know it. These include teaching, accompanying, film scoring, songwriting, studio recording, and a variety of performing gigs. But being able to read music also provides a musician with a wonderful personal gift: the ability to learn to play the music that moves them. </p><p>In this course you'll learn about rhythmic note values that range from whole notes all the way down to rapid 16th notes and all of their related rests. You will learn to recognize the most common symbols that appear in written music. You will learn to not be intimidated by the jungle of dots and lines that contain the information necessary to perform your favorite pieces of music.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Course Overview</strong></p><p>The course is organized into ten units that each tackle a rhythmic concept. These concepts increase in difficulty only very gradually so that you never feel like you are asked to do something that is over your head. Supporting the rhythm-focused center of each unit are related concepts that enhance your musical understanding and widen the breadth of your playing ability. During each unit, you will be given exercises to play on the piano that will reinforce the concepts you are learning.</p><p>Unlike most piano method materials, you will learn the bass clef first. This choice is meant to encourage you to attend to the movement of low pitches - all in the pursuit of a more holistic understanding of the music you listen to and play. You will also be learning about the treble clef and, by the end of the course, you will be able to play music that is written for two hands.</p><p>At the end of each unit, you will be asked to put your training to the test in a short performance of a piece of music that will feature recently-learned concepts. As you progress through the units, you will discover that your performance pieces are all part of the same composition. In other words, by the end of the course, you will have played all of the parts to a single piece of music and you will be able to hear what they sound like when played together. For your last project, you will be challenged to learn a specific piece of music entirely on your own.</p><p>You are going to learn a ton about reading music and it it is going to be both fun and satisfying.</p>",
