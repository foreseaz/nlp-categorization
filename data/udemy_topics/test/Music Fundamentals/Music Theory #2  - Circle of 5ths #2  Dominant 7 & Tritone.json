No dry boring lesson , I feel I'm being taught by how &amp; why it 'works'... and not traditionally rigid like many other course out there. Thumbs up &amp; keep up the good work.</em></p><p><em>****************************************************************************************</em></p><p><strong>Circle of 5ths Level 2 - Intermediate to Advanced</strong></p><p><strong>This course takes musicians to apply more advanced music theory into their playing - Tritones, Tritone Chord Substitutions, Jazzy Chromatic Chord Movement, 36251 Turn Arounds.</strong></p><p>It is important for all musicians, whether you play <strong>guitar, piano, ukulele, violin, harmonica, or any musical instruments</strong> to develop an intimate knowledge of the Circle of 5ths. The Circle of 5ths is a visual picture that tells us the relations between keys, scales, chords, chord progressions, tritones, tritone chord substitutions, pentatonic scales, blues scales, 7 modes of music, etc.</p><p><strong>The Tritone chord substitution</strong> is one of the most commonly used chord substitutions in jazz. By using tritone chord substitution, you often get a beautiful chromatic bass line in the song and especially in turn arounds.</p><p>When it comes to more advanced music theory, students get confused and give up in their struggle to advance in their musicianship.</p><p><strong>Here's the secret:  Learn to use the Moving Circle of 5ths Dynamically</strong>!  When you know how to move the circle around to understand Tritones and how the interval is created in the Dominant 7 chords, you will understand why professional musicians do such smooth voicing because they know how to concentrate on the 3rd &amp; 7th tones easily.</p><p>In this Circle of 5ths Level 2 course, I will show you  how to use the Circle to do Tritone Chord substitutions with Dominant 7 Chords and Minor 7 Chords. In this way, you will have many more options in your music compositions other than the normal Diatonic Chord Progression &amp; Secondary Dominants that you learned in Circle of 5ths Level 1 Course.</p><p>When you do Tritone Chord Substitutions, you begin to learn advance music harmonic sounds, and the importance of doing smooth voicing, chromatic bass line chord movement in turn arounds that audience loves to listen to.</p><p>In this course, I will also show you when Tritone Chord Substitutions work and when they don't work. There are some rules you need to follow so that you create beautiful harmonic sounds in your piece of music, whether reharmonizing a song or in the writing of your own songs.  </p><p>You will be doing a lot of assignments so that <strong>you learn to find the answer yourself</strong>.  What you discover sticks with you much more than what you are told. It is easy for me to lay out all the answers and theory for you. What is unique in the course is that I will coach you along to help you think and discover the answers for yourself in a creative way.</p><p><strong>The following topics will be covered extensively:</strong></p><ol><li>Tritone Chord Substitution</li><li>Tritone Wants to Resolve</li><li>Tritones in All 12 Dominant 7 Chords</li><li>Advanced Harmony: Put in Tritone Chord Substitution</li><li>Two Magical Ways to Find the Tritone Chord Substitutions</li><li>Tritone Chromatic Movement</li><li>Song Application - Little Brown Jug - Putting in Tritone Chord Subs</li><li>When To Avoid Doing Tritone Chord Substitution?</li><li>Improvisation on ii7 V7 I</li><li>Jazzy Turn Around - 3 6 2 5</li><li>Formula for the Jazzy Turn Around 3 6 2 5 in C Key</li><li>Turn Around in Eb Key - Misty</li><li>Improvise on the 3625 Turn Around in all 12 Keys</li><li>Tritone Chord Substitution to Minor 7 Chords</li><li>Minor 7 Chord Substitutions</li><li>Golden Rule of Tritone Chord Subs</li><li>Applying Golden Rule to 36251 Progression</li><li>Apply Tritone Chord Substitutions to E7 A7 D7 G7 C</li><li>Only Need One Circle to Find Tritone Chord Substitutions</li></ol>As you can see, we will be covering a lot of topics so that by the end of the course, you will be able to apply Tritone Chords effortlessly!<p>I'll see you in class,</p><p>Rosa</p><p>========================================================</p><p><strong>Listen to what some of her students are experiencing in her Circle of 5ths Level 1 Course:</strong></p><p><strong>Ivan Bradley</strong></p><p><em>I have been teaching myself to play the ukulele for the past few months but had been struggling to understand which chords went together and why. I was able to play by ear but it was entirely through guesswork. The circle of 5ths really helps you understand how chord progressions work and Rosa's moving version makes so much more sense than a static circle. It's only been a few days since I started the course but I feel that I have a much better understanding of music theory already. Plus Rosa's voice is so pleasant! I really look forward to listening to the videos and playing my ukulele after a long day at work.</em></p><p><strong>Melody Evans</strong></p><p><em>I play guitar, Indian flute, and dulcimer, all by ear. This class is helping me to understand music like I have always wanted to. Don't get me wrong, I love playing by ear; I have just always wanted to also understand music. It is a real time-saver for me when I can refer to my Magic Wheel instead of listening for the note or chord that fits. This has opened up a whole new aspect of music for me. Thank you, thank you.</em></p><p>***************************************************************************<br></p><p><strong>About Rosa's Piano Online Course:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Over </em><strong><em>10,000</em></strong><em> </em><em>very happy students already in my classes</em></li><li><em>See the </em><strong><em>5 Star Reviews</em></strong><em> from VERY satisfied students</em></li><li><em>You get free lifetime access</em></li><li><em>All videos are at your finger tips to watch anytime &amp; anywhere</em></li><li><em>All future extra lectures and upgrades are </em><strong><em>always free</em></strong></li><li><em>Unconditional </em><strong><em>30 day money-back guarantee</em></strong><em> and that's my personal promise to your success!</em></li><li><em>Join this happy family of students </em></li><li><strong><em>Enroll into this course</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><br><em></em></p>",
