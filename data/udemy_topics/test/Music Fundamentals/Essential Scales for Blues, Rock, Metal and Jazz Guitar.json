The best part is that you don't have to wait until you are weeks or months into the course to start applying what you are learning. After just a few short lessons, you will be applying what you are learning to full band jam tracks – or better yet – with your own band.</p><p><strong>Content and Overview</strong></p><p>Suitable for beginner to intermediate guitar players, this course of almost 50 lectures, will take you to the next level – not only in your knowledge of scales but in your playing as a whole. Scales are the foundation of all music and the scales that you will learn in the course are, in our opinion, the most important scales for blues, rock and metal players.</p><p><em><strong>“The practice of scales solves the greatest number of technical problems in the shortest amount of time.”</strong></em><strong> – Andres Segovia</strong></p><p>Beginning with the minor pentatonic scale, we will start learning how to improvise over a chord progression. We will expand our phrasing possibilities with the blues scale before moving on to the natural minor scale.</p><p>With the lectures on the natural minor scale, we will get into a little theory about scales and their relationship to chords. You will be introduced to scale shapes that lend themselves to fast playing that you might hear from guys like Paul Gilbert or John Petrucci.</p><p>The discussions on the harmonic minor and melodic minor scales we will expand our knowledge of scale degrees and their relationship to chords.</p><p>By completing the course, you will shape yourself into another class of player – able to confidently step into any musical situation.</p><p><strong>What am I going to get from this course?</strong></p> <ul><li>Close to 50 lectures (with more coming) covering the 5 essential scales for blues, rock, metal, and jazz</li><li>Downloadable PDF diagrams of all scale patterns</li><li>Downloadable, full-band jam tracks (more to come) to apply your new skills</li><li>Video breakdown of each scale and scale position</li><li>Patterns that can be used for practice or for inclusion in your own solos</li></ul>",
