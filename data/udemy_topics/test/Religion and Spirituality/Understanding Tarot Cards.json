    "description": "<p>This course is about understanding tarot cards - where they come from, what each of the 78 cards mean, and how to do a reading with them for yourself or for others. </p><p>The target audience are those who have an interest in tarot cards and/or the occult and divination.</p><p>The course looks at the history of the tarot, the different types of playing cards available, the difference between the major and minor arcana, what each of the suits mean, how to perform a reading, the warning behind the cards, how to interpret the cards - the position they&#039;re in, whether they&#039;re upright or reversed and when they literally &#039;jump&#039; out at you!</p><p>Some students may have been for a reading before, others may just be curious. You can do readings for others (and charge), but we don&#039;t cover this aspect (making a business of it). Its more for understanding how to do a reading - for yourself and for others. Once your skills increase, there is nothing to stop you from charging for readings.</p><p>We look at example spreads and you have a chance to do a reading yourself. You don&#039;t need to have a set of tarot cards in order to do the course, but once the course is over (if you are to practice your new-found skills), then you will need to get a pack.</p><p>The course will take approx 1-2 hours to complete. We go through each of the card meanings, and then we look at a reading. </p><p>The course is ideal for the curious and for those who just want to &#039;know more&#039; about tarot cards, what each of the cards mean and how to do a reading. The course instructor got her first pack of cards over 20 years ago, and over the years, she&#039;s learned the meaning of the cards from person experience. She believes that the cards &quot;never lie&quot;.<br style=\"\"></p><p><br style=\"\"></p>",
