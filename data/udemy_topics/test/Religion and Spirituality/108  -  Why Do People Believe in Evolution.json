    "description": "In this class, we continue the Created or Evolved series. We will examine the reasons why people believe in Evolution. Are there scientific reasons to support evolution? Or is it blind faith? We will look at so called vestigial organs, the &quot;Biogenic Law&quot;, and whether all forms of life have gill slits as embryos. Are these solid pieces of proof for evolution? Are there consequences to a society that embraces Evolution? You will be able to examine the logic and evidence for yourself and be able to determine which position is the most plausible.  &lt;/p&gt;",
