    "description": "<p>  \t  This course is about the Big Picture, the Big Questions, and Living a Life That Matters. It&#039;s about discovering how we are from a cosmic perspective, how are all connected to a larger universe, and how we can discover and align ourselves with the dynamics of the cosmos in our everyday lives. We&#039;ll also tackle big topics such as life, death, and spirituality and their role in our lives.  </p>  <p>  \t  Imagine going forward into the world each day, knowing that you are part of something much larger than yourself. Imagine how your relationships might transform if you recognized that the forces drawing you to your partner are the very same forces that shaped the galaxies, created the stars, and formed the molten Earth? Imagine what you could achieve in your life, knowing that you had 13.8 billion years of cosmic history and the forces of the universe behind you? Imagine how your life would transform once you saw yourself and your life as part of a much larger pattern of cosmic proportions and meaning?  </p>  <p>  \t  These and other questions will be explored in this series of short but impactful and richly illustrated lectures on our place in the cosmos and our relationship to it. Each lecture will be accompanied by a downloadable transcript of the material as well as follow-up questions to consider for further reflection and insight. The course is self-paced, and participants are welcome to explore in an afternoon, or over the course of several weeks or months. Once you enroll in the course, you&#039;ll have permanent ongoing access to the course and its materials, allowing you to revisit any aspect of it when desired or needed.  </p>  <p>  \t  Anyone interested in living a spiritually-informed life aligned with the dynamics of the evolving cosmos will find a rich experience in taking this course. Whether you take this course as an individual or as part of a study group, you&#039;ll have food for thought for years to come.  </p>",
