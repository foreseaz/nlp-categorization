    "description": "<p>  \tThe course gives the understanding and knowledge of how to clear and unblock Chakras with music.  It is set up in a simple and basic method.  The first section gives background on the musical tones used, the mantras, vowels, colors, symbols and other associations with each of the Chakras.  </p>  <p>  \tThe second section is a Charka per lecture.  The lecture is set up with narration with the color and symbol of each Chakra.  Students will be guided by listening to the music for each Chakra while viewing the color and symbol.  Students have the option to sing the mantra and vowel along with the video.  </p>  <p>  \tStudents have the mp3 download of each of the music that they can use in the future in an mp3 player, tablet, smart phone or computer.  Music is provided with both the vocals and instrumental only so that students have the option to work with either recordings.  </p>  <p>  \tThis is an outstanding course to gain knowledge of the healing powers of music and how Charkas work.  </p>",
