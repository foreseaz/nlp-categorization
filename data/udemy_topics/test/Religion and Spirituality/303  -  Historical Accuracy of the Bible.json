We will examine the evidence that supports the Bible&#039;s historicity. We will look at several significant events. Did the events of Exodus really happen? Was King David really the king of Israel or a mythical figure? Are there extra-biblical sources for the life and death of Jesus Christ? We will examine all these event and more and we invite you to examine the evidence for yourself.</p>",
