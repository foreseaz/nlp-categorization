    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    This course introduces learners to the three levels of meditation, focusing on the 3rd level, which is rarely taught or explained. Progressing from definitions and explanations to actual exercises, students can expect to gain an understanding of the difference between concentration and meditation, choosing the right &quot;object&quot; of meditation, and how to actually redirect attention to perform internal meditation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMeditation in its various forms can have many benefits, from physical health to mental relaxation and well-being; at its core, however, meditation is a tool to bring us to our true Selves. This course will look beyond common conceptions of yoga to that true spiritual practice.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis is a great course for anyone who has been seeking a deeper spiritual understanding and wants to go beyond external practices, such as breathing exercises and mantra.  </p>",
