    "description": "<p>There’s no  magic to seeing what the future holds. Now, you can give and receive immediate  and specific answers about romance, money, and career. You can predict the  future using an item found in virtually every household--an ordinary deck of  playing cards. <strong><em>Your Future Is In The Cards: Become a Fortune Teller in 7 Days</em></strong>  demystifies the art of fortune-telling and delivers a step-by-step system of  interpreting playing cards at a professional level. This crash course teaches you everything you need to know to begin a  fortune telling with playing cards and giving accurate and detailed readings in  just one week.</p>    <p><strong>The Method</strong></p>    <p>This course takes an  analytical approach to cartomancy which means you’ll learn to read the cards  using a logical, step-by-step process. Specific meanings are assigned based on card numbers, suits  and even suit colors (red or black), creating a commonsense method that is easy  to apply. Each card has a basic meaning but you will find new associations for  the cards as you work with them. And, as you progress, your intuition will fill  in the gaps. Through your readings, you will help yourself and your clients:</p>    <p>·  Perceive the present more clearly</p>    <p>·  Understand hidden influences</p>    <p>·  Uncover blocks and obstacles</p>    <p>·  Find solutions</p>    <p>·  See how the future may unfold</p>    <p><strong>What You Will Learn in this Course </strong></p>    <p>First, you  get the basics, which means understanding the parts of a standard playing card  deck, guidelines for cartomancers, and learning to shuffle and select cards.  Next, you’ll learn what each card represents. Then, you’ll discover new techniques to gain more  information from the cards to add important details to your readings in this playing card reading course. </p>    <p>Masterfully,  you will learn to pull precise details from the cards revealing physical  descriptions (“Your future romantic partner has a dark complexion--perhaps of  African American, Latin, East Indian, heritage. He’s stocky in build and he has  facial hair”), and timing of events (“A job offer will be presented in the 2nd  week of spring”).</p>    <p>Take this course and  become a fortune teller in 7 days!</p>",
