    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    In this 31 lecture course, we continue the Created or Evolved Class. We will be talking about one of the most important and perhaps most controversial questions of all time. How old is the Earth? We invite everyone to come examine the evidence themselves. By the end of this course you will be able to answer the following questions. What is the Biblical view on the age of the Earth? Is the Earth young or billions of years old? Is there valid evidence for a young Earth? Does it even matter what you believe about the age of the Earth? All of these questions and more will be discussed in this series of video lectures.  </p>",
