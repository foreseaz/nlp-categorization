    "description": "<p>This course is about blending Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra. In this course Yoga refers to its traditional meaning as a path of meditation and contemplation leading to Self-realization. Your guide in the course is Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati (Swami J for short), along with Swami Ma Tripurashakti Bharati (Ma Tri) who has done the creative design of the course. Most of the course is video lectures, complemented by several extensive PDF files. Whether you are a student of Yoga or a Teacher, or both, this course will lead you to a greater depth in your personal practices, as well as a more refined skill in teaching or sharing with others. The course is designed in four major sections: One each for Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra, and then a section on integrating the three. The course is designed so that you can comfortably move through the lessons at whatever pace you wish, completing the lectures in as little as 4-5 hours. However, we encourage you to go back through all of the lectures and articles, whether starting over from the beginning and going to the end, or just surfing around the lectures in you repeat views. There is a great deal of practical information here on practices of meditation and contemplation, and while the explanations are in reasonably simple language, you will probably uncover the depth by repeated reviews. The people we have had in mind in creating this course are those who already have some exposure to one or more of the three of Yoga, Vedanta, or Tantra, and would like to expand your practices in a traditional way. Welcome. Enjoy the courseâ€¦.</p>",
