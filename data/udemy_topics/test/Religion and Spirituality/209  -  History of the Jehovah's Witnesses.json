We will discuss who the founder was, when they were first founded, and the important events in their timeline. We will examine each of these in depth and begin to build a foundation that will help you be able to determine whether the teachings of this religion are trustworthy. Some of the questions we will examine include:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>Was the founder trustworthy?</li><li>Was he a good moral example?</li><li>Was he consistent in his teaching?</li></ul><p><span></span>Answering these questions for yourself is critical in being able to determine whether or not a religion is most likely true. </p><p>We hope this course will inspire you to continue to explore world religions and ignite a passion to search for the truth.</p>",
