    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course is an<strong style=\"\"> introduction to Buddhism</strong>. I became very interested in Buddhism while living in Vietnam for over five years from 2007 to 2012. While Buddhism is by definition a religion, in actual practice it resembles philosophy and psychology more than religion if we go by Buddha&#039;s actual teachings.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Buddhism is essentially <strong style=\"\">a set of tools</strong> developed over thousands of years in India, China, Japan and throughout Asia. These tools are more applicable now than ever before as we grapple with the anxiety that has become typical in modern life.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  This course will introduce to you what Buddhism is,<strong style=\"\"> how it can help you</strong> develop <strong style=\"\">happiness, contentment, equanimity, peace, and love</strong> so that you can deal with modern challenges effectively, and generally<strong style=\"\"> enrich your experience</strong> as a human being.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  I have now spent thousands of hours studying Buddhism, meditating, and speaking with monks at Pagodas and Monasteries throughout Vietnam and South East Asia. Since I am an American, I feel that I am in a unique position to communicate the essence of Buddhism and it&#039;s teachings to a western audience as very few people can.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In addition, I am trained as a teacher, with a <strong style=\"\">teaching certificate</strong> from the University of Idaho as well as a <strong style=\"\">master&#039;s degree in curriculum and instruction</strong> from the same school. So I am confident that students will leave my course with a solid understanding not only of what Buddhism is, but <strong style=\"\">HOW</strong> it can help you to improve yourself and change your life for the better.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Join my course, and let these ancient strategies help you deal with modern challenges. They&#039;ve lasted this long because they work!  </p>",
