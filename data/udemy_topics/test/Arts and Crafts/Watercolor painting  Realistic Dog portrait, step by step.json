Yana is an amazing artist, and I feel very grateful that she shares her skills with me as a student. She is engaging, soft spoken, and keeping the listener interested until the last second. Doing this course really made me feel like I too can draw anything I want. I recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn how to make beautiful drawings!</em></p><p><em>***</em></p><p><br>I'll create a <strong>realistic dog </strong>portrait explaining every single step and sharing my vision with you on paint mixing and color building. I'll explain every single step I've taken and why. You'll learn how to create incredibly realistic eyes, how to paint fur, how to create volume and how to make our artwork alive. You will paint along with me during the entire course. And of course you're absolutely free to experiment, try your own thing following your heart and see what happens.</p><p>Everybody can paint and you <strong>don't need a school</strong> to start doing it! I will not bother you with boring school theory, we will start from the scratch and paint an awesome dog together. All you need is a desire, true interest and some patience. Because everything you create is your personal experience and it can't be \"wrong\". You don’t need someone to give you an assignment. As long as you follow your own vision and enjoy the process, that's all that matters.<span></span><br></p><p>I'll provide the reference photo I'm using. Feel free to use your own style of materials and <strong>ask me any questions </strong>you might have in discussion.<br></p><p>When you buy the course, you'll receive <strong>lifetime access. </strong>Most importantly, you'll have a <strong>30 day money back guarantee</strong> (no questions asked).<br>So what are you waiting for? </p><p>Follow your passion, take a brush and go ahead ;)<br><br><br></p><p><span></span></p>",
