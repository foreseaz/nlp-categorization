This will be followed by learning how to cast on, the knit and purl stitches and finally how to bind off. Included in the course materials is the pattern you will need to follow along.  The course is designed to be followed chronologically, so that each lesson builds upon the information from the previous lesson.  A combination of videos and slideshows are included to show step by step procedures as well as the demonstrations in real time. Two methods for knitting are taught, English and Continental; finally binding off and finishing will show you how to complete your project. Upon completing the course, you will have knitted a scarf of your own!  You will also now be able to move on to bigger projects and more complex patterns, you will have all the fundamental knowledge and skills to become a knitter for life.  </p>",
