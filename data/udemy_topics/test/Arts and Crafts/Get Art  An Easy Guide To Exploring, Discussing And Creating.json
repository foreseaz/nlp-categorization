The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.&quot; </strong></em>(Pablo Picasso)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This is a course that will hopefully help you look for something new. I built it for people who forgot how important art is - and for those who think they can&#039;t afford enjoying works of art. I built it for people who think that art is for someone else.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    It&#039;s not, and you&#039;re missing out on a huge portion of a good life. This series of lectures will show you how to start getting it back.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">“If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our  imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in  nothing and having worthless dreams.” </strong></em>(Yann Martel, <em style=\"\">Life of Pi</em>)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    You deserve to be around art. You deserve to be moved, inspired, refreshed by it. You are entitled to speak about it, be curious about it, criticize and learn about it. It was not made for art historians or critics with PhDs. It was made for you to enjoy, explore and share.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This course shows you how to get back to the art you deserve. It shows you how to find it around you, how to talk about it without embarrassment or confusion, and how to start using it to boost your own creativity.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">“Art is what you can get away with.” </strong></em>(Andy Warhol)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This is not a high-brow art appreciation course. Nobody enjoys those. This is a course based on simple rules and behaviour that comes easily. If you&#039;re curious, fun-loving and keen to experience something more than the 9-to-5 drudgery, then you&#039;ve got what it takes to benefit from this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    There will be practical use to everything you work with: each session ends with a project that you can complete to see instant results from your work here.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">“In a world of disorder and disaster and fraud, sometimes only beauty  can be trusted.  Only artistic excellence is incorruptible.  Pleasure  cannot be bargained down.&quot; </strong></em>(Elizabeth Gilbert, <em style=\"\">Eat, Pray, Love</em>)  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Join us and find out what you&#039;ve been missing.  </p>",
