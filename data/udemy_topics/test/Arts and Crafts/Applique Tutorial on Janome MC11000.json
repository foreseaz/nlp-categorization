    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t   This course has been adapted from a in-house live training session delivered on a regular basis for students attending Geraldine’s Studio in Melbourne, Australia.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   In this course you will learn how to do applique in the hoop, without actually placing the fabric in the hoop, using any Janome embroidery machine, including the MC350e, MC11000, MC12000 and MC15000.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The techniques demonstrated within this course can be applied to any brand of Embroidery Machine but the designs will need to be converted for that particular brand of machine.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The minimum hoop size required to stitch out the designs included in the course is 5” x7”.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The designs used to create the teddy and the blocks on the blanket are available for download to all students and are supplied in “JEF” format.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   All included designs have been created and digitised by Geraldine and are supplied for your own personal use and cannot be distributed or sold with prior permission.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   The course will take approximately 1 hour to complete but can be viewed at your own pace and revisited at any time for review.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   It contains a featured furry Ted-E-Bear with a unique sculptured look surrounded by 4 tumbling blocks depicting the word “BABY”, with a 2 1/2” border using the same fabric as that used for the backing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   This is a watch over my shoulder course where you will see me complete each task and then follow by example.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   I will demonstrate how to use printed templates to get precise placement of your design so you can be assured that the designs end up exactly where you expect them to.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   You will also learn how to finish the blanket with perfect mitred corners, giving you a professional finish to be proud of.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If you’re an embroidery enthusiast, this course will expand your skills while creating a fun blanket and Ted-E-Bear that any child would love to hug and cuddle.  </p>",
