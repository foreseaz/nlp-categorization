    "description": "<p>  \t  Professional Pearl and Bead Stringing is for goldsmiths, jewelry designers and serious amateurs who want or need to learn how to string pearls and gemstones professionally. The course begins with the easiest techniques and builds on them to demonstrate the more difficult skills, trying knots between beads and attaching a clasp to a strand.  </p>  <p>  \t  Students are introduced to critical jewelry manufacturing concepts in this niche including design versus manufacturing trade-offs, available materials, commercial findings and more.  </p>  <p>  \t  A lecture on pearls is included since students will undoubtedly be working with this gemstone and will need to answer commonly asked questions from clients.  </p>  <p>  \t  Upon completion, the student will have completed three necklaces using different techniques.  </p>  <p>  \t Whether the student decides to monetize his or her new skills or to use them to make jewelry for personal use, this is a life-changing course, the beginning of a hugely rewarding and creative journey that will last a lifetime.  </p>",
