I've been there many times too and its not your fault.  </p>  <p>  \t                   There are tons of free videos out there on youtube and other sites that \"SHOW\" you how to draw but they usually are just super sped of videos with no explanations or reasons.  You've probably also  seen the ones that show you how to draw celebrities line by line and speed thru the shading , but you and I both know that in the end those really aren't helping you develop the skills you need to really draw what ever you want.  </p>  <p>  \t                   They're just fragments here and there of what you need to know, not a step by step roadmap and approach of how to get there with quality instruction.  </p>  <p>  \t                   Truly mastering drawing is about learning and putting into action some fundamental concepts and techniques that anyone can learn and use to render amazing results ever time. Once you learn them, you have the ability to draw whatever you want and that includes shading your own drawings like a badass not just watching some other artist show off their skills.  </p><p><strong>GAURENTEE</strong></p><p>If you are not completely satisfied no risk to you. Simply request a refund and there is no harm no foul. I know that once you get in and start using the techniques your drawings will immediately improve just like the hundreds of others that have already taken the course.</p>",
