    "description": "<p>  \t    Have you ever wanted to bring your ideas to life in clay but werenâ€™t sure where to start?  This class will give you the skills needed to start creating your own original sculptures using Super Sculpey.  We will start from the ground up, beginning with concept creation moving into armatures, building up clay, creating detail and texture, and finally, painting.  At the end of the class, you will have a completed sculpture of your own.  </p>  <p>  \t     Students will need to purchase materials in order to complete this class.  Materials list and recommended buying locations will be provided.  </p>  <p>  \t    Previous sculpting experience is not necessary.  However, at least some working knowledge of art basics (form, shape, color theory, etc.) as well as basic drawing skills are highly recommended.  </p>",
