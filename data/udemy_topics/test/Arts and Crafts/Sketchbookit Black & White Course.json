You will have a collaged front cover for your sketchbook, a creative front page and 4 pages of drawing in a range of media and techniques. The theme for this course is 'The Sea', and as well as learning all about drawing, you will also be shown how to present all the pages, resulting in a stunningly beautiful collection of art work.</p>\n\n<p>This course is suitable for students who are 9 years and over and is also suitable for any adults wishing to learn about, or improve their, drawing skills.
