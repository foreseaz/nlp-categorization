By that I mean it is unlikely I will add any further information, it is therefore priced accordingly. This portfolio of paintings gives you the opportunity to choose a picture you like and learn as you paint.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why you might choose this picture</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*If you are looking to take your watercolour painting to the next level, this is for you.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*If you want to challenge yourself, step outside your comfort zone and add impact to your watercolour painting then look no further.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*If you want to feel more confident using strong dark pigments, get started now.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*If you want to work more loosely, use more water, use stronger pigments, you'll love this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let your watercolour painting talent blossom as you enjoy over two hours of<strong> LIVE ART</strong> that you can watch again, and again, and again. Just stand next to me as we chat about the picture, the colours and the techniques. It's all here.</p>\n\n<p>Take what you learn here to other projects and expand your new found skills and excitement, letting your energy show in your work.</p>\n\n<p>Each lecture explains simply every step of the way. I'm there to help you solve problems before you get to them and to help you discover more dynamic ways to paint with watercolours.</p>",
