    "description": "<p>Watercolor is a technique that you can have a lot of fun with and that can even surprise you, because there are many elements that have a life of their own. </p><p><span></span>But with Watercolor, there is no going back, i.e. you can´t make any changes. It is also a very fast technique, and we have to improvise a lot. That´s why you have to learn to master it from the beginning, so you can later work more easily and skillfully. </p><p><span></span><strong style=\"\">How can we learn to paint in watercolor? </strong></p><p><span></span>I think it takes practice to master it, and it can´t be achieved by painting just one picture. That&#039;s why I´ve given myself the challenge of creating a course that really teaches you how using a series of exercises that increase in difficulty and explore all technical aspects of watercolor, putting them into practice, and learning to control them from zero.</p><p><strong style=\"\">The Course</strong></p><p>In this course, <strong style=\"\">we will learn to paint in watercolor </strong>using:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>one color</li><li>one brush</li><li>and one type of paper.</li></ul><p>With these materials, we will do <strong style=\"\">7 exercises looking at different types of light,</strong> i.e., direct light, indirect light, shine and backlighting; To do so, we will use a basic shape that is &quot;the egg&quot; as it is a simple form that will allow us to really focus on watercolor techniques without being distracted by other issues and so we can really learn to gain control and master it.</p><p>I hope you like the course, you learn a lot, have fun and enjoy.</p>",
