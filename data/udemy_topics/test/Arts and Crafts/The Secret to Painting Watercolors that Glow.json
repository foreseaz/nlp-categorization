    "description": "<p>  \t  This course is designed for students who want to learn how to paint bold, glowing watercolor paintings.<br></p>  <p>  \t  I will show you step-by-step how I achieve deep, vibrant colors through glazing, as well as various other techniques including scrubbing and lifting, color mixing, visual harmony, and achieving realistic colors.</p><p>By the end of the course, you will be able to:</p><ul><li>Use the right color combinations to make your subject stand out.</li><li>Create a quick and richly colored background without masking.</li><li>Glaze multiple layers of colors to create a rich and realistic effect.</li><li>Effectively \"paint\" with plain water.</li><li>Mix your own luminous grays, greens, and oranges (notoriously tricky to get right!)</li><li>Fix minor problems such as blooms easily.</li><li>Glaze and lift repeatedly until you are satisfied with the resulting color.</li></ul>  <p>  \t  I will paint a yellow rose from start to finish in 13 video lessons, and will provide you with a list of recommended materials, PLUS a printable outline of this rose so you can easily follow along.  </p><p>The concepts I teach can be applied to anything--landscapes, still-life, figures--whatever your preferred painting subject, these techniques can improve your paintings.<br></p>  <p>  \t  This course can be taken by anyone interested in watercolor painting, from beginner to expert, however, if you want to learn how to paint a quick, loose watercolor, then this course is not for you: My methods require patience and multiple steps to achieve this glowing effect.</p><p>If you find this is not the course for you, I offer a 30-day money back guarantee, no questions asked.<br></p>  <p>  \t  This painting class contains videos of me doing the actual painting and I break down the process simply and easily. At the end is a video recap of each lesson with the techniques and colors used, for easy and quick reference.</p>    <p>  \t  <br></p>  <p>  \t  <br></p>",
