    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      Interviewing is carried out on a frequent basis across the globe. Investigative interviewing is the narrower band of criminal &amp; disciplinary enquiry although it still connects with the fundamental process of speaking to people.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Often steeped in mystery and conjecture the thought of conducting such a process fills many with fear and trepidation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This entry level course provides the practical tools to enable you to confidently conduct an investigatory interview with both witnesses and those individuals that may have contravened your organisations disciplinary code or are subject of a grievance and reach a decision that is both fair and lawful.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      Used widely across the business community and the public sector the same elements have been adopted by the UK Police.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   Ian Kirke is the Managing Director of leading UK Risk Consultants TFS (www.tfsuccess.com).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      &quot;TFS is providing Hertfordshire with a bespoke &quot;out-of-custody&quot;  interview package to enable us to train all our uniformed response and  neighbourhood officers. This training is providing officers with skills  in recognising when out-of-custody interviews should be staged, how to  stage such an interview,  interviewing both cooperative and  non-cooperative suspects, and dealing confidently with legal  representatives; all in all professionalising and adding a consistency  to out-of-custody interviewing in Herts.”  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Shane O&#039;Neill, Detective Chief Inspector, Hertfordshire Constabulary</strong></em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What others have to say:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  “As an experienced LP professional I believe that that the TFS approach to interviewing is like a breath of fresh air. The process driven methodology provides a practical framework that can be used to match all investigatory outcomes from low level disciplinary &amp; grievance procedures to complex criminal investigations. An invaluable tool providing a significant ROI for investigators, especially those with limited experience, I highly recommend the programme.”  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Gary Tattersall, Group Risk Manager, Jack Wills</strong></em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  “As an experienced investigator working within an ever changing company, time considered for investigations has always proven to be limited. The TFS investigation and interview techniques offer a structured process that is easy to follow, quick to prepare and gets the results required whilst demonstrating a clear understanding of investigations in business and knowledge of employment law. I also liked the approach to the training, particularly with the role-play exercises, it makes it go beyond just theory.”  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Leyton, Morgan Head of Business Protection at Sally Salon Services</strong></em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"> Some of the best bits:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"> How to manage different personalities presented: Liar, truth, silence, mixture, etc. Tested repeatedly via Employment Tribunals </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">G.D, Space.UK</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"> Knowing that failure to obtain an admission is not the end of the line </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">S.D, JD Sports</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"> Confidence in doing the right thing practically and legally</em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\"> O.C, Sainsbury’s Supermarkets</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong></em><em style=\"\">Applying a consistent model to unique situations </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">A.H, Waitrose</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">Flow chart system </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">OC, TSS</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">Fantastic structured way / process to investigate </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">TP, Tesco</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">5 WH, flowchart of events </em><strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">MB, Selco</em></strong>  </p>",
