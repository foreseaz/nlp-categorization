In this course, renowned expert Dr. Ron Terry will review the history of reservoir engineering, define key terms, carefully introduce the material balance approach, and show how to apply it with many types of reservoirs.</p><p style=\"\">Next, they introduce key principles of fluid flow, water influx, and advanced recovery (including hydraulic fracturing). Throughout, they present field examples demonstrating the use of material balance and history matching to predict reservoir performance. For the first time, this edition relies on Microsoft Excel with VBA to make calculations easier and more intuitive.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Content and Overview </strong>  The first two sections are designed to bring beginners up to speed with an introduction to reservoir engineering and a review of rock and fluid properties. More experienced students jump in in section three to learn the material balance equation and learn how to apply it in all four reservoir types. The course is rounded out with a thorough review of Darcy&#039;s law, enhanced oil recovery, well testing and history matching.</p><p style=\"\">Throughout the course, we cover example problems and assign homework problems. We provide a video walking through the solution of those homework problems as well. The course culminates in the history matching problem which incorporates the concepts from each chapter. </p><p style=\"\">Students completing the course will have the knowledge and tools to analyze well performance and manage petroleum reservoirs.</p>",
