In addition, and most important, how to market and publicize. It&#039;s one thing to have a CD and it&#039;s another thing to have a CD sold. I&#039;ve been working in the media and profiled by the media since 1998. My initial business has to do with authors and book publishing. I&#039;ve coached authors and musicians how to present their worthiness and value to the general public. The media is the bull horn that is on top of the soapbox to tell your story. You need the media. In this class, we&#039;ll talk about things beyond the recording studio. Remember, it&#039;s one thing to have a CD and it&#039;s a totally different thing to have someone buy it.</span><br style=\"\"></p>",
