    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is designed with a hands-on approach. We feel the best way to learn how to edit in Lightroom is to follow along with the process yourself. However every other course we could find online shows you techniques but gives you no way to practice them. That&#039;s why we put together a professional styled shoot so we can <strong style=\"\">PROVIDE YOU WITH ACTUAL RAW IMAGES! </strong>These images are still under our copyright, meaning they are for tutorial purposes only but they will give you a chance to practice on real professional RAW photographs and produce the same results that you see in the tutorials.</p><p style=\"\">We use VSCO(Visual Supply Co.) film in this course because it allows us to translate our digital RAW data into color profiles that are then able to be edited. In short this is not a pack of &quot;film look-a-like presets&quot; but rather digital film stocks that translate your image data into film. This is only the very first step, in this course we <strong style=\"\">take you much farther than simple presets</strong> teaching you to develop an eye for beautiful skin tones which are the very cornerstone of good portrait and wedding photographs. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What cameras does this course work for?</strong></p><p style=\"\">The raw images provided in this course are from <strong style=\"\">Canon</strong> 5d Mark III cameras but once you have learned the methods we teach they can be easily applied to <strong style=\"\">Nikon</strong>, Fuji, Leica, Olympus, or Sony images as these are all supported by Lightroom and VSCO film. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">What will you learn?</strong></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">How to install VSCO film to be used with Lightroom</li><li style=\"\">How to import photos into your Lightroom catalog with ease</li><li style=\"\">How to rate your images which is also known as culling</li><li style=\"\">How to select a good starting preset for an image</li><li style=\"\">How to tone an image based on the subjects skin</li><li style=\"\">How to make custom adjustments</li><li style=\"\">How to retouch skin imperfections with the healing spot removal tool</li><li style=\"\">How to refine an image with sharpening &amp; grain</li><li style=\"\">How to use virtual copies to develop your personal style</li><li style=\"\">How to make a personal preset for batch processing</li><li style=\"\">How to fix lens warping with lens corrections</li><li style=\"\">How to remove foreground objects with the clone tool</li><li style=\"\">How to crop or re-align images</li><li style=\"\">Bonus: How to make a tilt-shift effect by sending an image to Photoshop</li><li style=\"\">How to export images for print or web!</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">How will these skills help you?</strong></p><p style=\"\">Everything we will be teaching you in this course is the result of many years of practicing and tweaking our process to develop compelling images.
