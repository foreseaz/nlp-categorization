Period.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Andrei Parabellum</strong> - me :) , Russian internet marketing champion, father of infobusiness in Russia and a Guinnes book of records holder for world's largest webinar <em>(over 97,000 people signed up and over 12,000 were present from the beginning to the very end)</em>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Dr. Tom Orent</strong>, the recognized leader in building strong, profitable <u>dental </u>practices  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Ron LeGrand</strong>, the “grandfather” of the independent<u>real estate</u> investor movement  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Bill Gough</strong>, the leading marketing coach to the Allstate® <u>insurance</u> agent community  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Craig Simpson</strong>, author of ‘The Direct Mail Solution’, and the go-to guy on<u>direct-mail</u> lists  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Steve Adams</strong>, operator of 21 exceptionally successful <u>retail</u> stores, author, publisher  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Jim Cavale &amp; Forrest Walden</strong>, <u>franchisors</u> of Iron Tribe Fitness  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Ben Glass</strong>, Great Legal Marketing, helping <u>attorneys</u> differentiate themselves in crowded, cluttered marketplaces with superior, information-based marketing  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Curtis Dawn</strong>, <u>home-based business</u> expert  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Mike Crow</strong>, leader of a nationwide network of <u>home inspectors</u>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Ron &amp; Jill Wolforth</strong>, coaching exceptionally talented young <u>baseball players and parents</u>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Andy Mackensen</strong>, innovative developer/f<u>ranchisor</u> of “healthy vending” for schools, stores, gyms  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Robin Robbins</strong>, #1 technology/IT business marketing advisor  - <u>B2B marketing</u> expert  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Donna Krech</strong>, provider of complete marketing and business development systems, primarily in women focused <u>health and wellness</u> businesses  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Lillian Too</strong>, publisher, online media publisher and event promoter of the #1 international celebrity-author in <u>Feng Shui</u>, and of other leading experts  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Keith Lee</strong>, <u>management</u> systems coach – for hiring, training, managing and motivating high performance teams  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Richard James</strong>, business/marketing <u>automation</u> specialist with emphasis on fully monetizing unconverted leads  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Adams Hudson</strong>, <u>newsletter marketing</u> expert; publisher of exclusive customer newsletters for operators of heating/air conditioning and other home services businesses  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Nelson Searcy</strong>, #1 coach to <u>senior pastors and church leaders</u>, on launching and growing successful churches  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t <strong>Chauncey Hutter Jr.</strong>, leading marketing advisor to the <u>tax preparation industry</u></p><p><br><u></u>  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t <strong>These “one liners” definitely do NOT do these folks justice.</strong> Getting to brainstorm and share experiences with this bunch has been worth a fortune to me – and you getting to eavesdrop on our high speed, high level mastermind-style discussion of ‘best strategies’ can be worth a fortune to you, too.  </p>  <p>  \t   And look at the <strong>INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY</strong> reflected in this roster – combined, these thought-leaders influence well over 1,000,000 entrepreneurs, professionals, retailers, service business operators, even pastors every year. You can’t find a type of business or moneymaking activity left untouched by this “league of extraordinary entrepreneurs”!  Most, by the way, even have more than one business. <strong>Their experience is RICH. Their curiosity BOUNDLESS. Their invention and innovation BOLD. Their ability to IDENTIFY HIDDEN OPPORTUNITIES for you, UNRIVALED.</strong> And, of course, they and this discussion are led by none other than Dan Kennedy, who has more than 20 years’ experience leading these kinds of groups and in drawing the best out of them. When you “step into THIS roundtable discussion, in THIS room”, you enter <strong>a unique powerhouse of critical and dynamic thinking devoted to one central, shared purpose: MAKING MONEY! – and helping and coaching others in doing the same</strong>. We are all about RESULTS that matter, that strengthen, that improve great business enterprises and their good service to others.  </p>  <p>  \t   By the way, it requires about $35,000.00 and a certain level of success to be permitted to be in this group. But for us, the “time cost” is much more significant, as we must leave our homes and businesses and travel to Dan’s home-base, Cleveland, Ohio, three times a year and “camp out” and really WORK, long hours, too. We work on each others’ businesses. We work at mastermind-style problem-solving, opportunity-finding, and money-making.  </p>  <p>  \t <strong><br><u></u></strong></p><p><strong><u>For your benefit</u>, we invested an extra day, to participate in this special roundtable discussion of ‘Our Best Strategies’, recorded live</strong>. Each person in the group would bill their time for a consulting or coaching day at $10,000.00, $15,000.00, $20,000.00, some more – so were you to collect them and helm this same ‘Best Strategies’ discussion for yourself, it would easily cost you $200,000.00 to $400,000.00. I’m happy to tell you, I will hand it over to you “on a silver platter”, for a whole lot less!  </p>  <p>  \t   I can<u>not</u> imagine your curiosity about our wide-ranging, spontaneous ‘best strategies’ roundtable failing you or me. So, now is the time to get these mind-blowing audio recordings (raw and unedited!) along with printed, edited transcripts ready for your yellow hi-liter pen and margin notes and corner-folding, to mark the action items you will convert to cash!  </p>",
