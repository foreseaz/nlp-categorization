I aim to deliver the necessary skills as fast as possible. I've been so annoyed at all of the courses I come across with countless hours of regurgitated nonsense and slow speaking instructors. You aren't paying me for the length of my content, only for the value that it delivers, and that value comes from taking action. So this is the course you take to learn the skills quickly and jump into action.***</strong></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>I am available for any questions and will respond promptly. However, please know that with these lessons, I do expect students to have some basic knowledge of Instagram.</ul>",
