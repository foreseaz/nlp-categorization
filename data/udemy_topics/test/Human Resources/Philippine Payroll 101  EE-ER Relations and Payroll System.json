Worst, not complying with the rules and regulations<strong> causes penalties for violations</strong> and sometimes <strong>progresses to Labor arbitration hearing or law suits</strong>, which <strong>consumes more money, time and energy</strong>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence,<strong> Philippine Payroll 101 series courses</strong> are created with the<strong> aim to give employers and employees working knowledge or understanding</strong> <strong>on various Philippine Rules &amp; Regulations of DOLE, SSS, Phil-Health, Pag-ibig and BIR concerning Payroll Computation.</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Philippine Payroll 101 Courses, related topics of similar nature are grouped accordingly as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>EE-ER Relations and Payroll System </li><li>Time Concepts (What To Know)</li><li>EE Earnings and Benefits </li><li>EE Deductions and Remittance Dues</li><li>Records and Internal Control</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These Philippine Payroll 101 courses are <u>independent</u> on its own and interdependent with one another.
