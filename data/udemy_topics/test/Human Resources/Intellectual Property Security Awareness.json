Robbing someone of their creative expression is a crime that can lead to million dollar fines and jail time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Welcome to the world of intellectual property, where using someone else’s trademark, patent, copyright or trade secret can land you in court for counterfeiting, criminal copyright infringement and theft.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In this course, you&#039;ll learn what intellectual property is, so you can share it wisely, when it’s OK to use protected works without the owners permission, how to determine what’s safe to share, and what’s too risky, who really owns your Linkedin connections and Twitter account, why accessing someone else’s social media account -- even with their permission -- could be a crime and much, much more.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Before you or your coworkers accidentally infringe on the rights of a litigious intellectual property owner, get this action class right now and learn how to demonstrate respect for intellectual property on social media.  </p>",
