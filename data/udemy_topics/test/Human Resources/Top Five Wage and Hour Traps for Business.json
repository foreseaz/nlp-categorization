    "description": "<p>This course is about how we pay employees.  It is intended for business owners, operations managers, and human resource professionals that are involved with making critical decisions regarding whether and how much to pay employees.  This course is beginner/intermediate level with an emphasis on highlighting common problems that typically create liability for the business.  </p><p>No special materials are required for this course, which will include lectures and handouts describing important information concerning best practices in paying employees.  The course is structured to provide extensive discussion and guidance on avoiding the top five wage and hour traps that businesses frequently experience.</p><p>  \t        The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 governs most of the employee pay practices in the United States.  However, most of the applicable legal landscape is tenuously evolving. Furthermore, managers are frequently unsure of their specific payroll responsibilities and create liability for the organization.  We will review developing regulatory activities that will continue to shape the legal landscape surrounding employment pay practices in the workplace for many years to come. In the meantime, employers need to assure managers are properly trained and understand the basics of wage and hour law.  </p>  <p>  \t        Besides identifying the five most common traps that ensnare employers regarding payroll practices, we will also discuss regulatory enforcement activities that help employers understand and mitigate legal liability.  This will include, the latest legal developments e.g. pending changes to the overtime exemption regulations.  </p>",
