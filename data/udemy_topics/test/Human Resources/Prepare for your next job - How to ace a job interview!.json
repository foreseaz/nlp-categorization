On so many occasions I have seen the well prepared &#039;B&#039; Grade Candidate beat the unprepared &#039;A&#039; Grade Candidate.  </p><p style=\"\">How to ACE the Interview comprises 15 short videos that break down the process, how to prepare, what goes wrong, and what to do to maximize your chance of getting the job.  I will take about 2 hours to complete and will give you a full understanding of the pit falls and simple things that you can do to get ahead of the competition.</p><p style=\"\">For most people, going to a job interview is not something that they do often so this course will give you everything you need to make sure that you put your best foot forward!</p>",
