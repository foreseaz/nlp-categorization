    "description": "<p>The <strong>Power 36 ACT Math</strong> course is a one stop shop to thoroughly prep for the math portion of the ACT. I have spent almost an entire year studying and categorizing all of the official math ACT problems I could find. From the analytics I gathered, I created a specially tailored crash course to educate my students in every single aspect of the ACT math section.</p>\n\n<p>What separates this course from all the other courses out there is that it is \"frequency based.\" What does this mean? It means that you can pick and choose topics based on how often they will likely appear on the real exam. For example, after simply watching videos on the first 2 categories out of 31, \"Triangles\" and \"Graphs and Coordinates,\" you will be able to cover material that will likely constitute nearly 18% of the exam! Here's what is included:</p>\n\n<ul><li>115 walkthroughs of math problems ranging in difficulty from easy to hard</li><li>All necessary rules and operations condensed into just 31 videos of \"Critical Concept\" lectures</li><li>Easy-to-follow explanations of rules and functions</li><li>Essential mnemonic devices to quickly learn and retain material</li></ul>\n\n<p>Enroll today to ensure your optimal ACT math score!</p>",
