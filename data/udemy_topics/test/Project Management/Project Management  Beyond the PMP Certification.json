    "description": "<p>Do you struggle with understanding project management, and how it actually fits into the bigger picture? Do you have goals that you hope to achieve for you, or your organization? Having goals is great, but if you don't know how to make them become real, what good are they? This course is focused on professionals looking to learn more about why project management is so important to goal achievement. </p><p>If you want to understand the bigger picture, and not just focus on the project management technical skills alone (I have other courses that do that!), then this course is exactly what you need! </p><p>Tired of hearing about how \"Agile project management\" is the way to solve everything? This course isn't a lesson on the day-to-day tactics, but instead is a course that shows you what none of the other courses do - WHY project management (whether it's agile project management, Kanban, Agile SCRUM, PRINCE2 or others) is so important! </p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Here's what just a few of my 2,800+ students are saying:</strong><br></p><p><em>\"Excellent course with information concerning critical project management concepts and deployment.\" - Chad<br></em></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>\"Most PM courses I've taken focus only on how to take the PMP exam. This one actually shows you HOW to be a PM who can be both strategic and tactical, and not just \"pass a test\" then not understand what you're doing and why when you get on the job! This course is unique, and I'm really glad I took it!.\"</em> - Austin<br></p><p><br></p><p>\"<em>This course is an excellent way to learn about the basics of project management, especially if you have never been a Project Manager, or if you have noticed a lot of recruitment ad descriptions requesting project management as a skill and you are unsure of whether you have any experience in that yet were never specifically advised that was what you were doing. After the course you will be able to see how Project Management is applicable across various industries and what the differences are between Project Management, Program Management and Portfolio Management, as well as how Project Management is the starting point to get to the other two in your career.\" </em><em> - Alison</em><br></p><p><br></p><p>\"It was very clear presentation and whether one implements project elements or controls them I found the course brought it all together nicely. Really enjoyed the course thks.\" - Rita</p><br><p><strong>Summary: </strong><br></p><p>You'll understand how to perform a bottom-up assessment to see exactly how your current projects and/or programs align (or don't) to your strategy, and explore where the specifics gaps are, so that you can fix them! </p><p><strong>After Taking This Course, You Will:</strong></p><p>- How to increase your salary as a project manager<br></p><p>- The difference between Project, Program and Portfolio management</p><p>- The difference betwen project management and operations management</p><p>- How to create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why you need one</p><p>- The basis of every project, and how it fits into the bigger organizational picture</p><p>- Tools and tips for estimating schedule, cost, and resources needed to be successful</p><p>- Essential templates to use when planning your project</p><p><br></p><p>This course is for you if you are looking to understand the basics of project management, or if you became a project manager with limited training.
