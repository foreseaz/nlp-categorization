Just click on the <strong>“Take this course\"</strong> button. There is no risk. It has <strong>30 days money-back guarantee.</strong> Time is money - just do it!</p><p>Not yet convinced? <strong>Read on!</strong> </p><p>I want to tell you a story - your story.</p><p>You have to use Microsoft Project at work. Maybe your boss told you so, or your company requires it. Bottomline - you launch it first time and it looks like Excel. What a relief! You've used Excel before and this should be a breeze. Right? Well…</p><p>You begin scheduling and the damn thing is not working out for you. It turns out that it is not that straightforward after all. You may find it pretty convoluted, in fact. The breeze turns into hot air. </p><p>Your assumptions turned out to be wrong. Things work differently from what you expected. What's going on? You just can't get it. You spend so much time on it that there is hardly any left for getting things done. And that's when you realize that you need help…</p><p>I am not a psychic most of the time but how do I know all that? Well, it is not your story, it is my story twenty years ago. </p><p>I have suffered through the full-blown, steep like Mount Everest learning curve when I started with MS Project . Which is a <strong>really great news for you</strong>, because now you don't have to. All you need to do is <strong>take this user-friendly and easy-to-follow course</strong> and immediately up your Microsoft Project game. I am a bit envious. I wish I had this opportunity back then.</p><p>You see, as you will learn in this course, MS Project is a great tool, but it is not simply about software. It is also about knowledge of some <strong>fundamental scheduling and project management principles and concepts.</strong> It is about your ability to create a good process and powerful workflow. That's what makes it tough to handle without some guidance.</p><p>Microsoft Project is the most widely-used project management, project scheduling, and project tracking software packages. It is one of those project management tools that every project manager should be familiar with.</p><p>The best guidance you can get for MS Project is through one-on-one tutoring and coaching. Which can be very expensive. That's why I designed this course to be your friendly one-on-one personal training session from the very moment you enroll in it. All for a tiny fraction of the cost.</p><p>In this easy-to-follow MS Project tutorial course you'll learn how to use Microsoft Project 2013, you'll master some of the most important project scheduling and management concepts.</p><p>You'll understand things like: </p><ul> <li>Task relationships,</li> <li>Critical path,</li> <li>Slack or float,</li> <li>Effort-driven scheduling,</li> <li>Resource loading,</li> <li>Resource leveling, </li> <li>and many others. </li> </ul><p>In short, you will learn how to manage projects with Microsoft Project and succeed at your work.</p><p>The Project Management concepts that you'll learn in this course are straight and fresh from the <strong>Project Management Institute (PMI)</strong>. They will be be familiar to you if you already hold one of PMI certifications, for example a Project Management Professional (PMP). On the other hand, if you are new to the Project Management profession and to the Project Management Institute's world, this scheduling course will gradually get you started on the <strong>PMP certification path</strong>, should you choose to follow it at some point. </p><p>Microsoft Project 2013 is the latest version of MS Project at the time this course is developed thus it is what you will focus on in this tutorial course.</p><p>To get the maximum benefit from this course, you need to have a copy of Microsoft Project installed. It should be a newer version: MS Project 2013 recommended, or as a minimum, MS Project 2010. </p><p>After you enroll in and complete this course, you will quickly<strong> learn the best practices</strong> in managing projects with Microsoft Project. </p><p>You will also be able to claim <strong>PDUs - Professional Development Units</strong> towards your PMI certification.</p><p>Well, like I've already mentioned, just click on the “Take this course\" button, grab you lifetime access now and begin to learn. Time is money! Enjoy!</p>",
