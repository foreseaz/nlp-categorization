    "description": "<p>Successful virtual project management and leadership occur when three domains 'task', 'people' and 'change' are in balance. Research shows that the people at the highest level in a company are focused on change such as ‘innovation and development’. People at the mid level are more focused on ‘task and efficiency’. Finally, people at the operational level are primarily concerned with people’s ‘existence’ in social and cultural relations. </p>\n\n<p>All three domains are important and necessary for implemented innovation and many companies often overlook the fact that innovation not only needs to be implemented <em>in the culture</em> but <em>by the culture</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, students are immersed in creative processes and engage with complexity through multiple perspectives taking.
