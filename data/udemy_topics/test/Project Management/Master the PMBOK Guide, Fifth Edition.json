If you've ever tried to read the<em> PMBOK Guide</em> you've probably discovered that while it's informative, it's not an easy read.

Rather than suffering through the <em>PMBOK</em>, let me coach you through the work. In this course we'll cover the entire <em>PMBOK </em>from start-to-finish. </p><p>Throughout this course I include the exact <em>PMBOK </em>reference of what's being discussed, so you can hop over to the<em> PMBOK Guide</em> for more detail, or just keep cruising along in the content.
