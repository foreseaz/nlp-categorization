    "description": "<p>Did you know that in some cities up to 50% of new hosts will de-list their accommodation after just 6 months on Airbnb? In fact, across the globe, Airbnb has a concerningly high turnover rate of hosts. There are many theories about why this is, but one thing is for certain.</p><p>If the hosts had earned more than they expected all whilst reducing the time it takes to look after their accommodation, many would have remained on Airbnb. This is where I come in.</p><p>I'm Oliver Molesworth and I am a long time Airbnb Superhost. Over the years I have watched as hosts come and go from Airbnb. Whilst managing my own accommodation I have noticed some game-changing differences between the way I run my accommodation and how other hosts run theirs. I earn the equivalent of a full-time job through my accommodation, whilst other hosts struggle to get bookings. For the year 2016 alone, I already know I will make over forty-three thousand dollars from a single listing.</p><p>But I'll be honest with you, it wasn't always like this. I've had many years to learn from my mistakes, so I can show Airbnb hosts how to avoid the host pitfalls I've discovered. By avoiding these errors you'll immediately start earning more than you thought possible.</p><p>This course isn't just a bunch of one-off brief videos that I quickly put together. It took me months alone to film all the modules for this course. The result? The first ever Airbnb video course to truly go into the mechanics of how Airbnb runs and what THEY are looking for in the perfect host. This is the most high quality, in-depth look into how to truly succeed at hosting. Yet, is all so simply laid out that even if you've never used Airbnb before, you'll be able to master it immediately.</p><p>I want you to always remain ahead of the crowd. So whenever there is a big update on Airbnb, this course gets an update too. That way, you'll be the first to know how to make the best use of those changes before anyone else works it out.</p><p>Enrol now â€” you'll discover never before released information that will get you to Superhost status in no time, skyrocket your listing's exposure, help you automate your rental so you can spend more time doing the things you love, and of course, earn you more money than you thought possible.</p>",
