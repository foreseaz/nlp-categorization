I know many people who want to travel and they are excited about all the beautiful places around the world but they are still waiting for the right moment. These people are losing so many great life opportunities and in a few years they will regret it. I want to show you how to change a course and be happier.  </p>  <p>  \t                          REMEMBER: &quot;In the end we only regret chances we didn&#039;t take.&quot;  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">This course is for:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                              Everybody who wants to start travelling but also for people who love traveling and want to learn something new.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What you will learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">how to get rid of excuses NOT to travel</li>  \t<li style=\"\">what are the most popular travel websites</li>  \t<li style=\"\">where to buy plane tickets</li>  \t<li style=\"\">where to book accommodation</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how to get accommodation abroad for free</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how you can save money by traveling</li>  \t<li style=\"\">how to stay safe abroad</li>  \t<li style=\"\">and a lot more</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t                      This course will be constantly updated so if I learn something new I will be glad to share it with you:)  </p>",
