    "description": "<p>Welcome to the course that will explain Manufacturing from the very basics – “Manufacturing Guide for Product Development”. Whether you are an engineer, product developer, emerging entrepreneur, or simply an Android or Java Developer who is intrigued by the world of manufacturing, this course will provide skills that will help you in many aspects of your engineering or non-engineering career.<br></p>  <p><strong>Gain Manufacturing Knowledge without Spending $60,000 in Colleges and Universities </strong></p>  <ul><li>Complete overview of modern manufacturing methods</li><li>Video links that demonstrate these manufacturing methods to understand them visually</li><li>All complex industrial processes explained in the easiest manner; No unnecessary technical terms and jargons</li><li>Connection between manufacturing and product development</li><li>Understanding of how everyday products are made like bottles, grocery bags, smartphone case, pipes, metal containers etc.</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Course Summary</strong></p>  <p>Sometimes, even engineers who spend 4 years of college learning theories do not know enough about manufacturing. I have spent countless hours learning manufacturing theories and just as many hours practising in the mechanical engineering industry. I have compiled all the juicy and interesting things in this Udemy course while leaving out unnecessary things so this course is all you need. </p>  <p>Unlike computer programming, manufacturing and mechanical engineering are hands-on fields. You need to visit machine shops and factories to see the actual physical processes in order to learn properly. But, I have manufacturing-related video links in this course that will allow you to learn everything without having to visit hot and dirty factories.</p>  <p>The best thing about this course is that it uses the simplest language and avoids all the technical and unnecessarily complicated wording so you can understand even the most complicated topics with ease. As long as you have passion to learn amazing things, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. </p>  <p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong></p>  <p>This course contains over <strong>40 lectures, 2+ hours of contents, and a compilation of the best video demonstrations</strong> for each topic discussed. </p>  <p>I will cover these topics</p>  <ul><li>Materials</li><li>Plastic Types</li><li>Concept Generation</li><li>Casting</li><li>Molding</li><li>Forming</li><li>Machining</li><li>Powder Processing</li><li>3D Printing</li><li>Joining</li></ul>                      <p>By the time you complete this course, you will feel very accomplished and look at products around you differently depending on your profession. If you are in engineering, you will be able to make great prototypes for your design projects and have more hands-on skills compared to your other classmates. If you are not in engineering, you will develop a good eye for seeing things in terms of manufacturing. you will be able to see your smartphone or your window frames and think how they must have been made!</p>    <p>There is a lot to learn and you will have questions along the way. Feel free to post your questions and ideas onto the discussion board of this course and I will reply with an answer within 48 hours. I encourage students to participate as much as possible. </p>",
