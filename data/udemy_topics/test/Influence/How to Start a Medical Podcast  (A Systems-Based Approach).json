    "description": "<p>A podcast can be a powerful way to reach a specific audience.  Blogs and youtube channels are a dime a dozen, but a high quality podcast in a specific healthcare niche is still relatively uncommon.  And unlike blogs or videos, people can listen to your podcast anywhere, even while they are doing another task such as jogging or washing the dishes.</p><p>I've reached thousands of clinicians across the world with my message about critical care pharmacy. </p><p>How did I do it?  With a podcast!</p><p>I launched The Elective Rotation podcast on July 23, 2015 to an audience of zero. I now have over 27,000 episode downloads and am the #1 ranked hospital pharmacy podcast in iTunes.</p><p>I've received several questions like...</p><p>1. How do you come up with your episode topics?</p><p>2. How do you support the show financially?</p><p>3. What equipment do I need to start podcasting?</p><p>4. Can I still podcast if I'm not very good with technology?</p><p>Those questions are what drove me to create this course.</p><p>In short, the How to Start a Medical Podcast course will take you from zero to launch on your podcast. </p><p>You'll get 23 value-packed lectures and I'll be there to support you throughout the course.</p><p>What are you waiting for?  With lifetime access and a 30 day money back guarantee, there is absolutely no risk to you.</p>",
