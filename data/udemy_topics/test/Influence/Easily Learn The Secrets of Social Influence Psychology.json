Have you ever wanted to get your way more than you do? How do some people get what they want more than other people do? What are the processes by which people influence each other? Psychologists have studied these latter two questions using the scientific method to try to determine the most effective routes to social influence and how social influence can be resisted. In this course, you will delve into the fascinating and useful psychology of social influence. By completing this course, you will gain valuable insight into the push and pull of social interactions, allowing you significantly more success in your personal and professional life. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Every single lecture in this course is backed up by scientific research on this psychology topic. </strong>Because of this, you will also come to develop a rich understanding of the science of social influence by taking this course. Tackling how to get what you want more from a scientific perspective is important: anyone can say that they know how to be influential but only when there are data that have tested how people get what they want can that information be trusted. That is why this course carefully reviews the data gathered in the field of psychology. By focusing on the science of social influence and persuasion, we are able to throw out ideas that don't work and only focus on those that have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to work effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is for you if you want more social influence yourself, or want to be better equipped to resist people's persuasion attempts, or whether you are curious to learn some fascinating social psychology findings. <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"></strong>If you're not satisfied, get your money back within 30 days of purchasing.  <br></p>",
