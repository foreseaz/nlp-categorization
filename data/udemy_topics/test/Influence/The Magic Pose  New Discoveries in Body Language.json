    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  The science has shown that good body language has the power to make or break a deal, aid or destroy your customer service, and facilitate or hinder any interpersonal interaction. MIT has proven the power of body language in negotiations. Dr. John Gottman has proven the power of body language in determining the success or failure of a marriage. And countless other studies have identified the scary truth about your body language. It’s more important than we ever realized.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  What message are you sending? What vibe are you giving off? Is your body language helping or hurting?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Are you sure?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Do you ever wonder what people think about you? Have you ever accidentally given the wrong impression? Do people sometimes not take you seriously? Or perhaps walk on eggshells around you? Or maybe they&#039;re just flat-out mean to you?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Is it possible that they are just sub-consciously reacting to your body language habits?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  &quot;The Magic Pose&quot; is a specific system of body language that is guaranteed to send the right impression and magnetically draw people to you. Easy to remember, easy to use, and incredibly natural, &quot;The Magic Pose&quot; will increase the quality of all of your interactions at work and at home.

While you will learn about how to read body language, the real focus of this course is how to SPEAK body language.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Every person I’ve ever consulted with was making some kind of body language blunder before they met me.
