You can help management find information and troubleshoot problems.  You can even transfer this knowledge to Oracle and MySQL.  </p>  <p>  \tIn this course, veteran consultant, Joey Blue, takes you through the essentials of SQL Server right through advanced topics such as backups, security, and indexes.
