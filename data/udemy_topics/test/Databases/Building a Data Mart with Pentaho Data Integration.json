    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  Companies store a lot of data, but in most cases, it is not available in a format that makes it easily accessible for analysis and reporting tools. Ralph Kimball realized this a long time ago, so he paved the way for the star schema.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">Learning Pentaho Data Integration</em> walks you through the creation of an ETL process to create a data mart based on a fictional company. This course will show you how to source the raw data and prepare it for the star schema step-by-step. The practical approach of this course will get you up and running quickly, and will explain the key concepts in an easy to understand manner. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">Learning Pentaho Data Integration</em> teaches you how to source raw data with Pentaho Kettle and transform it so that the output can be a Kimball-style star schema. After sourcing the raw data with our ETL process, you will quality check the data using an agile approach. Next, you will learn how to load slowly changing dimensions and the fact table. The star schema will reside in the column-oriented database, so you will learn about bulk-loading the data whenever possible. You will also learn how to create an OLAP schema and analyze the output of your ETL process easily.<br style=\"\">  \t   By covering all the essential topics in a hands-down approach, you will be in the position of creating your own ETL processes within a short span of time.  </p>",
