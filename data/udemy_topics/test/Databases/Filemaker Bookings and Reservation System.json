    "description": "<p>In this course we will learn to create a Filemaker system used for making reservations and booking items within a date range. In this example we will be using a hotel room as an example but this can equally be used for car rental, equipment rental, studio rental, library lending. In other words any system where you have items that are in use for specific periods of time.</p><p>What this system allows you to do is simply enter a start and end date and time and then the system returns a list of hotel rooms that are available within that period. </p><p>These free rooms can them immediately be booked or guests that walk in can immediately check in.</p><p>Included in the course are the original FIlemaker File plus extra Filemaker manuals.</p><p>Take this course if you want to simplify your business by creating an application that does all your administrative work exactly the way you want it. Completely tailored to your needs. </p>",
