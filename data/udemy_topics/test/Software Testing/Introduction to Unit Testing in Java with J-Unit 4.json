    "description": "<p>  \tUnit testing is not a new idea, but it has become much more popular in the days of Agile and continuous, iterative development.  Unit tests ensure that quality code is written, and gives the developer and the team the peace of mind to know that changes to the system can be made with confidence.  </p>  <p>  \tThis short module is designed to be like a one-day training session, where the user can come in only knowing how to program in java and leave knowing how to create unit tests against their java code.  </p>  <p>  \tBy the time you&#039;ve completed this course, you&#039;ll know how to create a unit test, as well as understand the different attributes used in testing, along with the valid commands to issue to write good tests.  </p>  <p>  \tAdditionally, this course will help you to learn how to use TDD as a driver for all of your development efforts going forward.  With a &quot;test-first&quot; approach, we change our standard viewpoint of how we write code.  Now, not only do we think about &quot;how do I make this code work,&quot; we also think about &quot;how do I break this code&quot; or more often, &quot;what happens when the user or system doesn&#039;t play nice with our code?&quot;  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is structured to take you anywhere from 2-8 hours to complete, depending on how much of the work you do on your own or just use from the provided samples.  The lessons and knowledge build from the ground up, but the last few lessons could be done in any order, depending on your needs.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you&#039;ve ever wondered how to get started with unit testing, this is the course for you.  This course would also be good for anyone looking to implement testing in future and existing development efforts.  </p>",
