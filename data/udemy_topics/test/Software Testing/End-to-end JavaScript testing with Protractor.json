We will be thinking how to write tests, how to build project architecture, what can be improved in order to test automation. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 1 Introduction</strong>: in this section we have 2 introduction videos which covers course content and <strong>E2E</strong> testing theory.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 2</strong> we will setup all the necessary environment in order to work with Node.js/npm/ and Protractor we verify that Protractor was installed on your machine and explain typical errors during installation. </p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 3</strong> we'll analyse application under test, touch 'params' and start writing first tests for our project i.e login test etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 4</strong> shows us what we can Improve in our test and we are going deeply in advanced Protractor concepts. Also, we'll put project under source control - <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Git</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 5</strong> will be all about code organisation and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Page Object pattern</strong> implementation. We'll write more test there. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Section 6</strong> shows advanced option that you can use with Protractor like cloud integration, directConnect, multiCapabilities, dotenv.
