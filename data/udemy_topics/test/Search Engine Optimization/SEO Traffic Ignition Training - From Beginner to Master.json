    "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to what we consider to be one of the most comprehensive <strong>SEO courses</strong> on the web right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is one of the CRUCIAL elements that can make the difference between running a successful online business or failing with it. </em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Why is that? Simple, because <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">SEO</strong> can put your business<strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF HIGHLY POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS every day.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Google, the most powerful search engine in the world at this moment, gets <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">OVER 3 BILLIONS SEARCHES</strong> every single day. Many of those searches for sure are made by people in your target audience and if they don't see your business there, than they will see your competitors's businesses and buy products or services from them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What does that mean for you? THAT YOU ARE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE</strong> as time goes by and your potential customers don't see you there in the top positions of the search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course was designed by Daniel Ene, an top SEO expert, who is running his own agency and helps hundreds of clients get thousands of new visitors and potential customers every day to their websites and businesses. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">So who is this training for?</strong> </em>This course was designer for any person that runs an online business or wants to start one, for anyone who does online marketing or is involved in any way into online marketing, for people who run their own digital marketing agencies or sell digital marketing services or for <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">anyone who wants to learn how to drive FREE highly targeted traffic to any type of website.</em></strong></p><p>Why we have created this SEO training? This course is not just a simple tutorial. We wanted to create something special, because when Daniel started to learn SEO back in the days, he found only articles that most of them were useless. He wanted to learn from someone who knew what he was talking about, and that had a lot of experience. Unfortunately he had to learn SEO the hard way. We don't want that for you. In this online SEO course Daniel put his entire know how, and we have 14 hours of video content that will help you to learn SEO the easy way. We really think that this is one of the best SEO courses on the web.</p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">So, in this SEO training you will learn:</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How Search Engine works.<br></strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What is OnPage SEO and SEO Link Elements.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Search Engines Basics and how Search Tools work.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">What are the Search Operators, how they work and how to use them.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Which are the Ranking Factors (from Moz and Search Metrics), how they work and how to use them for ranking high.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Which are the Search Quality Guidelines.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to do the Initial Proper Setup of an webiste.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use different basic and ADVANCED Keyword Research Strategies.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use data from Google Analytics and the Google Search Console.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use UNCONVENTIONAL Keyword Research Strategies.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to Create SUPER SEO Friendly Websites.</strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How to use Technical SEO Elements, LINK BUILDING and Competitive Analysis.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>...and much, much more! </em></strong></p><p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em></em></strong><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>Other Benefits</em></strong>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>Lifetime Access to all other updates, SURPISE BONUSES, Methods and System that appear and we will be present in the course!</em></strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>FULL Support through the discussion area of the course!</em></strong></li><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em>30 Day Money Back GUARANTEE if you feel like this course didn't help you at all and you can't apply anything... that is how dedicated I am to your success!</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p><ul><li><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">THIS COURSE WAS CREATED TO TURN ANY NEWBIE INTO AN SEO EXPERT THAT MASTERS THE ART OF DRIVING FREE HIGHLY TARGETED TRAFFIC FROM THE SEARCH ENGINES!</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">So, what are you waiting for?
