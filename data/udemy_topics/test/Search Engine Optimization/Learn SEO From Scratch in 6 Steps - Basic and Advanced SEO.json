    "description": "<p>  \t    Welcome Students,  </p>  <p>  \t    In this SEO course you are going to learn all the different components that make up SEO. Initially we will look at why you would use SEO over other marketing methods, highlighting the key advantages and how you can use SEO for your benefit. We have a great video showing you how we have taken a company’s website from 4,538 visits per month to 20,895 visits per month.  Just to give a little inspiration as to what is possible with SEO in 2014/15.  </p>  <p>  \t    Firstly we will look at the basics of SEO, such as keyword research, SEO jargon, meta titles, meta descriptions and anchor text guidelines. These subjects may be a little basic for some of you, you would also be surprised at how many times we visit business owners who claim to have good SEO knowledge but then we find issues with the SEO basics. So even if you feel you may know all the SEO basics, please pay attention as it may refresh your memory. It may even add a few new skills to your arsenal. SEO is always changing therefore it is really good to always keep up to date.  </p>  <p>  \t    After we have covered the basics we are then going to look at a really clever way of gaining more website visitors. We will do this by putting great practices in place for new content or even revisiting your existing content. This one clever strategy alone could easily triple your website visitors.  </p>  <p>  \t    We are then going to look at body copy; body copy is the fundamental of any great webpage not only for SEO purposes but for conversions too. We will look at all important areas of body copy and provide lots of tips for you to create a great webpage. We also have a learning book for you to go through, this focuses specifically at SEO copywriting in 2014/15.  </p>  <p>  \t    We are then going to go through a website tool we have created just for you. This tool will create a multitude of different website snippets that you can use to further optimise your website. The snippets are something we use for all of our clients and we felt it was necessary for you to have your very own tool. The tool is extremely beneficial for any type of website in any online industry, you will have lifetime access to the tool. The tool also has an International SEO component that will make the process of making websites really simple.  </p>  <p>  \t    We will then move onto website security. This is a really useful section as in 2014/15 website security can even improve your websites rankings. Google sees website security as a trust factor, we will show how you can make your website more secure whilst also gaining an extra little SEO boost.  </p>  <p>  \t    We will then look at codes associated with websites; we will show you the most common codes and more importantly what each code means, if a problem arises you can fix it.  </p>  <p>  \t    Internal and external linking is a misunderstood subject in SEO; created properly it can boost your search engine rankings and provide valuable connections. We will show you the best practices for internal and external linking.  </p>  <p>  \t    Every website has visitors everyday. A large majority of website visitors do not take any action. It is sad I know but a fact of the Internet. In this section we will show you how to make more visitors take action, we will do this by showing you all the different ways to increase visitor engagement. This in its own right will give you an edge over other websites or service providers.  </p>  <p>  \t    One of the most important factors of SEO is site structure and internal linking. Interlinking a well structured website will give amazing benefits to a website, whether its a new or existing website. What most people don’t know is that learning this single subject can make other SEO processes more efficient and therefore reduce your labour time. Do this incorrectly and it can, in some cases, reduce your search rankings.  </p>  <p>  \t    We will then look at authorship, sitemaps and choosing a domain.  </p>  <p>  \t    GWT is a core part of SEO and website management.  We have created a video demonstration of GWT to enable you to gain a better understanding of the programme.  </p>  <p>  \t    We kindly have a video demonstration provided by an external provider showing you how to use GA.  This is a 30 minute video that goes through all the different modules contained within GA. I like to think of GA as a tool to generate more website visitors, understanding which visitors are already buying and from what keywords.  </p>  <p>  \t    Next we will look at off page SEO.  Off page SEO performed correctly can really set you apart from other websites or providers. We have created a series of videos and books for you to go through to understand exactly what you need to do as well as what you should not being doing, which is certainly just as important. We will show you many little bite size tips on how you can find link opportunities that your competitors will not be able to find. We will show you how to understand your competitors link profile and not only how to reverse it, but stop people from reversing your SEO efforts.  </p>  <p>  \t    We will show you:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>Different types of links</li>  \t<li>How to successfully link bait in 2014.</li>  \t<li>How you can use social media for SEO link opportunities.</li>  \t<li>How to amplify any content that you produce, meaning that you can do less work for more reward.</li>  \t<li>How to get an editorial approved</li>  \t<li>Access to our NEW International SEO software.</li>  \t<li>How to make your website ready for international SEO and how to avoid the common traps that most fall into.</li>  \t<li>What local SEO looks like compared to national SEO.</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t    This is a summary of what we cover in off page SEO as mentioning everything would take days. I hope you can see how great this section is and how it can benefit you.  </p>  <p>  \t    We have a course section dedicated to the SEO software that we use.  You will also have a FREE lifetime trial version available in the course. There are 30+ videos showing you how to use the software. Some of the great ways you can use it to reduce analytical, monitoring and link opportunity time.

This data can then be used to make website enhancements. There are many other tools we use, this tool in particular has a larger scope of features and a lower cost, making it ideal for beginners as well as the more advanced.  </p>  <p>  \t    We will then finish off the course by looking at website penalties. There are many different types of penalties that can be applied to a website. We will look at the different types of penalties, how they can happen and how you would fix them. We will show you the exact processes we use for clients that come to us with this problem, whether it’s a manual or algorithmic penalty.
