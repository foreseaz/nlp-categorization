Common problems like blog posts not indexing and other pages showing up in Google that shouldn&#039;t be. In this course I give away my exact system for troubleshooting these type of issues as well as show you how I resolve the indexing issues I discover on a live sample site.</p><p>In the course I use a newer WordPress site as a troubleshooting example for identifying and resolving indexing issues. Although this course uses a WordPress site as the sample many of the processes in the course can be applied to any type of website. </p><p>Included with the course are all the resources you need to troubleshoot Google indexing issues mostly in the form of free online tools.</p><p>This course can be completed at your own pace and all of the curriculum is available upon purchase so you may skip ahead as you wish. Most the lessons are shorter and can be completed in under 15 minutes. I&#039;ve included a longer 45 minute video at the end of the course which is me fixing all the issues I identified in the early course curriculum. </p><p>You should take this course if you want to fix Google indexing issues your website might be expeireincing or if you want to learn how I solve these problems for clients so you may do the same. </p>",
