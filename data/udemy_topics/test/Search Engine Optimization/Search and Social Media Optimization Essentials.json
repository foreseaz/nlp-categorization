A holistic approach is needed to optimize your content for all of the places it may be found online. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThis course addresses optimization tactics as they apply to an overall online presence – focusing on search engines, social media platforms, and the mobile web.  </p>  <p>  \tTraditional optimization methods are discussed, as well as optimization tactics for social media, sharing, and conversion.  </p>  <p>  \tEmphasis is placed on “semantic” optimization tactics; which is rapidly becoming the standard for successful placement in search engines and social media platforms.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Optimizing for Search</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThere is more to Google search than just finding websites; there are universal search databases and Google Plus results to optimize for as well.  </p>  <p>  \tSocial networking sites, blogs, and media communities all have their own search challenges, as does the mobile web.  </p>  <p>  \tSearch and Social Media Optimization Essentials explores optimization tactics for getting found in all of these online arenas.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Optimizing for Sharing</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tYou can no longer rely on people finding your website or blog “by chance” while surfing the Web. Site content must be shared as much as possible within social media channels to get it proper exposure.  </p>  <p>  \tSearch and Social Media Optimization Essentials explores ways to make content more sharable, methods for making the content easy to share, and tactics for optimizing the content so it looks its best once it is shared.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Optimizing for Conversion</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tGoogle Authorship and Rich Snippets improve our visibility in Google search, while Twitter Cards and Rich Pins give our content extra exposure in their respective platforms.  </p>  <p>  \tSearch and Social Media Optimization Essentials demonstrates the semantic or “structured” markup that makes this type of exposure possible.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Holistic Search Optimization Framework</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThe course ends with a discussion on how to create a holistic optimization framework.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Many worksheets, templates, and example code included!</strong>  </p>",
