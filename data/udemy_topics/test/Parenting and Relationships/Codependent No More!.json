Are you always giving to exhaustion?  </p>  <p>  \t            There is a better way!  </p>  <p>  \t            In this course, learn practices to let go of codependency and move into more balanced and happy relating.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">What is Codependence? </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    When you are codependent, you are over-focused on the other and aren&#039;t happy unless they are happy.  </p>  <p>  \t        This leads to you both being dependent on them--co-dependent--for emotional validation and support.  </p>  <p>  \t        Eventually, you become exhausted, resentful, and angry about the situation--even though you are the one that allowed it!  </p>  <p>  \t  Learn how to take a perspective that includes yourself and allows you to let go of the unhealthy reliance on someone else to get your emotional needs met.  </p>  <p>  \t        Codependency is not only limited to emotionally intimate relationships. It can also extend to work, friendship, or community relationships.  </p>  <p>  \t        Working on self-esteem is also included in this course  </p>  <p>  \t        This course consists of three major lectures and I have included the slides as well. It won&#039;t take long to watch. And when you finish, I show you how to continue with additional, deeper material.  </p>  <p>  \t        Release yourself from the bonds of relying on someone else to fulfill your need to &#039;feel important, loved, cared for, and taken care of&#039;. Learn to find your own value, worth, and depth.  </p>  <p>  \t        Connect with others in meaningful, equal relationships where you can express what you want and get it directly instead of falling victim to the trap of codependency.  </p>",
