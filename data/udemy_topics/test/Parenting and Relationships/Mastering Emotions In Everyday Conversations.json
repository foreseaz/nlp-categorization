    "description": "<ul>  \t<p>  \t\t    1.This course is about mastering a simple four step process of handling our emotions during our everyday conversations with people.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t2.There are 10 modules in this course, and there are ‘practice assignments’ after the first 7 modules. This is the uniqueness of this course – it encourages learners to actually learn by experimenting and practising. To this extent, the learners can (must) download and print a “Practice work-book” present in the course.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t3.If a learner had to go through the course in a single go, it would take him/her 60 to 90 minutes. But what is suggested is that the learner takes ample time (a few days), after every module and internalize the learnings and make some new habits and break some old ones.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t4.In module 10, the whole course is uploaded in a pdf document. This is for those learners who prefer reading through the course in their spare time, as convenient to them.  \t</p>  </ul>",
