    "description": "<p>  \t<em>Helping Your Child Learn To Read</em> introduces parents to the key concepts of literacy development in children. We cover ten topics related to emergent literacy, divided into two sections: foundations of literacy and the elements of a balanced literacy program. The course consists of ten lectures, including supplementary materials that outline suggestions and activities for parents who want to promote reading skills in their young children. Take this course to gain insight into the process of learning to read, as well as give your child a leg up in the complex process of learning to read.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course, you will learn:  </p>  <ul>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·How literacy develops from a child’s first exposure to books through their ability to read fluently and comprehend what they are reading.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·How the various stages of literacy development are all about skill-building: from making the crucial connection between sounds and the letters they correspond to on the page.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·How parents can support this development with activities, games, and examples.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·How learning the common terminology of reading development can help parents not only support their young reader but also stay informed about what their child is learning in school.  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  ·How to set your child up for a lifetime of reading exceptionally, whether for school-related purposes or simply as a pleasurable activity.  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t  As a reading educator, I encourage all parents to explore more about the fascinating process of learning to read. Parents with newborns through 2nd graders can enjoy these lectures and feel more empowered to help their child succeed in a literate world.  There is nothing better a parent can do than to model a good example of the importance of reading in everyday life. This course is also excellent for grandparents and other caretakers to learn productive, engaging literacy activities to connect with their young loved ones. Starting with these lectures, you will be ready to begin the exceptional journey of teaching your child how to read.  </p>",
