    "description": "<p>  \t  If you are a single woman, the course you are about to take may well be the most important purchase you made this year. When I wrote the original version of The Boyfriend Test book, it came from the deep trenches of my dating life – the fast-paced world of a single woman, who vacillated between hopefulness and heartbreak. In the first edition of The Boyfriend Test, I tried to put an intellectual eye on some very confusing circumstances that myself and my single girlfriends were living. All we hoped to understand is how to tell if a guy is worth the risk of falling in love with. Fortunately, I had some pretty good instincts and the book became a best seller.  </p>  <p>  \t  Today, I come to you with the wisdom of a Ph.D. in psychology, as an educated teacher, and as a mother, and can assure you of one thing: Finding and keeping a good boyfriend isn’t any easier today. In fact with the expansion of technology and the competition from promiscuous women and the porn industry, creating a secure bond while a woman is still in her fertility window is even tougher these days. But I can also promise you this. I won’t let you down.  </p>  <p>  \t  After writing the first edition of The Boyfriend Test, I continued my journey into the science of relationships. After obtaining a Ph.D in psychology, and after years of coaching women through the treacherous waters that are today&#039;s dating world, I am now offering a course that you can take directly from your home computer.  </p>",
