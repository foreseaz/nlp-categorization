They realize they have a small window to make a big impact. â€œHow do I train my child to be a well-balanced individual?\" Does this sound familiar? You are not alone.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what students are saying about this course:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found it very helpful that the instructor demonstrated the techniques and tools\" <strong><em>Lisa M.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"This course was AMAZING!!!\" <strong><em>Nicky M</em></strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to: Parenting Tips for a Challenging Child in the 21st Century </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instructor E.B. Joseph is going to show you step by show how to create a Parenting Plan to help develop your child into their full potential. She was a challenging child. By fourth grade, she was diagnosis ADHD, prescribed Ritalin and considered placement in an alternative school. When she became a parent, she went seeking alternative ways to parent that type of child. She covers focus training, role play, self-esteem, life survival skills and much more. <strong>Her focus is on parenting a different way for different results.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enroll today! Go from Defiance to Discipline!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t           Disclaimer: She has used these tools with her child (since age four). They work. She cannot speak from experience how they will work if just beginning after age 12. A child over 12 will be more resistance to change because they have become more adapt and more comfortable at pushing boundaries. However, if you are the parent with a child over 12 and you have not given up hope then rally your support system (all influencing adults on board) and try this class.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Course updated: May 2016</p>",
