    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Thinking about becoming a mom can be exciting and terrifying at the same time.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            We all want to be great moms and give our future kids the absolute best start in life. <em>We really really don't want to screw them up! </em>However, knowing exactly how to do that can get very confusing. It's easy to get overwhelmed by the fear of failure, parenting experts advice, our own relationship with our mom, and society's idea of what a good mom is.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>I know motherhood can be an amazing, fun experience, and I've seen it in action.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>I know the best person to guide and advise you throughout your life as a mom is you!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            So how can we prepare for a motherhood like that?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            It does take prep work to get to a place where you can rely on your internal compass, but it is worth it. Books and classes on breastfeeding, birth plans, and parenting philosophies have their place, but the key to being a good mom really is as simple and as hard as finding yourself and being true to who you are.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>You can start preparing for a happy motherhood now with this workshop.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            This curriculum provides you with a <em>strategy and a set of tools </em>that will put you on the path to modern motherhood that will leave you feeling competent, empowered, and successful in the next stage of life. Imagine going into motherhood excited, and confident you can be a great mom with a fun, amazing family.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>What to Expect + The Deets:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            The video-based course is designed to be covered over 6 weeks (or do it at your own pace) with weekly home work and handouts that include writing and journal exercises, interview with a mom, and homework to do with your partner. I even hold office hours in which you can ask me anything. You will also get tons of recommendations for outside resources, even who to follow on Instagram. You can even participate in the course on your phone or tablet.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>What's included in this course:</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            +The formula to be a happy mom â€“ it's super simple and no algebra is involved  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            +Essential mom skills you can practice and hone today  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            +The link between your relationships (with your mom, partner, and yourself) and the effect it will have on your kids and what type of mom you will be  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            +A guide to create a personalized plan to get prepared for motherhood right now  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            You can learn all this at home, and it's less than a trip to the salon or a dress from Anthropology.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Finally, there is a course, not just about parenting or having kids, but about preparing for life as a mom.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            There isn't any other course out there that actually helps you <strong>prevent </strong>the pain of a motherhood filled with feelings of failure, guilt, martyrdom, or fear. No one is really helping women b<em>ecome better moms </em><strong><em>before </em></strong><strong></strong><em>they have kids. </em>However, it makes perfect sense! This is the time to put in the work since you have more time, energy and money to invest in yourself and your relationships.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            I truly believe we can be the first generation of moms with no mom jeans, mom guilt, or mommy wars.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            ______________________________________________________________________  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong>Get Started!</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Click on the green \"Take this Course\" button and join in.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            I've taken several courses on Udemy, and it's an excellent, easy to use site with great customer service.
