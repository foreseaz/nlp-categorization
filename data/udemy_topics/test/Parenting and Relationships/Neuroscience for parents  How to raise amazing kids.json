With over 2000 students, raving reviews, and a student satisfaction of 93%, you can't go wrong with this one...<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Amazing kids...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>How to raise amazing kids... I'm not saying that your kids will become amazing with this course. I'm saying they <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">already</em> are and this course will help you raise them. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It's as much about <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">you</em>, as it is about<em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"> them</em>. This course contains information that every parent should know</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>we will go from the newborn baby to the young adult. I will give you the keys to understand why your child is behaving in a certain way, and more importantly, how to react to it. I will help you grow their self esteem, develop a stable world view, foster their natural talents, help them deal with bullying and peer pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We will cover some fascinating studies about parenting, some do's and don'ts, some tips and tricks, and we will be busting some common myths about parenting as well. You'll learn when to stay firm and when to be lenient, how to stay calm when you're about to loose it, and much more. The course is packed with concrete real life information. I'm a father of two myself, and my two kids are an endless source of inspiration and anecdotes that I'll share with you,</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">The Neuroscience behind the course...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Neuroscience for Parents </em>is based on the NBA - the Neurocognitive and Behavioral Approach. Basically, what the NBA does, is studying how the brain works and its impact on human behavior</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The NBA was developed in France, over a period of 25 years, by Dr Jacques Fradin, at the institute of environmental medicine. It is a fascinating, innovative and multi-disciplinary approach. It combines the fields of neurosciences, social psychology, behavioral sciences and many more to come up with one overlaying, comprehensive theory which gives unique insights in our complex human nature.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the director of the <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Institute of Neurocognitivism </em>I had the chance to work with Dr Fradin and become an expert in his groundbreaking approach. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've developed this course to translate his work into useful insights and tools for parents. Being a parent is probably the most beautiful, ungrateful and difficult task in the world. Also probably the most important one. Therefore, all help is welcome. I know first hand, as I said, I'm a dad myself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">A dynamic course...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now all this neuroscience and scientific studies could come across as complex or even boring. But the truth is, I'm more a communicator than a scientist myself. I'm a strong believer of edu-tainment, and that is exactly what you'll get in this course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there's more to the course than just the recorded lectures. You see, first of all, I'll answer any question you may have within 24 hours (but usually much faster than that). This leads to the comments and questions section being packed with great additional info you can freely go through. On top of that, several times a month, you'll receive educational announcements from me, posts from my blog, with additional insights about parenting. and finally, the course itself will grow over time, as I add more lectures to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people already told me <strong><em>every parent should be taking this course</em></strong>. And who am I to disagree... But don't take my word for it, just scroll down the page and look at the reviews some of the students left. It has been praised by pediatricians and parents alike (and if for any reason you don't agree with them, there's always your 30 day money back guarantee).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Join now, and get the best out of your <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">amazing kids</em>!</p>",
