    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      According to the National Education Association, research has proven that children whose parents are consistently involved in their education:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Perform better on exams </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Earn better grades overall </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Pass classes and earn credits more consistently</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Adapt and transition well to school environments</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Tend to finish high school &amp; study at the university level</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t          But you probably suspected this was the case already, right? And when you think about it, it makes sense given that you know your child better than anyone. You were his or her first teacher. You want them to achieve all that they are capable of achieving. Of course your involvement is important to your child&#039;s learning success.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Now you just need someone to tell you what you need to know to begin coaching your child to better learning. And maybe you&#039;d like to connect with other parents who are doing the same thing. Does that sound about right? If so, this course is exactly what you&#039;re looking for!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t               This course is designed to assist parents who want to coach their children in the development of effective and efficient thinking and learning skills. In this course, I use common everyday language to address topics such as:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Is all learning the same?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What are your child&#039;s individual learning preferences?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Do we all have personal learning preferences and approaches?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How should we think about thinking?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">What are critical thinking skills?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Who&#039;s in control?</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How does dependence/independence influence thinking and learning?</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t        This might sound like a lot to learn. But, this course is just what you need to get started quickly and confidently. And I&#039;ll be here to help you along the way.  </p>",
