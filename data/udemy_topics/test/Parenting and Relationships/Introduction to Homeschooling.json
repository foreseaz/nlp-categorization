    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course aspires to be your one-stop-shop for all things homeschool!</p><p style=\"\">Through the videos, documents, resources, and most of all through personal interaction with me in the discussion forum...you will learn EVERYTHING you need, and then some, to get started.</p><p style=\"\">The homeschooling landscape can be vast and confusing.  I know, I used to be in your shoes, not long ago.  There can seem to be too much information out there and not enough information at the same time!</p><p style=\"\">That&#039;s where this course comes in.  You have homeschooling questions - I have answers, good ones too.</p><p style=\"\">I&#039;ve been helping parents navigate the homeschooling landscape for years now through my videos, blogs, informally among my local groups and friends, and as private clients.</p><p style=\"\">You see I could talk homeschooling all day, everyday.  I&#039;m that passionate about parenting and about education.</p><p style=\"\">Parents seek me out and take my advice for the simple, obvious fact that I&#039;ve achieved amazing results with my own kids.  It all really started when I started posting videos of my son deriving the quadratic formula on YouTube.  He was only six years old! </p><p style=\"\">Yeah, he started algebra at age 5 and calculus at 7.  He also started winning competitive chess tournaments; he was an early prolific reader (500+ pages a day, easily); an impressive public speaker; a piano prodigy; and now at 10 years old he&#039;s already getting paid to design websites.</p><p style=\"\">His sister Christine is dynamite as well.  You&#039;ll meet them both in this course and I&#039;ll gladly share with you everything I&#039;ve done to accelerate their education.</p><p style=\"\">But most of all, you&#039;ll see that my kids are profoundly happy.  And this is what homeschooling is all about.</p><p style=\"\">You love your kids more than anything.  You want to see them happy not just in the present, but throughout their lives. </p><p style=\"\">You sense that &quot;school&quot; will fail you and your kids....far into the future.</p><p style=\"\">And you sense that there has to be something to &quot;homeschooling&quot; since nearly 3 million American children are homeschooled now and the movement is growing clear across the globe.</p><p style=\"\">Guess what, you are right on both counts!</p><p style=\"\">Join me on my course and you&#039;ll see that homeschooling is not merely an alternative to school - that it&#039;s an amazing decision that will not only launch your kids but it will invigorate your entire family in ways you could never have imagined!</p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><br style=\"\"></p>",
