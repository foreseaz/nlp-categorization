    "description": "<p>  \t Nearly half a million babies in the United States alone are born premature. That means that every 1 in 8 babies are considered “preterm.” Important fetal growth and development occurs, even in the last weeks of pregnancy. Learning about how to care for your baby and foster their development outside of the womb, and especially at home, is a valuable tool for parents.  </p>  <p>  \t In this course, as a parent or caregiver, you will be provided with helpful and timely information about caring for your baby after discharge from the hospital. You will learn about ways to interact with your baby, and how to best support your baby during daily routines such as sleep, feeding, and play. You will complete this course with heightened awareness of how your baby is communicating, learn methods on adjusting your baby&#039;s environment and understand more on how to support feeding.  </p>  <p>  \t Taking your baby home for the first time may leave you with a mix of emotions: excitement, pride, anxiety, anticipation, concern... however here at Affirming Parenthood, students will add skills and knowledge to their parenting toolbox and have more confidence in caring for their baby during daily interactions. The first months are the most crucial for development, and here, Affirming Parenthood will teach parents the necessary skills to care for these resilient babies. Also, you’ll have access to professional experts in the field of caring for premature infants, and more resources at your fingertips.  </p>  <p>  \t This course is compiled of 4 videos and 1 lecture, all less than 8 minutes long, so that you can complete each on your own time. As new parents, we understand that time does not come easy! You will also have the opportunity to print out materials, and practice your new knowledge of “reading babies’ cues” so that you can become the expert in your own child.  </p>  <p>  \t So take the lead and be your child’s advocate in learning how to best understand their needs, and how to communicate with your baby long before he speaks his first words.  </p>",
