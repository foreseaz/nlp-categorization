    "description": "<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder impacts 1 in 68 children according to the Center for Disease Control's 2014 report. 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls. Autism brings tremendous joy in each individual's unique strengths and quirks. Parenting a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder can bring additional and specific challenges into the home. Meltdowns can be considered one of these challenges. This course is designed to assist parents and caregivers in learning how to identify the root cause(s) of their child's meltdown(s), design replacement behaviors, as well as incentive systems for positive reinforcement. I've taken years of experience in public and private sectors and synthesized information in order to empower parents, caregivers, educators and mental health providers with the tools needed to make pertinent changes to one of the most problematic behaviors impacting individuals on the Autism Spectrum: meltdowns. Take this course to reduce and stop meltdowns from disrupting your homes, classrooms, and/or daily routines. Information, tools and strategies needed are simply a click away. Information is provided using a differentiated approach in a succinct manner in order to ensure optimal success. Presentations with audio, video, and downloadable materials are all present and ready to be immediately implemented within your environment. </p>",
