    "description": "<p>This course highlights the use of questions, simple communication techniques, and clear thinking to find love in your life. The tools discussed here can you help you meet new people and re-meet your family and friends in a deep way.</p><p> <br> At the end of this course, you will be able to use these proven strategies to truly get to know a person and determine where that person “fits” in your life. A friend? A spouse or girlfriend/boyfriend? Maybe just an acquaintance? These 5 strategies will allow you to have clear information on whether to decide to choose to love or to choose to let a person go. <br> <br> You should take this course if you want to find love and connect on a deeper level with loved ones already in your life. If you are looking for a purely physical connection with no long term potential, this is likely not the course for you. You do not need to have any specific knowledge or awareness prior to taking this course beyond being open to trying something new in your dating life and/or friendship development</p>",
