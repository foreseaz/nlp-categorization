You are about to enter into the most exciting adventure of your life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t           Without doubt your marriage is the greatest investment you will ever make. And you will want to make sure that you have everything you need to make it happy, successful and rewarding.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t           Many couples spend hundreds of hours planning their wedding, but very little time planning their marriage. So before the big day, here is an opportunity to sit together and reflect on what it is that you want from your marriage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t <strong>&quot;Get Ready for Marriage&quot;</strong> helps you think about your marriage, what you want it to be and what you want to be for each other. Unlike most marriage preparation courses, you can do this course in the privacy of your own home without having to share your thoughts about your relationship with strangers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t           Conducted by experienced marriage coach and wedding celebrant, Jonathan Payne, who has worked with hundreds of couples over some 20 years, <strong>&quot;Get Ready for Marriage&quot;</strong> is fun, informative, thought provoking and inspiring. Exactly what you need before the moment you say &quot;I do&quot;.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t <em>(And of course if you are already married, this course will give you the chance to think about your relationship and give it a few &quot;touch ups&quot; to ensure it remains the happy, loving, rewarding experience you deserve).</em>\r\n</p>",
