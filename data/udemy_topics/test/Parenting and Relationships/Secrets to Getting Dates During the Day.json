    "description": "<p>Do you wish you had SUPER-POWERED CHARISMA?</p>  <p>  \t Do you wish you could speak to beautiful women with total confidence?  </p>  <p>  \t Are you curious about those guys who seem to be able to chat up women ANYWHERE and wind up with more dates in a month than most guys have in a year????  </p>  <p>  \t Ummmm yeah...  </p>  <p>  \t Then join hundreds of students who've taken this course and transformed their social lives while meeting amazing women AND becoming the best version of themselves possible.  (whew, that's a mouthful!)  </p>  <p>  \t <strong>The Magical Tale of This Class (and my date hacking adventure)</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t I used to be terrible with women...  </p>  <p>  \t Even though I was smart, friendly, and fairly confident in myself, I still found myself struggling to get a girlfriend or ANY girl to want to date me (ARGHHH).  I was frustrated beyond belief with my dating life.  So I took a hard look at myself and asked:  </p>  <p>  \t \"How could I improve myself in a way that would make me MORE proud of who I am while getting MORE of the girls I want in my life??\"  </p>  <p>  \t Through hundreds of hours of introspection and literally thousands of hours out honing my social skills over the past 5 years, I've become the charismatic guy I dreamed of and have never been more proud of my honesty or integrity.  If you look at the other aspects of my life, the pattern becomes obvious . . . I'm LIVING THE LIFE I CHOSE RATHER THAN THE LIFE I WAS FLOATING INTO.  </p>  <p>  \t Does taking control of your dating lifestyle sound interesting to you?  What would you do if you were living your life 100% on your own terms?  </p>  <p>  \t Along the way one of the things I discovered was this:  </p>  <p>  \t It is incredibly easy and FUN to meet amazing women during the day.  You just have to know how.  </p>  <p>  \t So few people know how though!  And because it has been so life-changing, I wanted to save all the guys interested in learning the countless hours and mistakes I made.  So I started teaching this stuff in small classes.  And the response from the students was totally phenomenal:</p>  <p>  \t “Are you kidding me? This is the most useful real-life skill class I have EVER attended. I am an absolutely beginner at this and it was eye-opening to see that these guys have the game pat down while I was bumbling out there. Absolutely recommend.\" - P.V.  </p>  <p>  \t \"Crucial identity level changes worth hundreds of dollars . . .\" - Kevin B.  </p>  <p>  \t \"I cannot find words describe the respect I have for Ben and Charlie, their attitudes, values and optimistic outlook on life . . .If you are like me, the type of person who never settles, and is always striving to achieve your full potential, this is the community you want to associate yourself with.\" - Ben W.  </p>  <p>  \t \"Charlie does an absolutely incredible job of showing how you can conflate morality with extroversion to truly achieve a \"kick-ass\" life.\" - Jordan T.  </p>  <p>  \t “Charlie knows exactly what he's talking about and is a great speaker. I'd recommend his classes to anyone, even if they didn't think they needed help, just for the experience.\" - Nick. R  </p>  <p>  \t \"This class kicked ass. Charlie and Ben are masters of their craft and break down everything they've spent years learning into a digestible, concise format that's fun to consume. All their information is actionable and I've already put some of it into practice 2 days later. Highly recommended - These guys rock.\" \" - Scott B.  </p>  <p>  \t \"Get the inspiration and permission to fully embrace the confidence, authentic man that's buried under years of bad social programming.\" - Drew. L  </p>  <p>  \t I took the BEST of the classes and expanded upon it to deliver the ultimate class on courage, taking control of your dating life, and meeting women during the day....  </p>  <p>  \t In this course you'll learn:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t The simple (and laughably easy) way to initiate conversation with any woman during the day  \t  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t The best way to set up a date that she is going to be excited for  \t  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t How honesty can differentiate you from every other guy she's ever met  \t  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t Exactly what sign to look for to know she wants to be kissed  \t  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t Inner game workshops to hardwire your brain and prevent yourself from wussing out of speaking to the beautiful women you pass on a daily basis  (THE WORST)  \t  \t</li>  \t<li>  \t  \t\t A  blueprint to take action on everything I'll teach you so that you have CONCRETE STEPS to transform your dating life, develop REAL confidence, and meet amazing girls in your city  \t  \t</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t And JUST to be clear . . . this isn't one of those \"get girls to fawn over you by using one super secret technique\" scams (UGH).  </p>  <p>  \t If you want the \"make her fall in love over text\" version, this course is not for you.  This course is about changing your life.  Which means it is going to require you to put in some effort!  Nothing in the course is impossible or even all that hard, but it DOES require courage and commitment.  </p>  <p>  \t That's the price you pay to embark life's most worthwhile journeys . . .  </p>  <p>  \t No matter who you are, I guarantee you'll learn at least one thing from this dating lifestyle class (see the testimonials above for proof).
