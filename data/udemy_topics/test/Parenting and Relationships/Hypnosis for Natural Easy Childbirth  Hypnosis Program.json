All fears and most of the pain that you may have heard about giving birth or being in labor are created by those people who gave birth with fear in their minds. Because it was this fear that caused them to tense their body causing restrictions in the natural birthing process because nature never created your body to have pain while doing anything that was a natural part of life. As human beings we are part of the animal kingdom how many times have people found kittens born of their cats and never heard a thing or puppies, chickens who lay eggs everyday with out a peep that is because no one has told them to be afraid of their own natural processes .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em> I am going to teach you in this Hypnosis Course</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>What is EFT Emotional Freedom Technique and how to apply it.</strong></li><li><strong>What fear is and where it comes from</strong></li><li><strong>How to eliminate fear with EFT</strong></li><li><strong>What pain is </strong></li><li><strong>How to reduce or eliminate pain</strong></li><li><strong>how the mind and body are connected</strong></li><li><strong>proof that you can change how you feel by using just your thoughts.</strong></li><li><strong>How to feel good any time </strong></li><li><strong>The benefits of Hypnosis and who can  be hypnotised</strong></li><li><strong>How to communicate with your baby inside you</strong></li><li><strong>Completely reprogram your mind to having the most enjoyable childbirth for you</strong></li><li><strong>Lots of bonus downloads   </strong></li><li><strong>Complete 3 week Hypnotherapy Program as used with my Clients </strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>All videos are downloadable for ease of viewing off line </em></strong></p>",
