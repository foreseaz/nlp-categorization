    "description": "\r\n<p><strong>What dreams and aspirations do you hold for your children? </strong>If you’re like most great parents you likely include things like: to be eager to learn and willing to confront challenges; be proud of their own accomplishments; grow up with confidence &amp; a love of adventure; and be resilient in the face of the setbacks and failures. But with <em>one in five teens experiencing depression</em>, it would appear many parents were not successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If only you could help inoculate your kids against depression while they’re younger</strong> … well, perhaps you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the book, <em>The Optimistic Child</em>, by Martin P. Seligman, Ph.D., this course shows you how to teach your children the skills of optimism—helping them to achieve more both at school and in life. Learn about:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the fundamentals of optimism &amp; pessimism</li>\r\n\t<li>feeling good vs. doing well</li>\r\n\t<li>strategies to boost the ability to combat depression and come back from failure</li>\r\n\t<li>research findings of leading experts</li>\r\n\t<li>common “mistakes” that may actually erode optimism</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As well, have the chance to ask questions and interact with the course instructor, Rob Stringer, an International Parenting &amp; Youth Coach, and Founder of Youth Coach Global—an international organization or professional coaches that help today’s youth live lives they LOVE!</p>\r\n",
