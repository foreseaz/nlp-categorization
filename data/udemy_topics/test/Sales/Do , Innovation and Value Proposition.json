    "description": "<p>  \tSome believe that product success depends upon having some technology that is better than something else and as a result the world will beat a path to that product&#039;s door. Others think that if they simply get into a room and brainstorm ideas or even play ideation games, the right ideas will automatically come forward and the product will succeed.</p><p>  \tBoth are wrong. And as a result somewhere between 40% or more products “flop up onto the shore as dead fish&quot; as Steve Jobs once said.  \t  \tSuccessful products start with clearly understanding what people and organizations “do&quot;. What they do, how they do it, why they do it and so forth. This course enables the participants to figure out what their prospective customers “do&quot; and then translate that into a compelling “value proposition&quot;. Together the “dos&quot; will enable engineering to build the right product and the value propostion will direct marketing to get the marketing plan right.  \t  \tTogether, implementing the right “dos&quot; and “value proposition will ensure product success. .  </p>",
