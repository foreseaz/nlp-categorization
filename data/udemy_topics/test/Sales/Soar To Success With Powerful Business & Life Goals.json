I was physically and mentally exhausted. More importantly, I was not achieving any of my goals, in fact, I was going backwards. That was until I was fortunate to attend your training! My life changed thanks to your seminar. It got me to review the way I approached every aspect of my future, prioritizing and planning exactly what I wanted to be, to do and to have. It created a balance in all areas, work, health, relationships, spirituality, etc. I am now healthier, more relaxed and achieving my goals. I have created my own business and expanded in ways that I would never have imagined.&quot;</em></p><p style=\"\">J. Rodrigues – AC Dynasty – Melbourne</p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">“I very much needed &#039;something&#039; to give me the confidence, courage, strength and stamina necessary to assure not just the survival of my company but the actual rebuilding of it. This course did exactly that for me. I looked at what&#039;s important in my life, I took time out to step back and look at the big picture. As a result I am now back on track with my planning and goal setting. The seminar injected me with the drive and enthusiasm one needs to turn dreams into reality. I will be forever thankful that I had the opportunity to attend your seminar.&quot;</em></p><p style=\"\">B.
