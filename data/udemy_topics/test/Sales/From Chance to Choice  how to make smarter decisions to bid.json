    "description": "<p>Competitive bids and tenders can be a lucrative source of new business, new projects and funding opportunities for commercial businesses, professional services firms and not-for-profit (non-government) organisations. But it's not easy to win business this way, and many people exhaust their energy by pursuing too many marginal opportunities that they don't have a good chance of winning.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Learn how to make better proposal pursuit decisions and increase your win rates</strong></p><p>This program is designed for people who sell to business and/or government and who need to pitch for contracts, funding or projects through competitive bids, tenders or large-scale proposals. It doesn't matter if your organisation is large or small – if you sell through competitive tenders, this program will be helpful to you.</p><p>It is helpful to have participated in at least one competitive tender before you start the program. However, this is not essential.</p><p>From Chance to Choice is designed for time-poor, busy managers and professionals and contains just over an hour of useful, practical content delivered over five concise modules.</p><p>In Module 1, you'll find out why so many people struggle to make good decisions about the competitive tenders they expend their energy on. Explore the pros and cons of traditional decision-to-bid techniques, find out why the sacred cows of business development don't apply here, and learn what it really takes to be successful in a competitive proposals environment.</p><p>In Modules 2 and 3, you'll answer the question “should you bid\"? Module 2 explains the underlying concepts that sit behind the Opportunity Assessment tool that accompanies this program. There are six main areas that need to be considered in making a decision to bid, and three questions for each area that will help you determine how well you are positioned and the level of “opportunity fit\". In Module 3, you'll watch a practical demonstration of the Opportunity Assessment Tool and then complete an example exercise where you will decide whether or not to bid on a particular opportunity. </p><p>In Module 4, you'll answer the question “can you win\"? Learn why we need take our internal view out of the equation before we make our final decision, and unpack what it really takes to emerge as the clear winner in any competition you choose to join.</p><p>In Module 5, you'll learn how to embed the Opportunity Assessment tool and process within your organisation, and where to go to engage more help and learning. </p>",
