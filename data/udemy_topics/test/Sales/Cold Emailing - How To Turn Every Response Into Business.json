    "description": "<p>You have bitten the bullet and have started cold emailing to create new business opportunities. </p><p>You are now realizing that it isn't always as easy as it seems because a very small percentage reply back saying \"sounds great, let's talk\". Instead they reply back with things like - \"I'm in contract\", \"Send Info\", \"We do it in-house\" and you don't have a system for how to deal with those. Until now you haven't been able to find a system for this.</p><p><strong>This course is the missing link!</strong></p><p>This course is the missing link because it provides a repeatable process to turn <strong>every </strong>response from a cold email into a first telephone call. </p><p>This <strong>IS NOT</strong>  hours and hours of long winded video content and hundreds of different scripts, templates and external resources.</p><p>We have invested thousands of hours creating this process over 10 years of cold calling and cold emailing projects. It works.</p><p>What you are getting <em>is one proven process</em> that you can use for every single response to a cold email to turn it into a first telephone call.</p><p><br></p><p>Feedback on the course:</p><p><em>\"The most effective course on Outbound Prospecting I've ever seen. You are a master at what you do...\"</em> <strong>John Duvenage</strong><span></span></p><p><em>\"I'm an experienced outbound prospector...and I can confidently say, this is the most thorough, innovative and practical resource I have come across\"</em>  <strong>Selina Prager</strong><span></span><br></p><p><em>\"This is a highly polished system, which is easy to follow, easy to understand, and straightforward to apply.\"</em> <strong>Andrew Lloyd Gordon</strong> <span></span><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANT: One or two people have skimmed the information abopve and have felt that the title misrepresents the course. Don't be one of those.</strong></p><p><strong>THIS COURSE IS NO GOOD FOR YOU IF YOU AREN'T ALREADY COLD EMAILING. THERE ARE NO TEMPLATES OR 'HACKS'. THIS IS A SYSTEMIZED WAY OF CREATING VALUE TO 'SELL' EVERY SINGLE RESPONSE YOU GET FROM COLD EMAILS AND DOES NOT COVER THE INITIAL COLD EMAIL PROCESS.</strong></p><p><strong>IF YOU LEAVE FEEDBACK SAYING THERE ARE NO TEMPLATES OR IT DOESN'T COVER THAT THEN IT IS CLEAR YOU'VE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE COURSE IS ABOUT. DON'T BE THAT PERSON...</strong></p>",
