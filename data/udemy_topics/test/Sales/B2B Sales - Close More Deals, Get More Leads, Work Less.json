These professionals automate sales results and get their process down to a science.  </p>\n\n<p>If you're here, it means you want to close more deals, land more qualified leads, and make more sales.  Guess what?  The things you learned yesterday probably won't apply for much longer: B2B sales is being massively disrupted by technology.  It's time to get ahead of the curve...</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering:</p>\n\n<p><strong>-How do I close B2B lead opportunities?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rest easy! You'll learn the whole process from first contact, to qualification, to close.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-I have virtually no experience in B2B Sales. How do I drastically increase my value in a short amount of time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check!  I fell into the sales world with no experience, and I struggled for a while.  Within a year, I figured out how to achieve six-figure results.  You'll learn from my experience while avoiding my pitfalls (learn more about me below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>-How can entrepreneurs successfully outsource B2B lead generation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't sweat it!  By the end, you'll know how to use VA's and other freelancers to deliver qualified leads on a silver platter. You'll learn a step-by-step process that takes 30 days or less.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-What are the best tools and services for generating high-quality B2B leads and sales?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Glad you asked!  You'll learn about dozens of apps and resources that only the most savvy B2B sales professionals know about.  Plus, you'll get exclusive access to my very own spreadsheet tools. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Learn the B2B sales strategy that won us business with 16 Fortune 500s.  We went from 0 to $1.4 Million. </strong>As the first employee and Senior Account Manager at IdeaRocket, a startup that creates explainer videos for businesses, I was thrown into the world of sales with no experience.  After floundering for a while, I realized I needed to change my game.  I studied intensively, applied new technologies and tools, and practiced through hundreds of calls and outreach opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Within a year, I tripled the sales of our 2-person company, bringing increase of $282,188.  I won business with big companies like <strong>Electronic Arts, Verizon</strong>, and <strong>Bank of America</strong>, as well as successful tech startups like <strong>Venmo</strong>.  After hiring a junior colleague, we achieved $1.4M in revenue by the time I departed in late 2014.  Now I write books, create courses, and practice sales strategies on an entrepreneurial basis.</p>\n\n<p>If you follow these lessons and take action, I'm confident you'll be on your way to joining the modern sales elite.  Among other major benefits, this means generating a continuous flow of leads, sales, and fat commissions.  </p>\n\n<p>As a friendly reminder, this is a no-risk course. It comes with a <strong>30-day, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee</strong>.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>\n\n<p>See you inside,</p>\n\n<p>Dan</p>",
