WHY DON'T YOU?</p><p><strong>Look at what they say about this course!</strong></p><p>\"Looking forward to the next course<br></p><p>This course is an introduction to a series on branding strategy. I had not heard of the magneter model before. Thus far, the manner in which the information has been presented seems innovative and not a rehash of the usual branding training. I look forward to the next in the series. Instructor is engaging and seems to be an expert on the topic.\"</p><p><span></span>***********************</p><p>I’m <strong>Francisco Trigueros</strong> and I want you to join me in this course to show you what I’ve been working for the <strong>last years</strong>. I’ve spent <strong>countless hours</strong> working and <strong>self-learning</strong> all this from so many experts in the World, some are friends and some are not, and I want to share it with you because I promise that <strong>you won’t find no content like this anywhere in the Internet </strong>since I’ve developed it all by myself <strong>during the last years</strong>.</p><p>This will be a <strong>1 hour course</strong> where I’ll share my <strong>discoveries</strong> (I sometimes call them <strong>revelations</strong> since they come to me in those AHA! moments), my <strong>new developments</strong> and <strong>methodologies</strong> on how to create your brand, how to build it strong and how to make it grow to unlimited heights. Though I’m now <strong>specialized in the luxury market</strong>, since it is one of the few markets that <strong>strive for excellence</strong> and I chose to be <strong>surrounded by excellence</strong>, all this knowledge <strong>can be applied to any industry</strong> and any brand no matter how small or how big it is.</p><p>As you can imagine, this course is for those who want to <strong>stay away from mediocrity</strong> and also <strong>be surrounded by excellence</strong> <strong>in their work</strong> and <strong>in their lifes</strong>.</p><p>Most of the insights and techniques that I’ve developed <strong>have been quite effusively recommended </strong>through <strong>my articles in LinkedIn</strong> by many CEO’s, consultants and executives of some of the <strong>most prestigious firms</strong> in the World within the luxury market as you might have seen at the bottom of the <strong>Home or the contact page</strong>.</p><p>If you’re <strong>planning to create a new brand</strong> or <strong>you’ve already started a company</strong> and are struggling with getting <strong>more clients, more sales and more engagement</strong>, and want to <strong>lead your industry</strong> regardless of the competence,<strong> this is your course</strong>.</p>",
