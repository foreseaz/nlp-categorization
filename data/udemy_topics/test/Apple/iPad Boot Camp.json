    "description": "<p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">In April of 2010 Apple introduced the world to a new device, the iPad. In less than a year Apple sold nearly 15 million iPads. It took Apple a little over two years to sell over 100 million of their popular tablets worldwide. There is no doubt that the iPad is a popular device, however, many iPad users would admit to having limited knowledge on how to use the device. Essentially, that is what this Udemy course is all about, teaching people how to better utilize their iPad.</p>  <p style=\"\">  </p><p style=\"\">This class is for anybody who has a need to learn more about how to use the iPad. In some respects this class is both your missing iPad manual and your Apple Genius Bar rolled into one class. Get your iPad, get this class, and get ready to learn.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\"></p>  ",
