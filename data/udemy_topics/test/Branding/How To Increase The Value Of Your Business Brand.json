Some people believe branding is just about design.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Ask the average person to define a companies brand and they will start describing the company logo.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Unfortunately there are many business owners who also don’t fully understand the depth and breath of branding.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Yes the logo is one representation of the brand as it does the work of visually identifying a product or service related to the company. But if you just stop there you’re not branding – you’re tagging.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Admittedly, the origin of branding came from placing a mark or symbol on cattle, to identify who they belong to, but the practice of branding has developed immensely since then.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  It’s not very difficult to place an image on a product and call it a brand. It’s a bit like printing some visuals on a T-shirt and claiming to have a clothing line. There is much more to Branding than names, fonts, colours and graphics.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  From developing a brand mission statement and vision, are brand strategy, establishing a brand voice, and defining a brand promise.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  It is not a process that can simply take place in the office while trying to juggle all the other tasks involved in running your business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Creating a sustainable, iconic brand can take weeks, months and even years of brainstorming and whiteboarding, reviewing and redesigning, scripting and rewriting and split testing in different customer segments.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  It is very easy to get a brand wrong.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  We will never know or be able to number the amount of brands that have been developed and failed miserably, never seen the light of day in the marketplace.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  But those companies that understand the correct process of branding can be clearly identified just by looking at those brands which has stood the test of time. And even looking at those younger brands (less than 20 years old) that have quickly risen to the top of their industry and stand head and shoulders above their competitors.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">  HOW WILL THIS COURSE BE DELIVERED?  </strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Tony has always been a very hands-on, Practical person, and he is a creative at the core, and this is the approach he takes when delivering this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  You will not be overwhelmed with theory.
