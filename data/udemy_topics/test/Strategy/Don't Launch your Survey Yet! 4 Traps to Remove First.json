But if you are using SurveyMonkey<sup>TM</sup>, Survey Gizmo<sup>TM</sup>,Qualtrics<sup> TM</sup> or any of the other 85 web-based survey tools then you are <u>automatically</u> losing responses and getting less meaningful results! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">How is that possible?</strong>   Each of these tools has built-in \"traps\" - defaults and standard settings that automatically decrease your response rates, muddy the results and make you lose information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Why would these companies allow this?</strong> Web-based survey companies offer great technology but they <u>do not know</u> the psychology behind <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">why</strong> people will fill out surveys. They <u>do not understand</u> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">how</strong> psychological measurement works. They <u>do not have</u> the training or expertise to recognize <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">where</strong> these problems exit. So their survey tools and recommended templates contain \"worst practices\" that you <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">must</strong> <u>identify and eliminate</u> from your surveys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one-hour training course you will learn: (1) to identify and avoid the \"traps\" found in most web-based survey tools; (2) why these standard practices lead to poor results and low response rates; and (3) to apply research-based and field-tested solutions to increase the quality and usefulness of your results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>► This may well be the most worthwhile and productive hour of learning you will invest all year! <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">When you complete this course you will be able to:</strong> <br></p>\n\n<ul>  \t<li>Identify and avoid the \"traps\" found in most web-based survey tools;</li>  \t<li>Understand why these standard practices lead to poor results and low response rate</li><li>Apply research-based and field-tested solutions to increase the quality and usefulness of your results.</li></ul>",
