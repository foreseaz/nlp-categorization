    "description": "<p>Art of War is one of a handful of <strong>must read</strong> leadership classics.<br>It is one of the most quoted but least understood books on the subject.<br><br>It's also quite a difficult read because 60% of the book is about the Chinese terrain and climate and about moving men and supplies.<br>This can feel like a waste of your valuable time but the remaining 40% is <strong>pure gold.</strong><br><br>It's a book about the <strong>mental and spiritual</strong> preparation for leadership.<br>It makes it very clear that strategy and the motivation of others begins with self control.</p><p>In this course we focus all of your attention onto the gentle art of stilling the mind to feel the force.<br>In 45 minutes you will discover the essence of Sun Tzu's leadership message without needing hours of study.<br><strong></strong></p><p>The book is <strong>NOT</strong> a manual on ways to be ruthless and unprincipled.<br> In fact it's the polar opposite whilst still having the objective of instructing the reader in the ways of <strong>undisputed and total success.</strong></p><p>  \t  \t<br>  </p>",
