    "description": "<p>Documentation is nowadays regarded as an integral part of selling a product or service to customers. You might have at your disposal the best technological systems, publishing applications and the related tools for working and editing your content, but without the proper best practices in place, chances are the processes you implement for taking care of the life cycle of your documentation will not be planned and managed adequately, which means that you will be less successful in your operations.</p>    <p>You need best practices for several reasons - for example, they allow you to plan the delivery of your documentation in a more rigorous manner, allow you to cut down on costs, have more visibility of your processes and be able to manage your human and technological resources in a better way, among other benefits. The great thing with best practices is that they allow you to implement your systems, processes, and roles within a framework that is future-proof and that you can reconfigure as, and when required.</p>    This course is all about these best practices and is an invaluable reference for anyone wishing to take document management to the next level. You will gain awareness of all the fundamental considerations for turning documentation into, not only a corporate-wide function, but also to improve the way you think about the delivery of your documentation at a personal level. Furthermore, while this course is primarily focused on document management, it is by no means limited to that - meaning you will find it really helpful in any environment where building a successful strategy for the delivery of content is required, whether that be finance, legal, engineering, software and many more. So, dive in and unleash the full potential of your content by adopting these best practices in document management!",
