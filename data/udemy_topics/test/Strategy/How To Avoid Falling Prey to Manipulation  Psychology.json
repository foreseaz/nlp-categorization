    "description": "<p>Why do we make the same mistakes over and over again. You are losing in places you don't even know. Let me tell you, it is not your fault. Our brain is programmed in a way that makes us go wrong again and again without us realizing. What is it that makes you click the buy button or toss into your cart that you realize you never needed. Learn what our parents should have taught as early as they could and change your decision making and save on every deal you ever make. </p><p>Think about what happens if you decide against this inexpensive but very valuable course. You may be tricked by marketers, real estate agents, office workers...What is the possibility this will change your life: astronomical. What does it cost next to nothing (cup of coffee for a week). </p><p>You will learn how to recognize and evade manipulative weapons of influence. We make about 35,000 decisions a day and use mental shortcuts (called \"heuristics\") to make them without much thought. But, there is a huge downside to these pre-programmed responses. They can be used by others to push our decisions into their favor. Here are some of these cognitive biases we will be learning about:<br></p><ul><li>Scarcity Bias - a false urgency is created to rush your decision</li><li>Liking Bias - the face you cannot forget</li><li>Authority Bias - listening to the man above (more experienced people influence us)</li><li>Consistency Bias - how your believes can be slowly and steadily changed</li></ul><p>Think about how many of the above biases have been present in your day to day life. Maybe you cannot find many examples. That is because they work \"under the radar\" and can often be overlooked when we reevaluate our decisions (this, by the way, is another bias called denial where we want to \"forget\" our mistakes).</p><p>If you wish to not make big decisions in your life that you will regret, this course is for you. Remember, think about what you might be missing if you decline the offer to take this course. Next time you are in a negotiation, business deal, or a social event, you may make the wrong decision...</p>",
