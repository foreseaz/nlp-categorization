    "description": "<p>This course will provide a foundation for anyone who is interested in the Private Investigation industry. After countless job interviews of prospective investigators and peace officers I decided to help answer that one question that is on every oral board or job interview that everyone struggles with……..”<em style=\"\">What have you done to prepare yourself for this interview?”</em> This course will not only prepare you for a job interview in the investigative field, but it will equip you with the knowledge necessary to step out and begin to perform workers&#039; compensation investigations in a 500 BILLION dollar industry.</p><p>This course is primarily tailored for workers&#039; compensation investigations mainly due to the large demand from insurance companies for suitable investigators. Many of the investigative tips translate to all areas of private investigation. This course covers the following topics: Basics of Surveillance, Equipment, Report Writing, Stationary Surveillance, Mobile Surveillance and Personal Safety. This course is taught through the use of the written lectures, videos and at the conclusion of the material a knowledge test is administered. The videos in this course will demonstrate where to position your surveillance vehicle, how to “black out” and various equipment that is needed to perform these investigations. I take you behind the scenes and inside the surveillance vehicle. </p><p>A course completion certificate will be awarded upon successful completion of this course. This certificate can be used for 8 hours of educational credit towards the student&#039;s individual private investigator license. Student who take this course will also be able to more effectively obtain stationary surveillance video, covert video of claimants as well as have a general knowledge on writing an investigative report for workers&#039; compensation investigations. Students who elect to enroll in this course will also be awarded priority for additional training at a lower cost and receive free informational updates with regard to the Private Investigation industry. </p>",
