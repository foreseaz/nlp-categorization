    "description": "<p>Standards alone do not boost the quality of a child care program.  Consistent, appropriate, effective practice and assessment go a long way to increase the level of quality a program provides.</p><p>Join me as we take a serious look at the partnership between standards, practice, and assessment.  We will discuss, in broad terms, the ways in which each component supports or hinders quality.  We will design a bullet-proof self-assessment questionnaire that you cannot fail.  Finally, we will discover how powerful personality and learning styles are at influencing our judgement of best practice. </p><p>Intended for Level 2 (skilled) and Level 3 (Mastery) early childhood professionals.
