IELTS test-takers all have a remarkable goal – to migrate overseas for study or work – <strong style=\"\">and this makes them generally well motivated and easy to teach</strong>. It may be said that IELTS teachers have an easier time than their English teacher colleagues teaching young learners or busy professionals.<br style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\">IELTS is designed to assess English language skills at all levels - you cannot fail an IELTS test, as it is not designed to test at a particular level . Test takers receive IELTS scores based on each for the four skills (Readıng. Writing, Listening and Speaking) on a scale of 1 – 9, as well as an overall band score. You can score whole (e.g. 5.0, 6.0, 7.0) or half (e.g. 5.5., 6.5, 7.5) bands in each part of the test. </p><p style=\"\">The test is pen and paper-based and the Speaking component is face-to-face with a certified Examiner.</p><p style=\"\">IELTS does not test one particular version of English, such as British or American – it is a test of international English, reflecting the variety of sources that learners have access to and the range of English varieties to which they are exposed. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">The aim of this course is</strong> to prepare newcomers for teaching IELTS exam classes and to provide teaching solutions to those who are already teaching IELTS exam classes.</p><p style=\"\">So...<strong style=\"\">Welcome on Board!
