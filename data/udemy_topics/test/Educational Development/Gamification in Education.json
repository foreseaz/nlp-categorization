    "description": "<p style=\"\">In today&#039;s classroom, educators are constantly required to mold their teaching methods to give students the best opportunity to succeed. It is not only imperative for students to learn the required material, but also critical that students gain a sense of confidence toward their work, and find motivation to expand their learning.</p><p style=\"\">This can be difficult for some students. For some students, finding the motivation to complete homework or prepare for class can be a constant struggle, especially when every effort is met with a poor grade or frustration from teachers and parents. Therefore, teachers must become more and more creative when motivating students to learn. With this course, you will be given practical ways to engage your students through the use of a gamified learning environment along with some great technological tools as well.</p>",
