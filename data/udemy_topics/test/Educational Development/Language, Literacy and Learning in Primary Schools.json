    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t This course, based on Dr. Adekola&#039;s book of the same name, focuses on factors that are responsible for low learning outcomes and requirements for improvement in Nigeria primary schools. The course discusses three important conclusions from the research:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t (1) Teachers&#039; performance needs to be improved through effective teaching and operationalization of the Nigeria education language policy in the classroom.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t (2) Teacher preparation needs to be improved or overhauled particularly at the primary level so as to help children learn effectively; and teachers should be given more opportunities for additional in-service training or incentives ti improve their teaching performance.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t (3) An incentive systems needs to be put in place that rewards performance as measured by what teacher know and able to do in classroom and one that demands a higher level of performance in the classroom as a result of having attained higher qualifications.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t In a nutshell, this course identifies major shortcomings in teaching practices that impact student learning. It suggests strategies for reform of teacher professional development that would begin to address inadequacy of teaching and learning.  </p>",
