Do you often wonder if it's a regular or irregular verb?</p><p>Is this really annoying you?</p><p>Then this course is going to help you! </p><p>In this course we will only look at German verbs in the present tense and we'll cover the following verbs:</p><ul><li>regular verbs</li><li>irregular verbs</li><li>separable verbs</li><li>inseparable verbs</li><li>verbs that can be separable &amp; inseparable</li><li>reflexive verbs</li><li>impersonal verbs</li><li>modal verbs</li><li>the imperative</li><li>and new verbs</li></ul><p>This course is not necessarily designed for you to work your way through.</p><p>if you are a beginner following a textbook, then follow this course as and when you cover things in your book. For example, when you start learning about regular verbs, then watch the regular verb videos and don't worry about anything else. Watch the next videos when you have come across those verbs in your book.</p><p>If, however, you are a beginner AND a grammar geek, who wants to know about grammar, then go ahead and watch all the videos one after another</p><p>If you are an intermediate or advanced student, then either watch all the videos to revise what you have already learned, or pick those chapter that you are struggling with.</p><p>It doesn't matter how quickly you complete the course - it isn't a race - the important bit is that you can conjugate verbs in the present tense!</p><p>At the end of the course you will have a better understanding of German verbs in the present tense which will make life a lot easier when you learn the other German tenses.</p>",
