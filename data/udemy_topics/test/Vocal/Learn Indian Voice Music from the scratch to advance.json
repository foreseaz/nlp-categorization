    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t     The course is about <strong style=\"\">Indian voice music</strong>, where one can learn music of India. Initially, I will be covering Indian Classical Music, which is the root of all Indian Music. One needs to have an Indian drone-instrument called Tanpura and a Tabla, which is an Indian Percussion for creating beats. An iTabla-pro app (in apple products) connected with speakers is also sufficient for self-practices and sessions. The course is seven weeks long.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Classical music is classified into four groups:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Voice-production training.</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Indian note-syllables training(<em style=\"\">SWARA)</em>. </li>  \t<li style=\"\">knowledge about Indian beats-rhythms(<em style=\"\">TAAL).</em>  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Raga</em>-improvisation.</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t     There are a plethora of Indian music lovers in all parts of the world. Ample of audience gather for any Indian classical concert, but conceptualizing &#039;what is Indian Classical&#039; and its proper training is still lacking its persistence. I know many westerner-musicians, who travel to India annually for several months, leaving their jobs, to get guidance from their gurus. Therefore, one should definitely take this course to make Indian music singing and training-steps more accessible and approachable at any time.</p>",
