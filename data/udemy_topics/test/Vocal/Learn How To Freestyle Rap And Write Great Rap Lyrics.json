is the only proven freestyle method that has a 100% success rate with 100's of students.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I accidentally came up with the 4 step process in college when a girl in my co-op asked how she could start freestyling...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We went through 4 simple small steps to make sure she was successful and it worked...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>She ended up freestyle rapping better than I did my first time...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Since then...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've been teaching college, high school and elementary school students how to rap for over ten years and I'm super excited to finally release this freestyle rap method to the world...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I used the songwriting skills taught in this course to make <strong>100's of hiphop, r&amp;b and rock</strong> music songs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When I was 16 I asked my friend Mark to teach me how to rap and he gave me<strong> two golden rules...</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> When starting out don't worry about rhyming</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>and...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. </strong>Don't stop if you mess up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>These two golden rules and Marks' encouragement got me to start freestyle rapping which led me to writing 100's of songs and opening me up to <strong>express</strong> myself <strong>creatively in all forms</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, if you can just follow these two rules then you don't need this course.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I've added <strong>four more magic steps</strong> to these two golden rules, and a lot of <strong>advanced rap and songwriting training</strong> as a bonus to make it easier for people to start freestyle rapping fast.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And If you would like some extra support to get started and get access to the 4 magic steps that have now taught over 1,247 people how freestyle rap with a 100% success rate...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>...then this course is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Freestyle rapping has been such <strong>an amazing songwriting tool </strong>for me and I credit it for helping me open up to writing folk, guitar, electronic and hip hop songs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In college, whenever I was feeling down about girls not liking me, my friends and I would just get together around our dj homies (Dj Phatrick) turn tables and start freestyling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It always helped me laugh at myself and about the situations I got myself into.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing like the immediate release of emotion that comes with the ability to freestyle rap.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>With freestyle rapping the more vulnerable and honest you can be, the more healing and release you will get from the practice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I went from being a super insecure, severely depressed, sweaty palm nerd, to a confident, friendly and smooth nerd because of freestyle rapping.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for checking out my course and I sincerely hope it helps you.</p>\n\n<p>Humbled to be able to say that this course is the number one rap course on Udemy for 3
