    "description": "<p>\"Breathing easily and fully is one of the basic pleasures of being alive.\" - Alexander Lowen, The Voice of the Body</p><p>Breathing is an important part of our lives that we often overlook. Especially in regards to the diaphragm, which can go virtually unnoticed and unused to the non-trained vocalist.  This course provides a blueprint for an empowering daily breathing practice which aides in strengthening your diaphragm in order to achieve a fully supported and developed voice.</p><p>The course is made up of a collection of body movements which allow you to check in with your body and your breath to improve all aspects of your performance. At first you will be following the course as it's broken down into seven segmented moves and individual lectures. After running through the course once or twice and physically participating in the movements, you will then be ready to go through the third section which will provide an unbroken version of the course.</p><p>After you experience the entire practice a few times you will have easily committed it to memory. At that point, you will have developed a personal breathing practice which you can apply to many aspects of your life. Whether you're seeking to improve your singing, acting, athletic performance, public speaking prowess or for your own mediation enhancement.</p><p>At the core, this is a powerful meditation practice, which is important to the lives of many top performing athletes, dancers, actors and CEOs. Emotional intelligence is the foundation of leadership, so cultivating a meditation practice is crucial for top performers.</p><p>The technique is an amalgamation from a collection of expert's ideas such as Kristin Linklater, Alexander Technique, Yoga, meditation and Giana's personal experiences.</p><p>\"I felt relaxed, satisfied and content. As a leader of yoga and a school teacher, this practice has continued to help me to be more confident and comfortable in my role. I even feel taller\" - Danielle Redlin</p><p>The course was developed when a friend of Giana's had asked for help in rediscovering her original work. She had been singing the same songs for years but had lost touch with the music. The meaning of the song and the performance felt stale. As Giana and her friend worked through the meaning of the song and maintained a powerful meditation process, they identified where the love for the music was stored in her body and released it.</p>",
