As you work your way through this course focused on getting the best from a raw, unprocessed vocal recording, you'll discover quite a few different professional techniques that, as you progress, combine so, that at the end, you have optimised the raw vocal performance and made it ready to be imported into a digital audio workstation as a complete professional vocal recording, Once you have optimised the raw vocal performance, you will be in a better position to start utilising it as the main lead vocal performance that drives your song. </p>",
