So why not use a song to practice instead? That is exactly what we will be doing in this course. We will learn and practice different singing techniques using a song.<br></p><p>Welcome to the <strong>musendo</strong> singing series. We use a simple but effective process by which you will learn a technique, then we will practice it along with you to building a strong foundation. All of the teaching materials for our lessons were created by leading music pedagogues based off of curriculum used by the Sibelius Academy and other Finnish university music programs.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will develop a better understanding of various singing techniques that you can apply to your favorite song. You will also learn to develop better breathing and support, as well as learn to practice in a smart and healthy way. Let's get singing!<br><br></p>",
