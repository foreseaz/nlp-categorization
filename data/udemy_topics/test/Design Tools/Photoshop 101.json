    "description": "<p>Taught by photographer/visual arts teacher Scott Wittenburg, Photoshop 101 is a course specifically designed for those students with little or no experience in Adobe Photoshop who wish to become proficient in the program in a relatively short time. Beginning with simple, easy to follow video tutorials and supplied images, students immediately find themselves engaged in the course, creating composite images while becoming familiar with the tools. Through continued practice and usage, students eventually move on to creating their own original artworks by utilizing their new skills with their own images. By the end of the course, students will be able to tackle the following digital imaging situations with confidence, efficiency, and creativity.</p>    <table width=\"568\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\" style=\"\">  <tbody style=\"\">  \t<tr style=\"\">  \t\t<td width=\"225\" style=\"\">  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Retouching Images</li>  \t<li>Working With Layers</li>  \t<li>Working With Masks</li>  \t<li>Color Correction</li>  \t<li class=\"current\">Exposure Correction</li>  </ul></td>    \t\t<td width=\"281\" style=\"\">  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Working With Text</li>  \t<li>Working With Filters</li>  \t<li>Colorizing Grayscale Images</li>  \t<li>Creating Muliple Image Composites</li>  \t<li>Refining Edges, Feathering Images</li>  </ul></td>  \t</tr>  </tbody>  </table>",
