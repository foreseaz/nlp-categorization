All the fancy renderings you see out there on the internet are processed in some way, usually Photoshop.  Photoshop can be just as complicated to master as the 3d software, but it is equally as important for a striking image.  </p>  <p>  \t  Follow me in this course, and you will get all my techniques for processing a 3d image. The course structure follows 4 major sections, all of them building upon each other.  They are:  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Basic processing of an image</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li>setting up your renderings to give you the right channels / render elements </li>  \t<li>creating perfect selection sets</li>  \t<li>using render channels to enhance your scene</li>  \t<li>basic Photoshop adjustments</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Advanced Compositing</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><strong></strong>use raw 32 bit render channels to composite a rendering from different elements</li>  \t<li>learn to have complete control over lighting in post</li>  \t<li>change your day rendering to night</li>  \t<li>turn off the sun in post</li>  \t<li>continue with a non-destructive workflow</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Composite In Cutouts</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><strong></strong>learn to make people and other objects fit seamlessly into your scene</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t<strong>Final Touches</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><strong></strong>this is where I teach you everything I know to enhance your scene</li>  </ul>  <p>  \t  If you are looking to take your rendering skills to the next level, this course is for you!
