    "description": "<p>  \tThis VTC QuickStart! course introduces you to Adobe&#039;s recently released Muse, which now fully integrates into their creative cloud. As author and expert Mark Struthers guides you through the Muse UI, you&#039;ll see how the program is split into various modes dependent on the task required. You will learn how to incorporate Master Pages and sub Master Pages to help your workflow. Mark will also demonstrate how to use backgrounds and add content to individual pages. As the course closes, you&#039;ll see how to upload your finished site either to a host of your choice or to Adobe&#039;s Business Catalyst. The Muse wireframe used in this course is included as a work file so that you may continue to build on it. This title is a self-paced software training course delivered via pre-recorded video. We do not provide additional information outside of the posted content.  </p>",
