Final Cut Pro X should be much more accessible to “pro-sumer” videographers, many of whom shoot video with their digital SLR cameras. This video is geared to this new audience, taking them through the fundamentals of video editing, as well as how to get going quickly with Final Cut Pro X, which still is an advanced, pro-level application. Experienced instructor Joseph Linaschke presents up to four hours of high-quality HD video, complete with lesson files to practice freshly gained knowledge. </span><br style=\"\"></h5><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"></p>  ",
