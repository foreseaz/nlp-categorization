This course goes in detail over the reflection process in DCC application and how to tweak the results to get a life like results.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t The course will go over how to achieve textured reflections, reflection blending to simulate life like materials like ceramic, porcelain and metal and ultimately have full control of the desired look of your rendering.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t The course is only an hour long and requires no assets beside two spheres and a grid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t Happy rendering!\r\n</p>",
