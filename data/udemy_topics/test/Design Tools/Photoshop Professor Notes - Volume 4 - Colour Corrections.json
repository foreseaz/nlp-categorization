    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Photoshop Professor Notes - Volume 4</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Colour Corrections and Dynamic Range ...</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This is Volume 4 of 5 in my “Photoshop - Beginners to Intermediate” series. I have developed this series over many years of teaching at both the College and University levels in a variety of departments including the Multimedia Program, Graphic Design Program, the Fashion Program, and the Creative Photography Programs both daytime and evening diploma and certificate programs. These courses in Adobe Photoshop (Volumes 1 through 5), start right at the very beginning assuming that the learner has no experience in using the application.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Lecture 1: Understanding Auto Tone, Auto Contrast and Auto Colour</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This lecture introduces the basic “Auto” image correction features available in Photoshop and compares and contrasts them with an explanation of what each are doing.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Lecture 2: The Colour Balance Feature and Hue/Saturation</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      There are many ways, methods and features in photoshop that allow you to change colours in your image. In this lecture we discuss two of the most commonly used approaches and in using them as adjustment layers, we can always go back and make any changes we feel are necessary.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Lecture 3: Using Photo Filters</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This approach to changing colours is one of the forgotten methods. Using actual Photo Filters over a camera’s lens was one of the only ways film photographers could change colours in their images with out getting into the colour darkroom. Not many went into a colour darkroom and left that task to the darkroom technicians.  </p>  <p>  \t      Also, using these filters over a lens affected the entire image whereas in Photoshop with the use of Adjustment layers, we can affect certain ares of our image and leave the rest unchanged.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Lecture 4: Using Levels, Colour Balance and Hue/Saturation</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      In this lecture we use a variety of approaches on images to make colour changes to our images in order to enhance them so the look more like what our mind’s eye saw when we first thought about taking the image in the first place.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Lecture 5: Using Levels to Adjust Mid-Tones</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t      This lecture adds to all of the previous methods and techniques discussed. Adjusting the mid-tones to either lighten or darken the individual red, green or blue channels or components of an image can make some amazing results.  </p>",
