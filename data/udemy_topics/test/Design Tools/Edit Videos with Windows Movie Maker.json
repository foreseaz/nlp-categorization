    "description": "<p>Windows Movie Maker is a free video editing program for Windows computers. It's a popular option because of how easy it is to use! It may not be the best free video editor, but it's great for people who have older computers that may not be able to handle the more powerful editors.</p><p>The best part of this course is that I'll give you all of the sample files (unedited video file, background music, sound effect, and text file) and actually edit a video with you! It's a lot of fun and it's a very practical way to learn the program.</p><p>I edit my videos so that there's no fumbling through menus and no \"ums\" or wasted space. Why watch a 20 minute video when I could teach you the same thing in 5? Watch the \"Free Preview\" to see what I mean!</p>",
