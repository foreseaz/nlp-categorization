    "description": "<p>Your ideas matter. But can you share them? This course will teach you how to share ideas you have for iOS, Android and web applications using two tools: Sketch 3 and invision.</p><p>Sketch 3 is the future of designing web and mobile applications. Professional designers at innovative companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter have already made the switch. Yet because Sketch 3 is so much easier to learn than old design tools like Photoshop, people who have no design experience and have certainly never used software like Photoshop are learning to share their ideas just like cutting-edge professional designers.</p><p>Learn the fundamentals of this powerful tool and the industry-leading prototyping tool called invision in less time than it takes to go to the movies. At the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation of how to use Sketch 3 and invision, a clear sense of best practices to design quickly and well, and know exactly where to go to keep learning. Your ideas matter. Learn how to share them.</p><p></p>",
