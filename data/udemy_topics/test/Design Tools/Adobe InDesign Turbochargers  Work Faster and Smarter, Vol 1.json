    "description": "<p>  \t  You know InDesign, but you want to get faster. You want your hands to move your mouse and fly over your keyboard as quickly as your mind is coming up with ideas. Sound familiar? Well, then, this course is for you! We&rsquo;ll work on getting repetitious tasks done quickly, so you can spend more time solving the creative problem.  </p>  <p>  \t  The pace is fast, and it&rsquo;s assumed that you already know the fundamentals, so if you&rsquo;re new to InDesign, you&rsquo;ll need to have them down before you start. The prerequisite knowledge is covered in my course, <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/intro-to-adobe-indesign/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intro to Adobe InDesign</a>. No matter what your skill level is, if you find you&rsquo;re falling behind in a lecture, watch it at least once, and familiarize yourself with the techniques until you feel comfortable enough to work along.  </p>  <p>  \t  The lessons will be shown in Mac OS, but if you&rsquo;re a PC user, everything inside InDesign will essentially be the same.  </p>",
