    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t      Have you ever wanted to paint nature scenes from your imagination without directly copying a photo? My in-depth digital painting course will teach you how to master the art of creating landscapes with Corel Painter. This course features 4 different hands on projects. -- Sunset Sky, Thunderstorm, Starry Desert and Jungle Waterfall. Each lesson is about an hour long.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t      Discover advanced painting techniques like underpainting and glazing which were popular among classical painters. Modern techniques will also be explored, like painting repeating objects with a custom Image Hose Nozzle and using layers to compose your paintings. Each lesson starts with a warm-up video which will help you memorize observations about how each landscape element looks in real life. Next, we&#039;ll use those observations to create a digital painting from start to finish. As I paint, I will be describing my process step by step. I make it easy to follow along by highlighting each important step and showing a view of my hand while I paint on my Wacom Cintiq 24HD tablet.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t      Included in this course is a custom Corel Painter workspace which contains all of the brushes and tools required to paint along with the lessons. This course is compatible with Corel Painter 2015 and Painter X3. Once you have completed this course, you will have the skills to create your own landscape paintings from imagination.  </p>",
