    "description": "<p>HTML 5 is the leading web development language nowadays. Those days are gone when HTML and CSS were enough to code a web page. Now the demand is high and though the competition. If you want to get a job in some IT company HTML 5 is one of the compulsory languages that every web development company expect from their employees. Or if you are a self-employed web developer then you are missing the world of innovation in HTML 5.<br>\t<br>\tWhat am I offering in this course? <br></p><p>There is a complete training of HTML 5 from Basic level to Advance level in this course. In the starting, at newbie level you will come to know about the basic elements we use in HTML and now in HTML 5. Then you will come to know what are the new elements in this new version of the language and what is their use and where to use them. Afterwards, you will come to know about developing your own shapes by writing few lines of code. Then we will move to advance level in which you will learn to embed audios and videos in a professional way without any script and plugin. At the end of the course there is extra section which is optional where you can learn about sockets and server sent events in a detailed way if you want to get deep in back end programming.</p><p>\tWhy should I buy this course? I could get this information on google also. You could get all the details of any thing on the google. But you can't get all the required and important stuff at one place only. I mean you can get a lot of websites from where you can learn HTML 5 for free. But trust me they are like reading a book. They only say the function of an element and they write a code on how it works. You will never get a practical knowledge. If you buy my course you can learn by watching me writing the codes and explaining the meaning of each and every line. Moreover if you stuck at any part of the course you have to post on various forums and then wait for the members to get a solution. But here, you have many other options. You could read our discussion threads to get your solution. You can start your own discussion thread, and I will be there to help you with the best option. You can even privately message or mail me with your difficulties and I am online most of the time, so you don't have to wait a lot to get the solution.<br></p>\n\n<p>\tYou can read the curriculum to know more about the topics covering in this course. Plus there is an option for all my students to get items on demand. You can simply write me and I will publish it for you. <br>\t<br>\tHope to see you inside.</p>",
