    "description": "<p>  \t       InDesign is the industry standard for print publishing, but did you know that you can use it for digital materials, too? Exporting to Interactive PDF format is one of the easiest ways to get working in the digital world. Explore the foundations of common interactive elements, like buttons and hyperlinks, and see how to add video content.  </p>  <p>  \t <em>Interactive PDFs with Adobe InDesign</em> is made up of several lessons from my larger course, <a href=\"http://www.udemy.com/designing-for-the-ipad/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Create Your Own iPad &amp; Android Publications</em></a>, which covers other topics, including design principles, Adobe DPS, and eBooks. <em>Interactive PDFs with Adobe InDesign</em> is for you if you know InDesign, and just want to get started exploring digital interactive materials.  </p>  <p>  \t       Download templates and lesson files if you want to follow along and re-create the examples shown in the video lectures. There&#039;s also an exercise that you can do to practice your skills once you&#039;ve completed the course, or work on as you watch the lectures, instead of recreating the exact examples shown.  </p>  <p>  \t Need to boost your InDesign skills?
