    "description": "<p>Hi I'm Marouane, welcome to my course on <strong>Photoshop for industrial designers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This is the second part</strong> in the Photoshop for Designers series and in this course we are going to cover how to sketch and render round objects in Photoshop using a digital sketching tablet such as a Wacom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also learn how to take an image of a texture of your choice and wrap it around any surface you like. This is extremely useful if you are rendering products in Photoshop and need to add specific textures to surfaces. It saves a ton of time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By the end of this course</strong>, if you decide to follow along you will have a sphere or a ball rendered in Photoshop with a texture added to it of your choice. </p>\n\n<p>I would love to see your textured ball uploaded in the Q&amp;A section of this course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is for you who are starting out with digital sketching or simply want to learn how you can use a tablet to design objects and products in Photoshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make sure you download Photoshop file that's attached in the first section of this course</strong><strong>.</strong> This way you can see the layer structure and how the shading is built up by opening up the file on your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also download my brush set inside the course if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your time! I will see you inside the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marouane</p>",
