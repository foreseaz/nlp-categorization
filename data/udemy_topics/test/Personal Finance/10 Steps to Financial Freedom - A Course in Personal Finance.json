    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    The <strong style=\"\">COURSE IS OPEN</strong>! I add new stuff regularly so keep an eye out (: the excel sheets have intuitive built-in formulas to help you quickly calculate your debt snowball, total expenses, interest costs, and loan amortization schedules.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t Please feel free to write me and ask any questions! I will be happy to customize sheets for you if your computer is giving you a rough time. They are in <strong style=\"\">excel</strong> format. I also have <strong style=\"\">numbers for mac</strong> versions if you&#039;d prefer to apple way! Just email and I will send them to you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">A little about me:</strong> I am a <em style=\"\">classic lifetime learner</em> and <em style=\"\">jack of all trades</em>. The fellas who podcast Freakonomics (Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt), Dave Ramsey, and Robert Kiyosaki (author of Rich Dad/Poor Dad) are my financial heroes.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       Near my mid-twenties, <em style=\"\">a concern</em> began to creep over me. I finished the degrees I sought to acquire, married, had my first child, and began to wonder about the future I was quickly approaching.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      It would be a future involving a <strong style=\"\">high debt-to-income ratio, one of minimum payments, murderous interest rates, tireless hours of work, and no savings.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       I could <strong style=\"\">NOT</strong> let this become my future. So I began researching, analyzing, and definitely obsessing over my finances. Our future is organized, bright, and now we have a plan that is <em style=\"\">easy to follow and even easier to maintain</em>. <br style=\"\">  \t <br style=\"\">  \t       I wish the same for you and yours. The best way to receive is to give and I hope to give the tools necessary to simplify the struggles associated with <strong style=\"\">developing a financial plan</strong>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     No gimmicks, no &quot;too good to be true&quot;, and no &quot;hacks&quot; to financial freedom. Just the tried and true methods that anyone can follow in a short amount of time.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course is a course designed for:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">An in depth look into your personal finances</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Paying off debt quickly using a Debt Snowball and THEN a Debt AVALANCHE</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Saving for Retirement</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Investing </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Finding sources of Passive Income</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Building your assets and reducing your liabilities</li>  </ul>",
