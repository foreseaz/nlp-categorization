I am committed to supporting you.</p><p>  \t<strong>Do you want to go from being confused and frustrated about taxes to doing them correctly and confidently?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tBefore serving my first client at H &amp; R Block, one of the biggest tax preparation companies, I had over 130 hours in class training and did tens of case studies. <strong>75% of my clients come back to me tax season after tax season.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tIn this course will explain tax preparation terms and concepts in plain English. You will get an opportunity to do a couple of case studies for practice, so by the end of my course doing your own taxes will be a walk in the park, may be even fun, like it is for me – like doing a piece puzzle.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>My course consists of screen cast videos</strong> (yes, you will see what I see on my screen!) <strong>and text lectures. </strong>We will go over income documents and expenses records. I will explain which tax benefits you get no questions asked, and which ones you need paperwork for.<strong> You will get to see the whole tax preparation process over my shoulder. </strong>We will talk about withholding – the most misunderstood topic of tax planning.  </p>  <p>  \tI created <strong><em>this course for married couples who want to save money by doing their taxes themselves</em></strong> rather than paying top dollar at the retailer.  </p>  <p>  \tIf that describes you, go ahead, enroll into my course, there is a 30 day money back guarantee.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Want a quick preview? There are a couple of lectures available for fee to help you decide.</strong></p><p>You have unlimited lifetime access to this course and when I add new lectures, it will be at no cost to you.
