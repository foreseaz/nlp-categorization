    "description": "<p>Epic fail when it comes to your money? Budgets are terrible, horrible, painful things that suck all the life and fun out of you. Until now. </p><p>Why aren't you good at money? Is it your math skills? Nope. Is it what you do for a living? Definitely not. Is how much you make? No. It all comes down to one thing:</p><p>Your money habits stink. Use this course to fix them. </p><p>First, you'll learn how the brain works and how habits run your life. Next you'll take a look at spending to formulate a plan for what's ahead, learning money tips along the way. Then, you'll build an awesome routine to set yourself up for success and integrate it into your life. Each lesson is bite-sized -- between 1 and 9 minutes -- so you can watch intently or listen while you walk the dog. The worksheets are designed to be done in 15 minutes. </p><p>This was designed for the financial train wrecks, the clueless, and the I've-tried-it-all-and-failed, not the over-achievers or the people that like math. Go at your own pace and transform yourself from a money-zero to a money-hero.</p>",
