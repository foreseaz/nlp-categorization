    "description": "<p>My course is aimed at English speakers who would like to learn basic Japanese Conversation. They do not require any prior knowledge of Japanese. I begin by teaching basic grammar so that students can quickly begin to construct their own sentences. Then I teach practical themes like greetings, counting, days of the week, colours, shapes, shopping, ordering and so on, and grammar: pronouns, particles such as 'wa' 'ga' 'no' 'de' and 'ni' , interrogative pronouns, adjectives, verbs, conjugated forms and so on. Each lesson is related to the former lesson, which enables learners to review and learn more. I frequently compare Japanese grammar to English grammar to avoid confusion. At the end of the course, students will be able to hold basic conversations in Japanese.</p>",
