    "description": "<p>Having an extra $5,000 of monthly income would improve anyone's life. As simple as that.</p><p>Owning a side business that generates this type of profit could be the difference between <em>achieving the financial freedom that would enable you to do what you love</em> vs being stuck with a 9:00 to 5:00 job. With <strong></strong><em><strong>over 2,500 students signing up to this course in the first 3 days</strong></em>, it is very clear this is important to most people. The good news is that you don't need to quit your job or be a single 20-something year old computer savvy to achieve this. It's actually <em><strong>quite simple</strong></em>, once you know how to do it.</p><p>Most people have struggled making money in the iOS App Store and Google Play in recent years due to the amount of competition. They spend time, energy and money developing an app but when they upload it the returns are nowhere near what they were expecting.</p><p>What if I told you there is another way? What if I told you that right now there is a small amount of very smart people that are making A LOT of money with <em>very minimum investment</em> by <em>approaching the app business differently</em>? What if I told you that in just four months you could be one of them simply by following a <em><strong>bulletproof step-by-step guide that has been tested time and time again and proven to work on every occasion</strong></em>, would you be interested in learning it?</p><p><strong>Well, if you are then look no further - This course will teach you how!</strong></p><p>This course is straight to the point and will provide you everything you need, no beating around the bush or repeating the same thing with different words. With an average of <em><strong>4.94 stars, over 100 '5-star' ratings</strong></em>, and ranked as one of the <strong></strong><em><strong>top selling courses in Entrepreneurship</strong></em><em></em><em></em> you can be confident that the content you are getting is first class. In 7 quality packed hours you will learn what the successful appreneur's mindset is and which is the strategy that you need to follow. This is an approach that for years has been developed, tested and perfected by the most successful app developers in the world. I have talked to them, listened to them and become one of them. And now it's your turn.</p><p>If you are willing to dedicate 20-25 hours a week, <strong><em>I can personally guarantee that in just 4 months you will be making at least $5,000 a month and working no more than 10 hours a week</em></strong>. </p><p>How can I be so sure? Well, I have been developing apps for almost 2 years now. Around 6 months ago, after a lot of research, trial-and-error and exploration, I finally came up with an app business model that seemed very profitable. I implemented it and in just 4 months I was making more than $6,000/month and putting in less than 10 hours of work a week. I have taught this strategy to other people since then and every single one has seen similar success.</p><p>But don't just listen to me, listen to what some of the <strong><em>3,700+ satisfied students in the course</em></strong> have said:</p><p>\"I have spent at least a few thousand on Udemy courses about app development, whether it be outsourcing or creating apps yourself. This is by far THE BEST course I have ever taken on Udemy and I am so happy that I came across it. I know it will be life changing. I have learned so much about outsourcing, marketing, ASO/SEO, etc. Diego doesn't just spout out information at you, he shows you each step required. He is also extremely motivational. If you're on the fence about buying this course, BUY IT! It will be the best decision you'll ever make. Thank you Diego for making this course! :)\"</p><p>- Dimitri Michalakis, 5/5 stars</p><p>\"For someone like me who is thinking to start designing app since some years and always stopped for lack of resources (mainly money to invest, a team and the knowledge), this course is a real revolution!!<br>Following these lessons I started to think to this business in a totally different way, meditating on all the possibilities I missed until now and how I can approach them in the next few months to make my dream a reality.<br>I always thought that I had to learn programming and mobile design, and that I had to find a great idea to invest month of my life on and... bla bla bla... all of these became huge obstacles in my mind.<br>Now I learned from Diego that I should focus on marketing and analysis (which are already two of my skills) and leave tech stuff to outsourced developers, starting with basic simple apps that could sell well today and maybe give me the cashflow to develop more complex apps tomorrow.<br>Thank you Diego for showing me the way!\"</p><p>- Enrico Frascati, 5/5 stars</p><p>\"I have been looking for a way to learn to create my own apps. Diego has shown me a way to do that without having to learn how to code or program. This course is very well designed and presented, and is for anyone wanting to learn how to create apps with or without any experience in app making. He gives lots of tips and suggestions from his own experiences and lots of resources for the students as well. Thank-you very much Diego :)\"</p><p>-  Harvey Stewart, 5/5 stars</p><p>Some of the things you will learn in this course are:</p><ol><li>The mindset of the successful appreneur</li><li>The strategy that will take you to guaranteed success</li><li>Organize yourself and your business</li><li>Come up with great, successful app ideas</li><li>Decide on a target audience and niche that is profitable</li><li>Outsource work cheaply so you can focus on the important things that make you money</li><li>Create and manage a team that works for you</li><li>How to best monetize your apps to significantly increase revenue</li><li>Access to a course on App Store Optimization in both the iOS App Store and Google Play</li><li>Market your apps for free and with very little effort</li><li>Manage your time, get motivated and fight procrastination</li><li><em>Bonus</em>: List of recommended articles and books for further readings; list of 100 app ideas</li></ol><p>And this is just a small sample of some of the things you will get from this course, by the end you will have everything you need to get started and become a truly successful appreneur.</p><p>No matter who you are, if you know how to program or not, if you are good with computers or not, if you are a teenager with no business experience or an experienced professional, what you will learn here will make you successful.</p><p>I am very passionate about teaching and <em><strong>I will personally respond to any questions you may have as you go through the course</strong></em>. DO NOT think that once you enroll you are on your own, the videos may last around 7 hours but the course keeps on going. Join the community, hear other students' success and share your own! I would love to hear from you.</p><p><em>Just think about this: The course is $249. That is around $14 or $15 a week for 4 months and in 4 months you will be earning around $1,250 a week from your app business. If that is not a good investment, I don't know what is. Plus, I am <strong>so confident in the quality of this course</strong> that if you do not get results in the first 30 days after you purchase it you will get <strong>all of your money back</strong>, no questions asked! So, what are you waiting for to get started? <strong>Enroll now</strong> and allow me to show you the way.</em></p><p>Thank you again for reading; I'm sure I will hear from you soon,</p><p>Diego Guajardo</p>",
