    "description": "<p>This course was designed for two types of people:</p><p>a) You're a video marketer who wants to spend less of your time in the edit suite</p><p>b) You're an  entrepreneur who has shot videos, or who wants to start using video, but who do not know how to edit or how to make the most of that process.</p><p>In order to successfully grow your business, you have to remove yourself from some of the \"technician\" tasks (tasks like filmmaking, editing, etc). Editing happens to be the easiest place to start.</p><p>This course was broken down into concise pieces so you can make the \nmost of your learning in about an hour and a half. I've used this \nexact same process I'm about to share with you so I could find video editors and expand my video \nproduction team. The result of learning this process of hiring online has \nallowed me to successfully manage $32,000 across multiple projects, in \nless than 60 days this past summer.<br></p><p><br></p><strong>Why you need this course:</strong><br><p>- I'm going to save you time by giving you the EXACT formula to use in your job postings, so you can magnetically attract your ideal editor.</p><p>- I'll also show you how to shortlist your applicants, and how to really make sure the person you hire is a winner.</p><p>- You'll get a bonus interview with my Go-To editor (I found her through Elance), where she shares what it's like on the other side of a job posting, as well as tips you can use to make sure your outsourced video editor can get your work done on time, efficiently, and on budget!</p><p><strong>Price:</strong></p><p>This course is currently priced at $97.</p><p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong></p><p>Udemy offers a 30 day money back guarantee! Take the course, at no risk to yourself, and if you find it's just not for you, or you don't learn how to magnetically attract a professional video editor, you can get your money back within 30 days!</p><p>No screwing around.</p><p>No funny business.<br></p>",
