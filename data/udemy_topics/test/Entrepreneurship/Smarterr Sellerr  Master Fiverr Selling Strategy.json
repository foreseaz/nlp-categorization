    "description": "<p>There's no shortage of advice to the Fiverr seller, but good advice is hard to find. You'll come across a lot of articles, eBooks and training programs which teach you how to post gigs and withdraw funds, but lack the strategy that's really necessary to make your gigs attractive to buyers in this highly-competitive marketplace! And then there are the \"flippers\" who want to sell you the secret to making your fortune on Fiverr, largely designed to generate a lot of enthusiasm over unworkable plans with deeply flawed assumptions.</p><p>Smarterr Sellerr is a little different. I've designed this course to help you get there faster by researching your market and asking the right questions so you can design more competitive gigs, make more money and use Fiverr as a launchpad for long-term, lucrative, do-what-you-love work.</p><p><strong>Master the strategy to sell more, earn more and fuel the future of your Fiverr business!</strong></p><ul><li>Build a Profile Which Establishes Instant Credibility</li><li>Research the Competition to Outsmart, Outperform and Outsell</li><li>Design High-Demand Gigs Which Earn Your More</li><li>Master Top Sales Strategies to Sell More and Sell Smarter</li><li>Fuel the Future of Your Business, On Fiverr and Beyond</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Make great money on and off Fiverr with smarter strategy.</strong></p><p>The vast majority of Fiverr sellers earn less than they would working for minimum wage at 7-11, but a few smarter sellers thrive on Fiverr and a handful grow their business to other platforms, serving a large base of clients and drawing on the talent of dozens of other sellers on Fiverr and other gig working sites. If there's something you love to do, Fiverr offers a platform to follow your calling and reach literally millions of potential buyers, but it takes more than hard work and passion to get there. <strong>I will teach you</strong> MBA-level strategy applied to Fiverr, so that you can serve more buyers, earn more per order and consistently deliver top quality.</p><p><strong>But beware!</strong> Smarterr Sellerr may be the most difficult Fiverr course on or off Udemy! Whereas a lot of Fiverr experts will cover the basics in two hours, we'll deep dive into the considerations, implications and decisions which successful contract workers need to fully grasp once they get serious about making money. Whether you're totally new to Fiverr or are looking to take your business to the next level, Smarterr Sellerr will help you gain a better understanding of the ever-changing demand for services on Fiverr, so that you can position yourself to serve your buyers far more effectively than your competitors. Once you've completed this <strong>eight-hour, workshop-style course</strong>, you'll be equipped not only to succeed on Fiverr, but to grow your business across multiple platforms, taking the greatest advantage of what each has to offer.</p>",
