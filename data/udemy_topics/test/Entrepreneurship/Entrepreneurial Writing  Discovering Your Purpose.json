    "description": "<p>\r\n\t  Before you begin writing, you must discover how you are wired (your personality), your heart (your passions), and your opportunities. This is the first part of a four-part process that will help you reach more people and make money through writing and blogging.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Part one: Discovering Your Purpose</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Part two: Identifying Your Process</li>\r\n\t<li>Part three: Creating Your Products</li>\r\n\t<li>Part four: Establishing Your Platform</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  In this course, you&#039;ll learn from Terry Hadaway, an author and writing coach with more than thirty books to his credit (many as a ghost writer). Terry has worked as an editor-in-chief at a publishing company and successfully self-published some of his own work. In addition, Terry has a PhD in Adult Education with experience teaching adult students in colleges and universities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  This course walks you through a process Dr. Hadaway created while writing his book, <em>Live Your Why</em>. The course includes a multimedia presentation, interactive workbook, summary quizzes, and follow-up assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  Each video segment lasts approximately 15-minutes and is coordinated with a fill-in-the-blank workbook. The course should be completed within one week if you invest 30-45 minutes per day in the course content and follow-up assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  You should consider taking this course if you&#039;ve ever considered writing or blogging as a way to expand your business or reach more people. The tips are based on more than 15 years of publishing and educational experience.\r\n</p>",
