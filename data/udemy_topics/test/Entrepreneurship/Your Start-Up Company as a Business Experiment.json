This\r\ncourse is over 2 hours of information on how to start a new business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most\r\nbusiness failures are caused, not by poor execution as commonly believed, but\r\nby poor strategy implemented from the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conventional\r\nwisdom of writing a business plan as the first step to starting a business is a\r\nmistake leading to a higher risk of business failure later on. In its place,\r\nthis course begins by introducing the<em>Concept\r\nPlan</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where\r\nbusiness plans are based on a lot of guesswork and pulling unsubstantiated\r\nnumbers out of thin air, the Concept Plans serve as a concrete question and\r\nanswer methodology to produce the answers you need.</p>\r\n<p>Concept\r\nPlans:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp; Quickly answer the question of what you\r\nthink you are going to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp; Encourage you to address the crucial\r\nunknowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp; Question your assumptions and ask how you’re\r\ngoing to test them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4)&nbsp; Identify the <em>what-if</em> or <em>only-if-this</em>\r\nscenarios that are the foundation of the plan. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\r\nConcept Plan is followed by learning how to demonstrate that a business is\r\nviable because until<em>proof of concept</em>is shown, your business is just an\r\nexperimental start-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next,\r\nyou&#039;ll learn how to <em>design and conduct\r\nbusiness experiments</em> because until you validate the assumptions in the\r\nconcept</p>\r\n\r\n<p>plan\r\nand turn all those unknown factors into known ones, your idea isn’t workable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This\r\nprogram takes the rigor and process of the scientific method and shows how to\r\napply it to starting a new business – a process and system for you to discover\r\nand determine what your new business really is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img width=\"152\" height=\"115\" src=\"file://localhost/Users/cozengokce/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image002.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here&#039;s exactly what you&#039;ll learn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chapter 1: Getting Started</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This\r\nchapter will introduce you to the concept plan and business experiments, and\r\nmost importantly, why a better way to start</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a\r\nbusiness is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chapter 2: The Concept Plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What\r\nis a concept plan and how to write it.
