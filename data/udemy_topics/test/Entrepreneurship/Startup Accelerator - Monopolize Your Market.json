If You Want To Transform Your Business And Build A Successful Enterprise That Runs On Cruise Control, Then You've Found the Right Course.</strong></p><p><strong>That's because you are about to discover a surefire system to have a successful business that can run on its own without you having to put in endless hours of grunt work.</strong></p><p>Imagine what it would be like if you could just jump off the merry-go-round that is your business. Just think of what it would be like to go through an entire day or week without having to put out fires. What if you could wake up in the morning feeling energized and ready to tackle whatever the day has to throw at you?<br></p><p>Best of all, think of what your life would be like if you weren't overwhelmed with a task list that seems to never end. </p><p>And best of all, imagine what it would feel like to be in <u>100% control</u>, satisfied and proud of what you have built and accomplished.</p><p>Sounds like a dream right? Well, for most people, it is. And that's because they are not really running a business, they are self-employed. And that is the wrong way to run a business.</p><p>And that is also because what you probably know about business is completely wrong and holding you back from being successful. </p><p><strong>Imagine if you could turn that all around, simply by taking one course.</strong></p><p>I am going to teach you about some of the greatest systems, models and business concepts ever created. They have all been used effectively to jump-start sales and profits. I'm not only going to teach you about them, I'm going to show you how you can effectively use them in your business right away. </p><p>I have spent years putting the data, research and ideas into practice. I have spent countless hours in dozens of boardrooms ironing out the details and best practices for all of the concepts contained in this course. I have also charged upwards of $3,000 for boot camps and seminars teaching business owners how to build a successful business model and put it into play. </p><p>I am now making this course available online for a fraction of that cost. The content is identical. The only difference is the lack of networking and interaction at live events.</p><p><strong>Here is what you'll get out of the course</strong></p><p>Remember, this is all practical instruction and advice to help you create a real business. All the information was curated from successful entrepreneurs, business owners and some of the most successful organizations in the world. All, in one course, focused on small business owners, aspiring entrepreneurs and new start-ups.</p><p><strong>Learn the most effective strategies you need to start implementing and thinking about right away:</strong></p><p>Forget the nonsense of “mission statements” and meaningless slogans. Those mean absolutely nothing to the people that matter most, your customers. Start putting in place the only strategies that have proven to be effective at building successful businesses.</p><p><strong>Discover how to monopolize your market and have competitors refer business to you:</strong></p><p>Stop trying to beat the competition. Develop your own market and not worry about dealing with any competition. Competing on price is the biggest killer of any business. </p><p><strong>Discover the best way to hire the right employees for the right positions:</strong></p><p>Forget resumes. They are nothing more than a one-page contact card that is probably filled with lies. I'll give you a tool that will make sure you know exactly who you are hiring and that they are perfect for the job. You can even use this tool on your current team to help make sure people are in the positions that help them become high-performing superstars.</p><p><strong>Learn how to market effectively and not blow money away on useless advertising:</strong></p><p>I'll show you the difference between advertising and real marketing and why traditional advertising is a money pit. I'll teach you tried and tested strategies that will make the phone ring off the hook and email inbox full with messages from ideal customers and leads.</p><p><strong>Implement fool-proof back-office operations so you don't have to monitor everyone:</strong></p><p>Once you have the ideal client, the perfect marketing plan and the right people at the helm of your ship, I'll show you how to set up your back office and training systems so that you don't have to spend countless hours training new staff or dealing with day-to-day issues.</p><p><strong>Once I give you all the pieces of the puzzle, we'll put it all together using an incredible tool that will help you build a direct roadmap to business success</strong></p><p>Without a doubt the greatest discovery that I have come across in my research and studies is a tool that is so valuable, that it can single-handedly transform the way you do business. This tool alone is worth the price of the course and I will show you how to piece everything I have taught you up to that point into a single, one page action plan that will be more detailed and useful than any business plan you or an expert can write.</p><p>How do I know this? Because it has happened right before my eyes with my own clients. One group laughed when I told them what I wanted to do. I asked them to give me 45 minutes of their time over lunch in the boardroom. We didn't come out until 6:00 that evening and then went well into the next day. </p><p>Take the plunge and start building your successful turn-key business right away.</p>",
