    "description": "<p>Leadership Skills – Master NLP and Become a Student Magnet</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong>Just imagine becoming the GO-TO instructor whose students are not \"just\" students, but fans hungrily waiting for your next course.</p><p>Just imagine you can DOUBLE your impact on your students by appearing even more magnetic, more attractive, more influential. </p><p>Don't you know<strong> instructors or teachers</strong> you just desperately want to study with, because you know deep down their content is pure gold? </p><p>Perhaps you even thought to yourself - they are just great and \"talented.\"</p><p>The truth might be, and usually is, quite the opposite. They study <strong>SECRET TECHNIQUES of VERBAL  and NON-VERBAL INFLUENCE. </strong>When the master them more and more people start listening, responding and being absolutely mesmerized by their presence.</p><p>This is what <strong>NLP</strong> or<strong> Neuro Lingustic Programming</strong> can do for You.<br></p><p>Unlike many guides on this subjects, what you are about to discover is not a jumped-up list of \n'useful phrases' that you can find elsewhere on the internet. </p><p>They are usually very superficial and don't really present with the depth you need to implement everything.<br></p><p>I won't tell you 'how to bend peoples' minds against their will within a minute'.'  Instead it is a unique, detailed step-by-step guide to \nbecoming truly magnetic in inspiring and show you how you can make it \"flow\" in your life as a trainer  so you can brighten up the room build your authority and shine.</p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>Think about what implications does it all have in terms of income, leadership and value.</em><br></p><p><strong>STEP-BY-STEP</strong></p><p><strong>I have been asked to train hundreds of businesses to help them ATTRACT more clients, SELL more and RETAIN their clients being paid thousands of dollars for the job showing them EXACTLY where to start and HOW to IMPLEMENT the PATTERNS and RE-SETTING their internal FRAMES of MIND. </strong></p><p>Most resources on NLP put very little to no emphasis on the key element I cover thoroughly in the course. This element totally SEPARATES good Instructors and Trainers from the EXQUISITE ones.<br><strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong>Is it possible?</strong> <br></p><p>Sure, and in this guide I will show you – in detail – everything you need to know. Things like:<br></p><ul><li>How to begin from scratch and quickly build your mind powers.</li><li>How to instantly copy the exact QUALITIES of the Instructor or thought Leader you admire</li><li>How to remove your internal blocks within days.</li><li>How to adjust your physiology to achieve the WOW Effect - Instant Authority</li><li>How to modulate your voice so that you appear mesmerizing like Barrack Obama or Bill Clinton (YES, we are conditioned to the voice patterns of Authority)</li><li>How to use SECRET influence patterns of Language and Intonation used by Martin Luther King or virtually 95% of the present day thought leaders and influencers</li><li>How to use the Power of Language patterns to start flipping the COIN and be seen as a person whose message and arguments REALLY stand.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>I even give you a list of words to avoid, words which others use and fail so that you can now erase them from your vocabulary (OR use them on purpose).</strong></p><p>I have removed all the Neuro Linguistic Jargon – no new words, everything is just plain and simple.<br></p><ul><li>We will look at different communication styles (and go into detail about it). </li><li>I will share with you the powerful concept of CLEAN LANGUAGE (a powerful concept used by the top salesforce of every big company - APPLE, VIRGINMEDIA, MICROSOFT to communicate choice)</li><li> Plus lots of tricks of the trade that save valuable time and mark you out as a real pro</li></ul><p><br></p>",
