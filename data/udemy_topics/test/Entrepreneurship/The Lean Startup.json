    "description": "<p><strong>Lean Startup</strong> is a new, field-tested philosophy that provides you with a toolset to minimize failure and increase your chances of success. Learn why hundreds of companies, from financial services companies like Wealthfront to social companies like IMVU to large corporations such as Intuit, are&nbsp;using this revolutionary technique.</p> <p>But what is Lean Startup, or more importantly, how do I implement Lean principles into my own company? Well, to answer that question, we&#039;ve brought in the Godfather of Lean Startup himself, Eric Ries. Not only has he written the book on &quot;The Lean Startup,&quot; but he has also now created THE course on Lean Startup.</p> <p>Eric brought in all of the leaders in the movement to talk to you about what lean startup is and how to implement it into your company. This course is the real deal - it&#039;s the most content you&#039;ll ever get on the Lean Startup in one place. More importantly, it is curated - Eric has personally taken the most important aspects of Lean Startup and condensed it into a single course. And then he added a few dozen case studies of it by including bonus material from the definitive conferences on the subject.</p>",
