    "description": "<p>  \t  The ProForma is a tool entrepreneurs can use to learn how to evaluate the viability of a business or business idea.  We&#039;ve taken the complexity of such a task and designed a business tool that anyone can use with just a little knowledge of a spreadsheet program.  </p>  <p>  \t  The course is divided into 8 video lessons and lasts about an hour.  We use a simple and very familiar business, one that&#039;s so simple, a child could run it and we show how to analyze the money-making potential of that business.  </p>  <p>  \t  The ProForma is the first step in the creation of any business.  This unique business tool gives you the ability to hammer the numbers, to make sure there is really something at the end of the rainbow.  Once there is potential, the numbers can be sprinkled throughout the business plan and executive summary.  If the numbers donâ€™t work, move on.  </p>",
