Always wishing you had more time and more money? Too busy to really think strategically about how to grow?If you are, then this course has been built for you! SLAPbootcamp will help you set a realistic 1 year financial goal (for sales and profit), identify your ideal client, define the best business development strategies, and build an Action Plan to hit your sales goals. This is not a business plan, a marketing plan, a sales plan, or a lead gen plan. No more fancy strategic plans that stay in a drawer gathering dust. SLAPbootcamp will help you figure out the best way to grow your business, and create an Action Plan to acquire new customers and stay focused over the next year.  </p>",
