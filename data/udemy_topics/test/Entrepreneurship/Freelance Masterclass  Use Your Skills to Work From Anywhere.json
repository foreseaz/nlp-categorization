Your instructors actually wrote this description on a amazing beach in Thailand, after having spent their morning scuba diving. </p><p>But their lives weren't always like this, both Ian and Jasper used to work in an office working a corporate job. Ian graduated from an Ivy League university, became a strategy consultant for Bain &amp; Company and earned his MBA before leading the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions team at eBay. Jasper started a career in finance after earning a Masters degree in Econometrics. He worked for Optiver, one of the largest proprietary trading firms in Europe and traded the major European and US stock markets. </p><p><strong>Course Overview</strong><br></p><p>Suitable for anyone who has the drive to start a freelancing career, this course contains 92 lectures and over four hours of video. <br></p><p>We start by teaching you on which platforms you can apply and monetize the skills that you've learned from your work experience, your education or from other Udemy courses. </p><p>We'll provide you with a step-by-step system that takes you through the process of starting your first gig on Fiverr. We then teach you exactly how to beat the competition by making your gig more attractive than the best selling gig in your category. <br></p><p>We'll teach you a little known strategy on Upwork to stand out from the competition and attract the clients that you want to work with. We show you how to build long term relationships with these clients instead of focusing on getting as many jobs as possible by competing on price. </p><p>Students completing the course will be able to start their freelancing career within weeks, if not within days. Complete with practical exercises, cheat sheets and to-do lists, the course will also give you the tools and knowledge to manage your life as a freelancer and make the switch from 9-to-5 to freelancing.<br></p>",
