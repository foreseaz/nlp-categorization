    "description": "<p>  \t    This course is a quick course (more like a mini-course) for entrepreneurs, or those that want to start a business soon.  </p>  <p>  \t    In the course I boil down 10+ years of experience as an entrepreneur. I&#039;ve had successful businesses ranging from freelance writer, jewelry &amp; accessory designer &amp; Etsy shop owner, web &amp; blog designer, business coach &amp; consultant and even more!  </p>  <p>  \t   I&#039;ve also worked with hundreds upon hundreds of entrepreneurs over the years that  struggle to build their businesses. There&#039;s so much to running a business. I can&#039;t actually make it <strong style=\"\">easy, </strong>but I can help you make it a whole lot <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">easier.</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    How?  </p>  <p>  \t    By accessing your strengths, but in a new &amp; innovative way. This isn&#039;t a long strengths and weaknesses test where the results sound cool, but don&#039;t have a whole lot of application.  </p>  <p>  \t    This is a <strong style=\"\">quick </strong>quiz (if you choose to take it, if not, you&#039;ll still get tons of value from this course.)  </p>  <p>  \t    There are also only 3 answers:  </p>  <p>  \t    1. Connector  </p>  <p>  \t    2. Creator  </p>  <p>  \t    3. Collaborator  </p>  <p>  \t    You&#039;ll also learn in the course why you actually need to use all 3 in various ways to grow your business with less time at your computer.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course will really help you if you dream of owning a successful online business, or want to be a laptop entrepreneur.  </p>  <p>  \t    No materials are necessary for this course, just a willingness to learn and a commitment to <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">play nice</em></strong> in the course community.  </p>  <p>  \t    ~Ashlee (Thurlow) Geheb  </p>",
