    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is about how to best open a restaurant. Should you franchise or do it alone or with a partner? We will also discuss the various topics related to the restaurant industry, including: How to Up-sell Customers; How to Create an Amazing menu; how to manage worker&#039;s comp. costs; how to hire and fire employees and specifically I will teach you what kind of questions to ask during job interviews. We will also discuss Restaurant marketing, strategic marketing, management, the POS system, how to find the best location and negotiate the lease with the landlord.</p><p style=\"\">Negotiation tactic are very important and one chapter will focus on this. The materials included here are from the upcoming book: Restaurant Marketing: The Secret is in the Sauce™ by Dikran Iskenderian  (copyright 2015). This will give you immense information and wisdom based on 4 years of research I have done for this book. I am qualified to teach this course because along with my family, I own and operate the famous Zankou Chicken® brand of restaurant throughout southern California. </p><p style=\"\">I assume you will need about 2 months of reading and study to finish this course. The way it is structured, I recommend taking each subject mater AS YOU NEED IT, since it is not based on chronology. I will be including an electronic version of my upcoming book in this series. It will be available to download for everyone who purchases this course. The course is structured according to each chapter, and I will take my time presenting each subject matter accordingly. I will also provide the text for each lecture, available for download. Some of these chapters will contain review questions you should answer and use for self-study.</p><p style=\"\">By the end of the course, you should have everything you need to help you open a restaurant business. I have also structured this course for those of you who may already own a restaurant but wish to make more money/ profits. It&#039;s also geared toward people in the restaurant industry who simply wish to learn more, excel, and succeed in climbing the economic ladder within their organization. I have spent over 1,200 hours creating this book and these materials. They are of high quality. I simply ask that you please not share them outside the community of users here, as the material is copyrighted. I will add a video once every 2 weeks, and add the text correspondingly. My goal is to constantly add new material throughout the year.</p><p style=\"\">Thank you for considering taking my course. God bless. </p>",
