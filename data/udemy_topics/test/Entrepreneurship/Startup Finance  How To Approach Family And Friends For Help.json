Yet if this process is not managed well, it can result in long term tension, unforgiveness and  heartaches.  </p>  <p>  \t  In reality, it does not need to be that way if certain guidelines are followed. This will ensure that emotional upheaval and disagreements are completely removed and individuals can enjoy good relations with family are friends whether or not the business works out  not. For surely, as we journey to success there are challenges to overcome.  </p>  <p>  \t  In my effort to help entrepreneurs obtain the funding they need and still keep their relationships I will cover the <strong style=\"\">following topics:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">Determining the type of finance being sought</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">Advantages of borrowing from family and friends</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">Disadvantages of borrowing from family and friends</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">General guidelines </strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">The Agreements to sign</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">The Business Plan to present</strong>  \t</p>  \t<p>  \t\t  -<strong style=\"\">What to think about</strong>  \t</p>  </ul>  <p>  \t  My hope is that as you embark on this course you use the information to raise the money you need and still keep all your relationships intact!  </p>",
