One of the number one questions I get as a web developer is how to become a web developer. <strong> WHERE DO I START? </strong> I designed this course to <strong>help. </strong>After discussing with a <strong>group of experienced web developers</strong> we came up with a list of how to accomplish becoming a web developer.  This course is that list, with resources and more.<br></p>\n\n<p>I created this content after a meeting with a group of <strong>successful professional web developers</strong> and asking them in detail the question, if they had to start from the beginning what would they do.
