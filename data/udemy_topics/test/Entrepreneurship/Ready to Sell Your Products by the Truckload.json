In this class, she learned how to write a “Wow Factor&quot; email that a retail buyer could not resist opening.  She heard back from this dream retail account within the hour.  After one meeting, she landed the largest purchase order she had ever received and her product is launching in 440 stores nationwide.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              As part of this program, you will receive the exact email template that Ann used to land this enormous account.
