    "description": "<p style=\"\">In this course you will learn about two important business concepts: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness is achieving important company objectives. Efficiency is doing it with as few resources as possible. Successful entrepreneurs are masters of efficiency – they have a real knack for finding and utilizing a host of resources other than money, mostly because no one will finance their new business venture. Banks won&#039;t lend money to early stage companies, and venture capitalists only fund proven business models that are ready to scale quickly.</p><p style=\"\">Thus, most entrepreneurs end up bootstrapping their business startup. Bootstrapping is basically self-funding – it is utilizing all the resources you have to quickly build a prototype and get it into the market. An important part of bootstrapping is creating and implementing low-cost sales and marketing strategies. The tactics presented in this lesson are creative ways to take a new product or service to market without spending a lot of money. We will review these strategies, and then create a plan for implementing some of them into your new enterprise. </p>",
