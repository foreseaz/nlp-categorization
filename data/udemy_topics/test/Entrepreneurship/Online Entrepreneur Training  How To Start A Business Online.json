    "description": "<p style=\"\">Have you ever heard of “the 4 hour workweek&quot;?</p><p style=\"\">Besides the book, the concept is really simple.</p><p style=\"\">Whatever it is you want to be doing with your time, what if you could actually do it…rather than trading that time for a job you really don&#039;t like…let alone love.</p><p style=\"\">Another way I see this is travel. If you&#039;re tied down all the time, not only is it physically impossible to be on the go and travelling the world…it&#039;s financially not feasible.</p><p style=\"\">Or maybe you have a hobby you really love and want to be totally free to just do.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps you are passionate about a lifestyle you want to live, or are a social justice warrior, or an artist, a poet, a writer.</p><p style=\"\">So there are the options of starting a “brick and morter&quot; business or a physical products business. But these are not always a viable option for people. The cost and headache involved…and if the product is not a hit, all that energy and money is spent…sure it&#039;s educational, but if money is limited and time is of the essence, this is not a great option at all.</p><p style=\"\">Then there&#039;s the “services&quot; industry, where you trade a service for money. Perhaps you are good at tree trimming or dog walking or computer work. You can charge for these services and then do them for people.</p><p style=\"\">But here the issue is quite simple…it&#039;s not the 4 hour work week! You literally have to trade your time for dollars.</p><p style=\"\">So this leaves an option that, in my opinion, is the best to get anyone started down this journey of creating a business that will pay them while they work less and less.</p><p style=\"\">There is still work and time involved in getting it started, but without the high risk, without locking yourself to trading time for dollars, and without the heavy up front cost.</p><p style=\"\">I&#039;m referring to information products. In fact, chances are you have purchased at least one info product this year, be it an ebook, a membership, a service, even a kindle book.</p><p style=\"\">What&#039;s brilliant about this form of business is you can spend your time up front, developing and creating your “product&quot; with very little money or no money at all…just your expertise.</p><p style=\"\">Then you spend time and maybe some money, marketing and getting it “out there&quot;, building your audience.</p><p style=\"\">And within, I&#039;d say safely 3 to 6 months, you have an online business that is growing, profiting, and most important of all…Allowing you to do what you WANT with your time.</p><p style=\"\">So don&#039;t just go quit your day job just yet…</p><strong style=\"\">Right Way vs. Wrong Way</strong><p style=\"\">There are Right and Wrong ways of doing an online business. A lot of wrong ways, and just a few right ways, to ensure you are successful and “get it&quot; the first go around.</p><p style=\"\">I teach the Right way, based on my own personal entrepreneurial experience over the past 12 years, of identifying, dreaming up, creating, producing, and selling your info product…your online business…in my new course.</p><p style=\"\">This course is entirely online now, although it&#039;s best followed as if you were at a 4 day training seminar. It contains 18 modules made up of 37 videos, all the tools and supplemental material needed, EVERYTHING you need to get started.</p><p style=\"\">So it&#039;s a complete training course that walks you through creating your online business for success. And along with it is my personal email support and the opportunity to do further coaching with me personally.</p><p style=\"\">Anyone can accomplish the 4 hour work week using this training. But it does require something. It takes focus and commitment and a “not going to quit&quot; attitude. I can teach everything else. But those qualities are up to you.</p><p style=\"\">Although I do talk about the principles of success and really lay it out to you, ultimately everyone&#039;s success lies in their own perspectives and hands.</p><p style=\"\">In my course I teach everything else. All that you need is desire and drive. I show you the rest of the entire process from what exactly you could do for an online business, how to identify a niche you would thrive in, all the way down to product creation, step by step and how to get it to customers, etc.</p><p style=\"\">Just think about this, in 6 months you can actually have an online business where you are providing a quality product that you worked hard to create, but don&#039;t have to keep working hard on every day. Something you put work into that then continues to pay you back.</p><p style=\"\">In 6 months you can be planning a vacation instead of sitting behind a desk under a flickering fluorescent.</p><strong style=\"\">What <em style=\"\">Is</em> Success?</strong><p style=\"\">There are many ways we define success. But in my experience as an entrepreneur for the past 12 years, I&#039;ve found that success always equals time reclaimed.</p><p style=\"\">You can have a steady flow of money, but if you are constantly having to trade your time for that money, you are a slave to it.</p><p style=\"\">Success is all about turning the tables on this and making money work for you, reclaiming your most valuable asset besides your mind…YOUR TIME!</p><p style=\"\">I&#039;ve put together many online training programs, courses, etc over the past 12 years, on many different techniques to make money online, on marketing, even on technical subjects like WordPress. But I consider this course to be the most important I&#039;ve ever made…for 2 main reasons.</p><p style=\"\">First of all, this course unlocks the mystery surrounding success online and empowers students with the training of the right way to go about creating a truly legit, profitable, sustainable and successful online business.</p><p style=\"\">It teaches you step by step exactly what successful online entrepreneurs are doing. Exactly the formulas, the setup, the layout of how to actually put together an online business and launch that business, begin marketing it, growing it, scaling it up and more.</p><p style=\"\">And second of all, this course is the accumulation of my 12 years as an entrepreneur. I&#039;ve started several successful online and offline ventures and have helped to launch successful online careers, consulted for firms and small businesses, and most importantly, I&#039;ve learned from many mistakes along the way. I&#039;ve learned the pitfalls. I&#039;ve learned what works and what doesn&#039;t. How to create a business that will actually work, actually succeed, actually profit.</p><p style=\"\">And I&#039;ve done my very best to deliver it to you throughout this 37 video training course.</p><p style=\"\">In a phrase, I show you how to turn your interests into a fun, profitable, sustainable and successful business that puts time back into your hands and allows you freedom to live the life you actually want to live.</p><strong style=\"\">About The Training Course</strong><p style=\"\">This training program is 18 modules with about 12.5 hours of video training in total. These videos are broken up throughout the modules, making it easy to navigate, easy to follow along, and broken up to help you digest the vast array of training I cover in this course.</p><p style=\"\">Along with the training videos, I provide regular updates, additions, supplemental material, and more all right here on Udemy. And, for a limited time, I&#039;m including personal Email support…with me personally, not farmed out.</p><p style=\"\">Before I share some of what you&#039;ll be learning, here&#039;s an outline of what you get as a new student of this training program:</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ 18 Modules</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>18 high quality, thorough modules containing everything in a clean and easy to navigate and follow layout and design…with your entire training and lifetime access. </p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ 37 Tutorial Videos Throughout</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>I spent over a month developing from my own expertise and 12 years of experience, failures, and successes a comprehensive, well organized and easy to follow video training course.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ Supplemental Section in Each Module…</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>containing: tools, templates, downloads, swipe files..lots of goodness..all relevant to that module and your business.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ Regular Updates to Every Module:</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>Any changes, added notes, or other important and relevant information for each module.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ Addendum Videos</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>Things I want to add down the road to enrich your training, new material, new videos, etc</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ Resource Section</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>with goodies and things related to the course at large, reading and more</p><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Plus These Bonuses:</em></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ + Members Only Forum! coming soon</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ + Email Support</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>With me personally, I don&#039;t farm out my training or my support!</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ + Limited Coaching Program</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>By application only I offer personal 1 on 1 coaching to qualifying members, for business coaching or technical coaching (where I do the geeky stuff for you)</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">★ + Webinars/Coaching Calls coming soon</strong></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\"></strong>Another cool thing I&#039;ll be adding soon is a monthly group call/webinar where you can ask me anything and we discuss any relevant topic</p><p style=\"\"></p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Here&#039;s just some of what I teach in this new training program:</strong></p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">How to actually create your own product or service designed around YOUR interests and passions</li><li style=\"\">The principles to a successful business – From my 12+ years as a business owner/entrepreneur</li><li style=\"\">Demystifying an online business, how a successful online business operates</li><li style=\"\">The steps to take to prepare before jumping in…from planning to outlines, to mindset, to getting focused on WHAT WORKS</li><li style=\"\">What to expect and getting your mindset right</li><li style=\"\">The keys to success in online or any business</li><li style=\"\">Extensive training and direction on finding your niche, taken from my own experience</li><li style=\"\">The steps to conducting effective research within a niche you&#039;ve selected following my detailed and highly effective approach</li><li style=\"\">What you&#039;ll need, tools, resources and more to prepare you for your business and for success</li><li style=\"\">How to design and map out your business, every aspect you should plan and design out and the steps involved.

But the reality is, about 99% of those systems are complete malarkey. They are designed to sell hope and deliver, not a business, but a gimmick that mostly annoys anyone who you try to sell it to.</p><p style=\"\">What I teach in this course is how to actually create a real online business, how to actually create your own product or service based on your passions and interests, and how to profit from and grow your business, setting up for the long run and having a sustainable online business that you are passionately behind but that&#039;s also setup for success because it&#039;s designed correctly.</p><p style=\"\">This is an educational course that delivers real results to serious entrepreneurs and is designed especially for beginner entrepreneurs.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Recent Reviews of My Training</strong></p><blockquote style=\"\">…Thank you so much for being a real person and reaching out through the WF.
