However the course is much more! It not only gives you a real world blueprint, it goes far beyond and explains everything step by step. This is not only encouraging - it is enlightning especially as it covers even tough topics like pricing, business models and the sales process. I enjoyed every video so far (85% through the course) and I'm looking forward to see the final lectures. I definitely recommend this course. Thanks.</li></ul><ul><li><span></span><strong>My Head Stopped Spinning - </strong>I have tried for a long time to grasp the total concept of explainer videos, how to get clients, how to rank on Google and get SEO down to a fine art. Usually with the end result being a spinning head and feeling of overwhelm. But no more, I am now well on the way to be the maven in my field, thanks to Robert and this course. It's brilliant - thank you for making this course...maybe I'll make an explainer video of how good it is.</li></ul><p>_________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE!!!: Included in this course - The ENTIRE CONTENT of Robert's \"How to Use YouTube to Rank #1 on Google - Over Night!\" - one of the most popular courses on Udemy!</strong></p><p>Just listen to the results other students have gotten with this popular course:</p><p><strong>  \t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Dr. Richard Feldhake </strong>had ZERO experience with Youtube, and couldn't even get his site ranked in Google….then he used my strategies to <strong>rank Page 1 of Google</strong><strong> 11 hours after posting his first video</strong>.
