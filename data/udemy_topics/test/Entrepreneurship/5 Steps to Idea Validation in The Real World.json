Your audience and customers are going to be real people, not imaginary. Many unknowingly validate ideas in their own head and overlook that they need real, hands-on feedback. This feedback helps you make better business decisions.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        In this course we outline exactly what you should do and how to do it. I’ll even give you a few tips on how to find your potential clients, as well as what exactly to say to them when you meet them for this exercise. With this feedback from potential customers, you will know if your idea is a good one, and if so, how to build the best version of it.<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t        You also get a neat workbook that goes along with the course!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">If The $100 MBA was the 90′s sitcom Seinfeld, this course would be like the character Kramer. Every episode, trying new things to see what works.</em>  </p>",
