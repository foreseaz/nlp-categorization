It’s a big word that is being used by a lot of people, many of whom have never really created a business, <em style=\"\">but would love to try</em>.  What holds them back from starting a business?  We believe the answer to this question has three parts.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tFirst, they fear failure.  An entrepreneur is someone who has learned to succeed by first failing in order to learn what doesn’t work.  Unless you are willing to risk failure, you are not willing to risk success.  An entrepreneur realistically considers the costs, but at the end of the day is willing to assume the risk of failure.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tSecond, people lack a realistic understanding of what entrepreneurship and starting a business is all about.  They think they need to learn about business – which they do.  But, they also need to learn about themselves.  This leads to the third and final reason why few people become entrepreneurs.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThird, they do not have a realistic understanding of who they are, their spiritual gifts, and the personality traits that makes them who they are.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\">The first key</em> to being a successful entrepreneur is to know WHY you want to have a business in the first place.  If you can’t answer this question – if you cannot identify what your passion is – then you will lack that all important self-motivational factor that keeps you moving forward despite seemingly overwhelming odds.  Clearly understanding WHY you want a business will provide you the intrinsic motivation you need to persist.  It will give you the reason to ACT to accomplish your goals, and it will motivate you to ACQUIRE the knowledge you need to act wisely.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Course Organization</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course is divided into four modules.  The first module, Why Have A Business, is designed to help you understand what is fueling a global trend toward self employment and new business start-ups.  In this lesson, we’ll explore these trends, and learn why they provide a reason for you to consider starting your own business – be it spare time, part time, or full time.  This module is subdivided into five lessons:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 1:  Why Have a Business  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 2:  Why Work is Going Online  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 3:  How Government Regulations Are Affecting Jobs  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 4:  The Advantage of Deducting Business Expenses  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 5:  Self Employment is Not for the Faint of Heart  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe second module, Creating Your Mastermind Group, is designed to teach you that to remain persistent for the long haul, you will need to surround yourself with a core group of advisers who will encourage you, and hold you accountable.  We will show you how to do this by forming a Mastermind Group.  This module is subdivided into the following 4 lessons:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 1:  Why Do People Fail?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 2:  Creating A Mastermind Group  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 3:  How Does A Mastermind Group Operate?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 4:  Leveraging the Power of a Virtual Mastermind  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe third module, What Business Structure is Best for You, introduces three basic business structures.  We provide you with the pros and cons of each, the types of forms you’ll need to file, and a comparison of the tax costs of each business type.  We’ll ask you to consider some very practical issues to help you evaluate which business format is best suited to your particular needs.  This module is subdivided into the following 4 lessons:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 1: Is Your Business Newborn, Reborn, or Clone?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 2: Choosing Your Business Structure  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 3: Filing as a Corporation  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tLesson 4: Tax Liability Comparison for Each Business Structure  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe fourth module, Next Steps, provides a bonus lesson: Ten Points to Remember when Starting a Business.  We’ll also conclude with some additional resources you can take advantage as you consider starting your own business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Lesson Materials</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tA total of 34 lessons divided between 5 course modules constitute the core of the learning materials.  Video lessons are recorded power point presentations converted to video designed to emphasize key learning objectives.   Additionally, each module is accompanied by an ebook (PDF) designed to round out the video presentations.  Each module begins with an introductory video that sets the stage for what you will learn in that session.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tDepending on the pace of the online learner, one should plan to spend about four hours going through the materials.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Why Take This Course</em></strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tGeneration Self Employed is dedicated to creating curriculum and coaching for the next generation of entrepreneurs.  We’ve developed a “learn by doing” curriculum that can be used by home school families, unemployed or underemployed adults, as well as older adults nearing retirement age, but who wish to start their own businesses.  We have developed and piloted a curriculum on entrepreneurship that not only helps people learn how to see themselves becoming entrepreneurs, but also gives them a step by step hands on program to learn and apply the principles of how to successfully launch a business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThis course, <strong style=\"\">Why Have a Business</strong><strong style=\"\">,</strong> is an introduction to that curriculum.  It is designed to help you understand the trends affecting the market place, why people who might want to start a business fail, and how you can equip yourself to succeed.  We provide an overview of the most often used business structures by new small businesses, and conclude with a list of ten points to remember when starting a business.  Finally, we provide a list of additional resources to help you get started with a new business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<em style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">About The Course Creator, David Lantz</strong></em>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Why Have a Business</strong> is the first in a course series titled &quot;Generation Self Employed.&quot; I&#039;ve worked with Scott Badger of Northpoint Homeschool Classes to develop and pilot a curriculum on entrepreneurship that not only helps people learn how to see themselves becoming entrepreneurs, but also gives them a step by step hands on program to learn and apply the principles of how to successfully launch a business.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI&#039;ve worked in the network marketing direct sales industry, building a downline of with over 170 independent representatives.
