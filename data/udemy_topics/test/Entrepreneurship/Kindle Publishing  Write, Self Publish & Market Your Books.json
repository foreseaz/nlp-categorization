    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">    How Would You Like to Become a Bestselling Author and Watch Your Passive Income Grow Each Month?  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    The cool thing about publishing books on Amazon, Nook, iBooks and the other platforms is that you only do the work ONCE!  </p>  <p>  \t    As a bestselling author myself, I know the huge power of self publishing books. In late 2012, I decided to try my hand at writing and publishing books on Amazon Kindle. I quickly built a fan base under one of my fiction pen names, and that pen name provides a large portion of my monthly income to this day.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">    But, here's the thing. You MUST get advice and training from someone who does this business every single day. Don't try to learn from wannabes or those who teach because they cannot DO.  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">    Every day, I write. I publish a book every 2-4 weeks. I edit, proofread, run my ghostwriting team. I interact and engage with my 9,000+ Facebook fans and the thousands of readers on my mailing list. I do everything I teach you in this course.  </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t    If you want to learn from someone who does, click to sign up for this course! I will be adding more to it over time, and I will be there in our private discussion area daily answering your questions and helping you in any way I can.  </p>  <p>  \t    Here is just some of what you'll learn:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Why self publish in the first place?</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">What genre to choose</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to research money-making genres/topics</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">How to outline for fiction and non-fiction</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Formatting basics</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Covers</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">Marketing and Promotion</strong></li>  \t<li><strong style=\"\">And much more!</strong></li>  </ul>  <p>  \t    When all is said and done, you will be ready to publish your first book!  </p>",
