    "description": "<p>We don’t always know what makes our own ideas valuable. Failed entrepreneurs are often very close to where they need to be to get the results they want. They just can’t see the bigger picture of how everything in their brand identity could fit together as one cohesive story. However, by being asked the right strategic questions, and forced to come up with meaningful answers, rapid progress can be made.</p>\n\n<p>In being so close to your own business, you forget what things look like to an outsider, and you can’t present your business in a way which will appeal to whatever they are specifically looking for. Nor can you identify the emotional personality elements which attract your specific group of consumers to want to work with someone like you. The goal of this module is to move beyond functional descriptions of what businesses do, and instead focus on the profound change they create in the lives of buyers. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These lectures will teach you to remove anything which does not immediately increase the perception of the value you have to deliver. You will simplify and refine to make the uniqueness of their value more obvious, so that their presentation of what they do successfully converts the customer’s emotions to pleasant ones that grab attention and make them want to buy.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve drilled down to these core elements of what makes their business work, it then becomes about rephrasing and re-engineering everything they've said in a more attractive way. The goal is to cut away all the clutter they’ve been distracting themselves with, and just get straight down to the parts that actually deliver value and reveal emotional character traits. What makes an identity and its accompanying story work is a lot more than just having a functioning product.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this module, we are going to focus on the steps you need to take to understand your own brand identity on an internal level, before we ever worry about crafting the perfect sales pitch or color scheme for your website. This means, among other things:\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>●      The specific problems your business exists to solve.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>●      How they are packaged together into physical things and actions called products and services.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>●      Both the experience of using your products and the end result of them.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>●      The personality of your company and the emotions you want your clients to associate with it.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>●      How your own enhanced perceptions of your company will change your actions and those of your entire team.\n\n \n\n \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the elements which come together to form your sense of identity as a solo professional or larger company. They define your place in the world, and they are living things which change with circumstance. Just like your identity as an individual, they respond to the new experiences you have with every passing day. They are not set-in-stone facts or points of data – but more like principles of change which ultimately determine how you respond to reality and the meaningful interactions you have in the world. \n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’ve taken the time to search within yourself and study the responses of the marketplace, you will have a solid foundation upon which to grow your brand. Let’s get started.</p>",
