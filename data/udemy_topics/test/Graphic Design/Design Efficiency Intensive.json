    "description": "<p>  \t<strong>    This intensive course is a cross-section of the Fluid Design methodology, which covers every aspect of graphic design efficiency,</strong> from Adobe CS/CC tricks to effective personal time and resource management. Career designers of all experience levels will benefit from the time- and energy-saving tools you&#039;ll learn about!  </p>  <p>  \t      Fluid Design was created by Whit Gurley, an equally lazy and anal retentive career designer who has been obsessed with the streamlining of design workflow for two decades. Whit&#039;s studio Angled End Identities has been building the brands of small and large clients since 2001.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>NOTE:</strong> The Fluid Design curriculum is largely <strong>Macintosh-based</strong>. While Windows-based designers will fine <em>plenty</em> of valuable info, a significant portion of the content discusses techniques and tools that are specific to OS X (though Windows counterparts can be found for most if not all of these).  </p>",
