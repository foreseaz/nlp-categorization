Is it even hard to draw a cartoon?</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You see other artists’ work and think, why can’t I draw my<br>figures like that? I used to feel the same way until I discovered the secrets<br>of figure drawing, and I’m going to share them with you.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Tim thought he would never be a concept artist because his figure<br>drawings weren’t good enough, but then he found my 10 hour course, and guess what?<br>He’s now a concept artist.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You too can draw the human figure like a master artist. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>“I want to help Neil because he helped me. I owe my job to<br>him. His teaching techniques and teaching style made everything finally click.<br>I just got it! I started drawing figures that looked good. What a great<br>feeling. Even if I never landed my dream career, just the feeling of drawing<br>great figures was worth every penny Neil charges. I can’t believe he offers so<br>much for so little.” – Tim. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t give up on yourself. You can draw people, and you<br>won’t believe how little it will cost you.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You want to draw for a living, or paint for a living, but<br>the human figure is holding you back, but it doesn’t have to anymore. After you<br>go through 10 hours of video containing my step-by-step drawing lessons and my<br>best-kept secrets, you’ll draw the human figure like never before! Guaranteed.<br>I mean that.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I can guarantee it because I’ve seen it work again and again<br>for my students. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You should see Kim’s before and after, but I don’t know how<br>to post that here. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>It worked for me. You should see how my figures used to look.<br>I almost gave up!</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Once the secrets of drawing the human figure clicked, I made<br>quick leaps. Would you believe that before and after was only 30 days after I<br>figured the secrets of figure drawing out? Yes. It’s true. It only takes some<br>two weeks. I want to repeat that because it’s so awesome.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn how to draw the human figure in two weeks!</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>What? Crazy, right? My students are evidence. I am evidence.<br>I’ve seen it work for me and others.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You just have to watch the videos and do the exercises.<br>That’s it.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You can have that dream job, drawing or painting.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You can make money<br>with your art.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>You can, you can, you can.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>But you’ve tried art courses? You read some figure drawing<br>books? You even paid for personal art lessons?</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Why will my course be any different? </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Because it is different. Why don’t figure drawing books tell<br>you how important it is to master the stick figure before you even start<br>drawing mannequins? Because not every artist is a great teacher. Most master<br>artists either don’t know or don’t remember what it takes to get to that level.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>They don’t know how to break down the step-by-step learning<br>process that is necessary for most people to draw the human figure like a pro.<br>That is what this course does for you. It turns you into a figure drawing professional.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I guarantee you will finally be happy with your figure<br>drawings once you complete Master the Human Figure that I will give your money<br>back if you aren’t. Of the 1,297 people that have bought the course so far, not<br>one of them has complained. Not one.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>But you won’t ever be able to draw the human figure? </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>If you can master the basic stick figure, you can draw the<br>human figure. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s true.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Students have told me I should charge $500 for this 10 hour<br>course Master the Human Figure. I don’t. I’m not even charging the normal $69<br>dollars.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>What am I charging then? You are probably ready to punch me.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>But why? Why would I do that?</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Because, I have no overhead, no electric bill to pay, no<br>office rent, no CD’s to produce, etc. I offer you the 10 hours as instant<br>streaming video, with fast servers. You can even download them. </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>“I had spent a lot of<br>money previously on books and classes however what i have learned from both<br>your Mastering the Human Figure and the Mastering the Human Head is incredible.<br>What i enjoy most of your courses is that you break down the *Formulas*, and i<br>really enjoy the fact that you are always stressinsg the importance of<br>practice, practice, practice. I went from being frustrated and stuck to excited<br>and motiviated. And thank you for making it soo affordable, THANK YOU...”–Orlando<br>Piedrahita, CA</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Why should I over charge you? It only cost like $100 to<br>produce a new, flat-screen TV, and they sell them for $300 and up. I’m not<br>going to do that to you. My conscience won’t allow it.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Why do my students believe I should charge $500? </p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Because you get 10 hours of video lessons. You watch over my<br>shoulder as I draw and teach you as if you were right there with me. You are<br>getting 10 hours of personal teaching.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at all the<br>lessons.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In the fast-paced<br>world of professional concept art, you must learn to draw quickly.
