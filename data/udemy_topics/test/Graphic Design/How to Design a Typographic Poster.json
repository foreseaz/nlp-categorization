    "description": "<p>  \t  A typographic poster is simply a poster that&#039;s based around a strong influence of type, whether they be individual letters or whole sentences. In this course, you will learn how to create a poster design that&#039;s based around type.  </p>  <p>  \t  As a bonus, you will also learn how to use Adobe Photoshop to take your completed typographic poster design, and showcase it a realistic environment. This is particularly useful for those who wish to showcase their designs on a portfolio, or even to clients.  </p>  <p>  \t  This course is for anyone who wants to expand their designer skill-set to include the specific niche of typographic poster design. Not only will you gain a solid understanding of designing type-based posters, but you will also learn other invaluable techniques and terminology that can be applied to other areas of design.  </p>  <p>  \t  This is a very hands-on, <strong style=\"\">learn by example</strong> approach to learning typographic design. In other words, we&#039;re going to focus on a single project from start to finish. While this course is relatively short, you should expect to gain a good understanding of how to design a typographic poster.  </p>",
