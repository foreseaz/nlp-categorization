    "description": "<p>Great video can help you grow your business, create a personal relationship with your customers, and make you more credible as an online instructor.</p>\n\n<p>When I talk to people about creating videos, the first reaction is usually sheer panic. And I get it, I used to be there too!\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Professional looking videos don’t need to be complicated… and Camtasia is an awesome tool for working with video. But owning the software alone isn’t enough – you have to know how to use it well to get great results… and that’s really why this course exists.  I have designed this course to take you from the basics to the mastery of Camtasia.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have built this course around showing you practical examples so can follow along and use them as reference to build your own projects, because that’s really what it’s all about.\n\n  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on where you are at with your knowledge level, the course will take you across the start line if you haven’t gotten there yet, of it will take you to the next level if you have already worked with Camtasia.</p><p>You don't need to be a tech wiz to create great videos - this course will teach you the right techniques in plain language and tricks you can put into action right away.</p>",
