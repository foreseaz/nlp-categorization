It teaches you how to &#039;deploy&#039; a short explainer video and sell more of your high-ticket services online.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                It&#039;s packed with secrets and tactics, taken from the advertising industry, and practical lessons. I also show how I <em style=\"\">personally</em> sell my high-ticket video production service.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">I had to learn it the hard way—YOU don&#039;t have to.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Really. You would need the equivalent of a full university semester-long course and at least 3 months of industry experience to learn these lessons by yourself.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t        Screw that, right?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                That&#039;s why the course is fast. It takes you from the start to finish of a proven marketing system—In 4 sections. Roughly 2,5 hours fast-paced video content.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                It&#039;s simple to copy for your own business. It&#039;s <strong style=\"\">visual</strong>, and makes use of examples.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                You will have a clear strategy to put on the table. Bulletproof. With safety measures...  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                I&#039;ve spent the <em style=\"\">last 3 years</em> producing and testing ad-videos for websites. I&#039;ve brought my clients unexpected great success and sometimes just a high quality video that helps understand.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Not all videos had impact. <strong style=\"\">But in all cases I&#039;ve learned a lot.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                I have worked with high-tech startups, to (dutch) universities and big companies like WeTransfer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Most companies hide their secrets. I like teaching. I like helping others improve their marketing. To help them make the next <strong style=\"\">big sale</strong>, or a lot of small ones.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                I&#039;ve consulted more than 200 companies, including those in online <em style=\"\">business masterminds</em>, like the Freedom Secret Society.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Get this course at the cost of 1 dinner for two at a <em style=\"\">cheap</em> restaurant... <br style=\"\">  \t                ...and get the information that can DOUBLE or even TRIPLE your revenue.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                You&#039;ll get these 2 bonus videos, previously <strong style=\"\">strictly</strong> <em style=\"\">exclusive</em> for a private business mastermind.  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">How I Do Meetings</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How I Do Proposals</li>  </ol>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Besides this, I&#039;m available for questions in the discussion sections. You would normally pay me €300,- for a single consultation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">This course -with lifetime access- is priced at 39 USD.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\"></strong>It&#039;s my first course, and I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s a steal.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Besides that,<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\"> Udemy </em>has a 100% Money-Back Guarantee for 30 days. </strong><br style=\"\">  \t                So this is what you should do:  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                Go to the top right of this page and click &quot;Take This Course&quot;. Make the payment (they have all the easy options), and <strong style=\"\">watch only 2 videos.</strong> If that didn&#039;t give you 1 new practical idea, send an email to support@udemy.com and just ask for a refund.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                No questions asked.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">WARNING:</strong> I will definitely not be available for questions forever. So if you want to make use of the opportunity to ask me anything in the discussions section, do it while I&#039;m still there.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">P.S. Remember this course should make YOU <em style=\"\">more money</em> through learning simple and proven marketing tactics.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">P.P.S. Really.
