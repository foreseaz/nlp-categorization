As a result, VMS designed this mini-course to introduce students to video marketing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tVMS has determined that page one rankings on the major search engines begins with keyword research.  This is the cornerstone of the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tVMS teaches students:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">How to use keyword research</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Why you should create at least 100 videos</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">How to add royalty-free music to your videos</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Why meta-data will help you achieve ranking success</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">How Google and YouTube influence ranking success</span></li>  \t<li style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Why you will never get your videos ranked on page one if you don’t do 3 things</span></li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe keyword research alone would help any entrepreneur or business owner do extremely well on social media marketing too.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe Video Marketing Scholar course is primarily video driven.  Many of the things we demonstrate on the videos are applicable to what every student needs to do to be successful with video marketing.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThere are 6 videos in this VMS mini-course.  Each video addresses a specific issue we have gotten from our students over the past 3 years. There is approximately 1 hour of video content available to students.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tVideo marketing should be a key component of any business owner’s arsenal.  VMS has gone to great lengths to fill in the knowledge gaps about video marketing and spent three full years refining the topics covered based on the dialogue we have had with customers all over the world.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe value you will receive with VMS is incalculable.  </p>",
