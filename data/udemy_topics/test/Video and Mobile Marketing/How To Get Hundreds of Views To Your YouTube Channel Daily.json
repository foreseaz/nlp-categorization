The key to more engagement, of course, comes from your viewers sharing your videos, not just you hammering them, and she reveals some effective ways to get that sharing going. If you expect a magic pill or strategy to make your videos more popular, you won&#039;t find it here for one really good reason: It doesn&#039;t exist. Hard work, quality videos and trying lots of different things until you hit your mark, only work if you know when you hit a home run, and that means, &gt;sigh&lt; stats and analytics which she goes into in ways that didn&#039;t make my eyes roll (which they usually do when people talk hits and minutes viewed, etc.) Ms Ileane makes a great point that if you have 30 videos and one is super popular an dyou don&#039;t know which one it is, then you won&#039;t make more videos related to that popular topic and miss out on tons of traffic as a result. So she shows you how to identify those golden videos. Her voice has a hypnotic quality and it feels like I am listening to a close family member. I learned a lot and I enjoyed the process. Highly recommended!</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Mark Timberlake&#039;s Review</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Some Excellent Tips And Insider Information</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Ileane shares some excellent tips on how to get your videos out there and how to share them socially, so if you want to deepen your audience for your YouTube content, then this has some great ideas and techniques for you to explore. :-)</em></strong>  </p>  <p>  \t        The focus of this course is on using social media to make a stronger connection and reach a wider audience with your YouTube Videos.
