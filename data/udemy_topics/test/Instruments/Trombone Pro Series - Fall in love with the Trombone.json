Having a snippet played by the first chair before playing as a group helped. Having something were you can easily go back and listen to a few tips at home is definitely a plus. So far I like the system!\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Student, Mount Dora High School</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"Very nice! I like the focus on tone quality. I like how the lessons build up in difficulty and how by the last few exercises I actually have to stop and go through some rhythms a few times to perfect them. The conductor is great, he gets across a lot of helpful information while also being enjoyable to listen to.\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Student, Colonial High School</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"When my students tested Pro Series, they had extremely favorable reactions as to how much they learned, how much they were assisted in acquiring that knowledge, and how much their existing skills were supported. Pro Series is an excellent reinforcement for all those musical aspects that we want our students to have—to study—when we are not with them.\"</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Cynthia Berry, Past President, Florida Bandmasters Association</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>MusicProfessor is pleased to now offer Pro Series Guided Practice lessons as part of video library. “Pro Series” is a revolutionary, self - directed practice system featuring an extraordinary set of instrument-specific, interactive video lessons and is designed for the more advanced and aspiring musician.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of Pro Series is a group of top educators and talented musicians just like you: dedicated to making the best music we know how, and we’re both proud and excited to share our hard work with you.
