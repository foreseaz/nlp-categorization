    "description": "<p style=\"\">This course is all about playing the classical guitar piece, &quot;Alman&quot; by the 16th century English composer Robert Johnson. By the end of this course, you will:</p><ul style=\"\"><li>learn how to use your right and left hand in the most relaxed way that best serves the music</li><li>understand what counterpoint is, and it effects your playing</li><li>have a solid understanding of musical concepts like meter and phrasing</li><li>be able to explain to someone what &quot;Alman&quot; even means</li></ul><p style=\"\">This is an intermediate course, so you should be able to play a simple, one-page piece and be able to more or less learn the notes to a piece from the sheet music (either standard music notes or guitar tab) on your own. If you&#039;re a beginner, this probably isn&#039;t the best piece for you. </p><p style=\"\">Do you wonder how a concert guitarist thinks about a piece of music that he or she is preparing to perform? Were you ever curious about why one book has one fingering for a piece of music while another book has a completely different fingering for the same piece of music?</p><p style=\"\">If so, you&#039;ll find the answers in this course. What&#039;s unique about this course is that in contrast to a lot of other online courses, this course reveals the process that guitar teachers and students go through in music conservatories and guitar festivals when they learn, teach, and perform a piece of music.</p><p style=\"\">By the end of the piece you&#039;ll be able to play a piece of music all the way through to a high standard, but in addition you&#039;ll have tools that you can use in your guitar playing to take all of your pieces to the next level. </p>",
