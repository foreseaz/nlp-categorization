At that time, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; was the best-selling piano solo record of all time and the only one ever to top the Billboard charts. The following year, one week after his 87th birthday, he died after a long bout with pancreatic cancer.  </p>  <p>  \t       This is the most famous piano arrangement of &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot; Roger Williams, nicknamed &quot;Mr. Piano&quot; by his international fans, created this piano riff that had made him famous worldwide.
