    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t         What is the course about? PAINLESS PIANO is my gift to you, after 30 years of teaching and 45 years of playing the piano. If you want to learn how to read music, sightread new music, build your technique, understand rhythm, learn cool pieces and then go out and learn your own music, this course is for you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         But at the same time- learning piano is not a chore- it is a soaring, ravishing artistic and spiritual joy! My students feel that way- they don&#039;t usually want to leave the lesson or the concert, and neither do I. We love the journey we take together. I want to share that with you.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         I had physical learning challenges as a child and one teacher told me I could not learn. But I loved it too much- and with the help of my magical mentor, I learned how to overcome, solve, figure out, and surpass my challenges. I can help you solve your musical challenges and any that come along down the road. We can do this together- and ultimately, you will do it yourself!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         Materials incl?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         There are videos, PFD&#039;s of musical scores, sightreading, rhythm and technique samples, and glossary, and the most important document: How to Use This Course PDF which is kind of the Mother Ship, tying all the pieces together.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t And please, please, if there is something that is not clear, let me know! Message me and ask about that. I will either explain it until you are clear, and in some cases, if I am able, send you more material that helps make it clearer. Thank you- please please don&#039;t be unclear about something and think you have to remain unclear. That is not how this course is! It is: clear, easy, and about helping you make music.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         How long will the course take to complete?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         This depends on your own goal- you can take the shortcut method- and only learn the pieces- in that case, I would say each piece could take a minimum of 90 minutes to 2 hours, so for 9 pieces, that would be 14 to 18 hours. But to build the whole foundation, so you not only learn the pieces, but also develop an early intermediate technique, reading level and theory knowledge, it would be longer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         An estimate would be: about 20 hours. This time is an estimate and based on your spending not TOO much time on the Theory, Rhythm and Sightreading sheets, more on the technique, and the most on the Repertoire.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       I&#039;m assuming you do all the bracketed sections in the Repertoire an average of 10 to 12 times each, and then practice the whole piece an average of 10 or more times. For Technique I&#039;m assuming you will practice each sample once, and half the samples around 10 to 15 times.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       You may get it done faster. And it may take longer. It is important to be as efficient as possible, and not practice what you have already mastered. There is a lot to learn- and to love!!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         How is the course structured? The course is designed to be clear and easy to use! 5 Lessons, and with each Lesson the following lectures: Theory, Rhythm, Sightreading, Technique and Repertoire components for an all round foundation.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Each Theory, Rhythm, Sightreading, Technique and Repertoire lecture has a video and a PDF to go along with video.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Each Lesson has 2 pieces (except Lesson 2, 1 great piece by Verdi!).  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t BTW- please consider doing me a huge favor that will only take a couple of minutes- please kindly review my course after the first lesson or so- the reason is, sometimes because we are busy we don&#039;t finish courses, so if you find what you&#039;ve done so far positive, consider giving me a positive review. You can change it later when you&#039;re finished and if you change your mind. But that will help me! Thank you!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Over 3 hours of instructional videos and PDF&#039;s designed to go along with what we are doing in the videos.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Easy, clear and if you have any questions let us know.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t         Why take the course? If you want to learn to play the piano, let your music sing to the world, but are also very busy with your own life, this is the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you want a teacher who LOVES his topic and wants to share that LOVE with you, this is the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you want a teacher who has BEEN THERE, and likely has had more of a challenge than you will, and knows how to solve it for you and teach you to solve challenges yourself, this is the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you want to learn 9 really cool pieces, be informed of any future courses and repertoire releases, be invited to master class, recitals, be part of a fun and interacive community, play for us online, make comments and help other students online, and help build our special Student Teaching component (depending on interest level) and be in touch with the teacher with ANY question, this is the course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Thank you!  </p>",
