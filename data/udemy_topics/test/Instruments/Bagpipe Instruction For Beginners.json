I will be covering how to buy a chanter, care of it, hand positioning, the scale, and learning Scots Wa Hae, the first tune everyone learns. Sheet music for all exercises is included for download. </p><p>With consistent practice, you should be able to play the tune comfortably within a month. Since you can revisit these lessons as much as you want, it is easy to zero in on the segments you need to move forward.  </p><p>You can have a lot of fun learning the pipes, and this course will make it possible with easy to follow, step by step instruction.</p>",
