Because the very fact that you’re reading this course description says a a lot about you…</p><p>You’ve always wanted to play guitar and so you bought one or received one as a gift. You picked up a couple of beginner’s courses or had a friend give you a few tips. You put in the time to learn a few chords and a strum or two. But you still can't play your favorite songs or jam with your buds. You’re frustrated because you’re still a beginner, and not yet a player.</p><p>Statistically, only 7% of the people who set out to learn guitar have the conviction to get as far as you have (the vast majority quit before they even learn three chords). So, congrats to you! Now, the only thing keeping you from graduating from beginner to guitar player is desire (we know you have that!) and the right course of study. </p><p>Rich Maloof’s GUITAR 201 is the bridge between beginner and guitar player. The curriculum is specifically designed to teach beginners how to play entire songs smoothly, add personality to their sound, and play with other musicians confidently. </p>",
