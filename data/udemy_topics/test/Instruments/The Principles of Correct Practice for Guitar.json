    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Traditional guitar instruction methods are essentially the same. </strong>They teach you the notes on the first few frets, then they show you what your fingers need to do to play them. Or, they show you a few chords, and give you a song to play.  </p>  <p>  \t      Unfortunately, <strong style=\"\">the vast majority of students will be unable to do these things in any kind of comfortable way</strong>, they will struggle to make the movements, and no matter how much they practice, they will be unable to actually make music. As time goes on, their physical problems in playing will increase, and they will have a mountain of music they play badly.<strong style=\"\"> &quot;More practice&quot; will only make things worse,</strong> because beginners are never aware of the tension being built into the muscles through the power of muscle memory - more practice only makes locks in more tension. I have seen this hundreds of times in my 43 years of teaching guitar.  </p>  <p>  \t      This course is vastly different, and it&#039;s effectiveness has proven itself with students of every style, every level, and every age since it&#039;s publication in 1998. Our focus is where it needs to be, and must be, in the beginning: learning to train your fingers so they become professional grade guitar playing fingers, capable of making smooth movements. That is the only way you can become a guitar player who can make music.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The first fret is the hardest place to play. No beginner can do that without struggling and building harmful tension into the muscles.</strong> This tension will limit or prevent your development as a guitar player. We avoid that with a special set of exercises that begin up the neck, where the left hand should begin its training.  </p>  <p>  \t      When you are done this course, you will have the <strong style=\"\">strong foundation</strong> in both your hands you need to make <strong style=\"\">continuous progress</strong>, and be a happy guitar player! You will also know an <strong style=\"\">effective practice method</strong> you will use to learn all new music.  </p>  <p>  \t      If you are a <strong style=\"\">beginner</strong>, this is the course you need to start correctly, and continue learning without hitting the usual playing plateaus. If you are one of the many<strong style=\"\"> long time players</strong> who have been stuck for years, and can&#039;t get better, this course will break down the barriers to your progress.  </p>  <p>  \t      &quot;The Principles&quot; method is the most effective guitar learning method in existence, and it will work for you!  </p>",
