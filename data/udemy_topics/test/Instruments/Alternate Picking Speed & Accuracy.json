    "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how guitarists like John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, and Steve Morse achieve such speed and precision in their alternate picking?</p>\n\n<p>Well, we are going to break down the technical details of alternate picking to its smallest parts and use a step-by-step approach to build your alternate picking technique from the ground up so you can take your guitar playing to the next level.</p>\n\n<p>You will start with exercises that isolate the left hand and right hand. Then you will move on to topics such as:</p><ul><li>Single String Technique</li><li>Inside and Outside Picking</li><li>String Skipping</li><li>One Note Per String</li></ul><p>As you master each new technique, you are presented with fun-to-play etudes that you will learn and then play back over included, full band backing tracks. Backing tracks are provided at various tempos so you can progress at your own rate.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been looking for the answer to the alternate picking mastery, look no further.</p><p><br></p>",
