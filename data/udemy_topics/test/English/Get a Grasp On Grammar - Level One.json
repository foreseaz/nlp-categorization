    "description": "<p>\t The Get a Grasp on Grammar series will sharpen your ability to communicate well through the written word. This one skill can make the difference that opens the doors to your success. Whether you are a student trying to achieve great grades, a business person working towards advancement, an author preparing a manuscript, a homemaker running a home, or you are learning English as a second language, it is imperative to get your message across in a clear, concise, and enjoyable manner.</p>  <p>\t One of the most common reasons for mistakes and disagreements stems from misunderstanding or misinterpreting something that was read. Therefore, learning how to put your thoughts down on paper in a way that takes away the guesswork for the reader will not only help you achieve your goals, it will also make your environment and relationships more harmonious.</p>  <p>\t Get a Grasp on Grammar - Level One will provide you with the foundational understanding of basic grammar elements and exercises to practice the principles in your own writing. To help you, each lesson includes an in-depth study of one of the basic parts of speech and its proper function and placement in a sentence. In this level, we will be learning about the following elements:</p>  <ul>\t<p>\t\t ·complete/simple subjects and predicates \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·determiners \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·nouns \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·pronouns \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·verbs, linking and helping verbs \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·adjectives \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·adverbs \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·conjunctions \t</p>\t<p>\t\t ·interjections \t</p>  </ul>  <p>\t Each lesson has a short video presentation of the concept. Then the real fun begins with the various writing exercises. There is a comment section in the course for you to leave questions and have discussions throughout the course. I will also be adding more exercises periodically to give you great practice and reinforce what you learn.</p>  <p>\t My goal is to help you become a better writer, so if you have a question that was not covered in a lecture and would be best answered visually, I will even add additional lectures to enhance your learning.</p>  <p>\t This course will lay the groundwork for more advanced elements of English grammar that will be addressed in levels two and three. As you progress, you will also learn key self-editing techniques to apply to your work. This will help enhance your business performance, improve grades, save time, and even save you money should you ever need to hire an editor.</p>",
