The course is fast moving, colourful and deliberately designed to encourage you to appreciate how to become an effective creative writer. I’ve used lots pictures - after all they paint a 1000 words - we just need to get those words out on paper!</p><p>You might be someone who enjoys the challenge of creative writing … perhaps you’d like to start a blog, contribute to a newsletter, write a book or … just write because you want to. Whatever your motivation, this course is an ideal opportunity to get some of the fundamental principles of creative writing - each lecture is complete, there’s plenty of practice and I’ll always feedback if you post a discussion.</p><p>There are many benefits to being a creative writer. A precise message is an excellent asset, particularly when there is so many internet, work and family distractions for the reader. Although it could be argued that communication has evolved and that using 'creative writing’ is no longer required in our fast moving 24 x 7, instant access lifestyles. </p><p>But I’d argue the complete opposite. Reading a well written creative writing piece can be an excellent escape and allow your mind to wander to a whole new world. From ‘The Hobbit’ to ‘Black Beauty,’ creative writers have opened doors and allowed us to be involved in soaring adventures.</p><p><strong>Contents and overview</strong></p><p>This course contains over 18 lectures and one hour of content. </p><p>However, much more than that, it’s a community of like minded individuals. As we develop and encourage each other you’ll get invaluable, and specific, feedback from your fellow students.  </p><p>By the end of this course you’ll have valuable skills that will help you quickly focus on the main components of creative writing. You’ll hear what others think of your work and I’ll always try to respond - perhaps a comment, maybe a new lecture.</p><p><strong>What are the requirements?</strong></p><p>An open mind, willingness to learn, plenty of practice!</p><p><strong>What am I going to get from this course?</strong></p><ul><li>Over 18 lectures and an hour of content</li><li>… but that’s evolving</li><li>You’ll enjoy a boost in creativity </li><li>You’ll know where to start</li><li>You’ll think about writing in a new way</li><li>You’ll be an important part of a like minded community</li></ul><p><strong>Who are the target audience?</strong></p><ul><li>Bloggers, article writers, school students, aspiring authors and hobbyists!</li></ul><p><br><br></p>",
