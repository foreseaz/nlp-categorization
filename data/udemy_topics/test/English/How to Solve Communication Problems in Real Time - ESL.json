    "description": "<p>When my English students travel abroad, the first thing they tell me is, “natives speak really fast.” Next they ask me if we can make some classes to help them understand natives that speak fast. <strong>Solution</strong><strong> 1</strong> is in this course because this is the exact class I give them.</p>  <p><strong>Solution 2</strong> is included in this course because forgetting or not knowing vocabulary in our second language always happens, and now you know how to solve this issue.</p>  <p>Natives use phrasal verbs and idioms all the time. You can memorize hundreds and hundreds of phrasal verbs and idioms, or use <strong>Solution</strong><strong> 3</strong> to learn them in real time.</p>  <p><strong>Solution 4</strong> is the answer to most peoples’ problems with numbers.</p>  <p>And I’ve included <strong>Solution</strong><strong> 5</strong> to make sure you get your hotel reservations, emails, and order numbers done correctly the first time.</p>  <p>If you are an upper-intermediate or advanced English speaker, these <strong>5 Solutions</strong> will guarantee that you are successful in your conversations with natives abroad, or other day to day interactions by telephone, video conferences, and in person.</p>  <p>These <strong>5 Solutions</strong> have helped my English students many many times. (And they have saved me tons of times too in my second and third languages - Spanish and Portuguese.) That’s why I developed this dynamic course.</p>  <p>Plus, there are 2 bonus lessons so you can sound like a native when you meet new people and go shopping.</p>  <p>Click the “take this course” button now, and let these <strong>5 Solutions</strong> help you communicate with native English speakers stress free.</p>",
