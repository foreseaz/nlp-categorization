    "description": "<p>Learn the American Accent and reach your personal and professional goals! Imagine yourself with the job you’ve always wanted, a promotion, traveling, speaking with confidence and attracting people. It could happen sooner than you think!</p><p>I truly believe that if you found this American English Accent training course, you understand a profound truth: That your education, skills, and talents no matter how impressive, can be limited by the way you speak English. Whether it’s a promotion at work, being more confident, getting that dream job, travel, or developing relationships and making new friends, it's even more attainable when your level of English and accent is similar to those we work with, and those we want to befriend.</p><p>This course will be much different than simply watching a movie or television show, as I’m sure you’re already doing. It’s not passive, but active learning of the principles of the American Accent. With each line from the movie, I will take you by the hand, and point out the principles of accent and pronunciation behind it. Why did the actor say it that way he did? We will unlock the secrets together, letter by letter, line by line.<br></p><p>When I was learning Tagalog (Filipino) and Spanish, having a native of those languages explain some things to me saved me tons of time, and embarrassment. Since I learned it in context, in its natural setting, it became an experience, which makes a strong impression on the memory. That propelled my language learning advancement. Those experiences are the secret to getting the Accent down correctly. With this American Accent course, you will get all those experiences and focused lessons on a regular on demand basis through nearly 50 different lectures!</p><p>The course, though engaging and fun, is for those willing to work hard daily, make progress, to obtain the American Accent. My course is especially designed for English speakers (intermediate to advanced) who wish to take their English to the next level, and obtain all the personal and professional rewards that come with speaking like a native. </p>",
