    "description": "<p>If you can't think in English, you can't become totally fluent in English. That may sound a little bit strange, but it's true. Translating your language into English will keep you from being able to naturally communicate. This course will push you to use your English brain. It includes exercises, techniques, and a rigorous path toward fluency. This course is absolutely essential for anyone ready to take their English to the next level. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You will be able to see my face and mouth clearly in each video lesson, and I will use a blackboard at all times. </p><p>Each lesson focuses on a single idea, and each is comprehensive. Students can go at their own pace and should take their time, with lots of practice between videos. Replaying each lesson is highly recommended. </p>",
