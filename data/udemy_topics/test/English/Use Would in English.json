    "description": "<p>One of the difficulties of English learners is to understand would clearly.</p>  <p>Understanding Would is a challenge and be able to use it in a sentence is another challenge, isn’t it?</p>  <p>No matter how many times I attempted to understand would either by looking up the dictionaries or the grammar books, none of them made any difference and I ended up not to understand it. </p>  <p>Curious thing is that I came across would quite often and it was literally driving me crazy because I wasn’t able to discover the hidden secret behind it.</p>  <p>So, finally I managed to uncover the meaning of would and I made this course to make it easier for other people who is willing to understand it.</p>  <p>If you have a difficulty in understanding would, like I had in the past, and want to know about it and get rid of it by pushing it out of the way,</p>  <p>I hope this course will help you to do that.</p>",
