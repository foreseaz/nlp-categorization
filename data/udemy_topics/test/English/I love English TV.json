    "description": "<p>  \t The &quot;I love English TV&quot; strategy is a revolution in adult language education.  You will watch real life TV scenes at natural speed without feeling lost.  Video lessons will stimulate your visual memory and provide context for common expressions.  Quizzes provide instant motivation and feedback wherever you are.  This is finally a practical course for working adults, but you must follow the directions carefully.  </p>  <p>  \t   This course takes you through short study cycles that can be completed anywhere: at home, on a bus, in a park.  Cycles take 15-20 minutes to complete.  Each cycle consists of a short videoclip: 2-8 minutes, a quiz and a series of phrases related to the videoclip.  There are currently 10 cycles and they can be completed in 10 days or less.  </p>  <p>  \t   A good student will watch the video, repeating the important section as many times as necessary, take the quiz and practice translating the phrases into his/her language.  For the best results, meet with a friend once a week and practice translating the most interesting phrases from your language back into English.  Studying with a friend will provide motivation and improve confidence and fluency even if your friend doesn&#039;t speak English very well - just be sure you both watch the video clips.  </p>  <p>  \t   So again, to get the most out of the course:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Watch a video clip.</li>  \t<li>Take a quiz.</li>  \t<li>Translate expressions into your language.</li>  \t<li>Practice translating back into English with a friend or teacher.</li>  \t<li>Watch another clip...</li>  </ul>",
