As humans, our brains tend toward a negativity bias. You might notice that the tiniest bad thing can ruin your entire day, even if everything else about that day has been wonderful. That's because our brains are a very old design, wired for survival - so we focus on the bad, quickly forgetting the good! </p><p>Thanks to exciting research, we now know that we have the ability to rewire our brains. We used to think that the way we were was fixed and unchanging, and that we were stuck with the brains we have once we reached adulthood. But we now know that our brains change as a result of experience, right up until the day we die. </p><p><strong>Your Week of Experiments!</strong></p><p>7 days to Happiness is a week long experiment where you get to try one power-packed stress buster and mood booster each day and by the end of the week not only will you feel better and be on your way to rewiring your brain for happiness for the rest of your life - you will also have a tool kit of 7 short and sweet easy things that you can do anywhere, anytime you want to!
