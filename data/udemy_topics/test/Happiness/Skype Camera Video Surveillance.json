You will learn how to determine what configurations are best based on the individual scenario.  Finally, you will learn how you can monitor multiple hosts at the same time.  My current use of Skype evolved out of my necessity to monitor my Mom after my Dad passed away.  I was over an hour away from her and was working long hours and needed a way to keep my peace of mind.  I imagine that if you are reading  this you are feeling that same need.  I have provided not only video-based information here but step-by-step documents to help you fulfill that need.  If you have any questions you can ask them via the discussion areas within the specific lectures.  I would love to hear your feedback, and will ensure that I quickly incorporate any changes needed to make you more successful.  Let's get started!</p><p>I hope you enjoy taking this course.  I hope you find that there is some unique information there on how to use Skype to monitor your home and family, and perhaps give you some peace of mind and address pain points you have worrying about your loved ones and your pets.  I also want to emphasize courtesy and respect here with regard to utilizing this tool, making sure people know that they're being monitored and respecting their privacy as well.  I've always been up front with my mom - hey I'm going to be popping into your living room page by yourself and I will make sure what is going on here, e.g., of a lot of problems with the as everybody does with solicitors calling the house and I would see that she's getting on the phone answering and then I would call out to her - hey don't do that hang up the phone - so it averted a lot of crises having that instantaneous contact with her and give me a lot of peace of mind.  While I was working I would have her off on the side there and I could see you have anything was going on in the house.  So go out and enjoy!  Always be respectful and be careful again that the crucial setting of allowing only contacts to call into your home on your host and if there's anything I can do to improve the course please let me know.  Please put comments in the specific discussions related to what your question is about or your recommendation for improvement and I will do my very best to make this course as useful as possible to you - and thank you again!<span><br></span></p>",
