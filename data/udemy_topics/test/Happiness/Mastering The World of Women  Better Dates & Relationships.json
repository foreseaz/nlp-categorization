You will learn that by changing yourself and taking proactive action you will transform into a man that is every lady's dream. based on your self-assurance, confidence, understanding of your authority and your power as a man. </p><p>What students say about this course:</p><p>\"This course has helped me so much to understand women. After I applied what I learned to real life OI never felt out of place anymore in front of a woman.\" – Stallon Silver</p><p>\"Amazing Course. I love the fact that has so much practical advice. Before taking this course I wasn't confident at all about girls, but now I can approach any woman without feeling the fear of being rejected. \" – Alex Feliciano</p><p>\"I recommend this course to any man that want to improve his skills with the ladies. This course made me challenge my own identity and why I had believed that I was just simply “bad with ladies\" and made me take action into talking to any girl and feel at ease with myself\" - Hans Graubard</p><p>'As weird as it sounds I bought this course for my brother. I grew up with him and I love him dearly, and he is a very smart professional engineer but he's never been good with girls, In fact, he's 26 and he's had only one girlfriend on his life just for six months. I could see the struggle on him and after he started applying on his life what he learnt on this course, he finally found a girlfriend and he is a completely different person\" - Lisa Cartwright</p>",
