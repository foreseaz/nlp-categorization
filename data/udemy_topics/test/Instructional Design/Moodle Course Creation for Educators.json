I decided that I would write and record a couple tutorials for her that would cover the basics of the program. After I finished one tutorial I would think to myself, &quot;I just&nbsp;<em style=\"\">have</em>&nbsp;to include one more tutorial covering another facet of the software.&quot; Needless to say, about 50 tutorials later I felt I had something that would really lay the foundation that she needed.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">WHAT IS MOODLE?</strong></p><p style=\"\">Just in case you are wondering what Moodle is exactly... Moodle is this free, open-source, learning management system wherein educators can create online learning environments for their students. It is what high schools and colleges use to offer online classes. Educators use the program to distribute notes and resources, implement quizzes, set up forums and chats, and build an online community around their subject matter.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">I love that Moodle allows my students to acces my subject matter and participate in my classes from anywhere in the world... even when they are sick or on vacation! I love that&nbsp;Moodle does the majority of the grading for me... which means I can hang out with my wife more! I love that&nbsp;Moodle allows me to integrate media into my curriculum with ease; this keeps my students engaged. And I love that Moodle helps prepare my students for the acadmic environments they will undoubtedly encounter after graduation.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">WHY FOUNDATIONS IN MOODLE?</strong></p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Course Creation</em>&nbsp;walks you step-by-step through the <strong style=\"\">activity</strong> and <strong style=\"\">resource</strong> functions of the Moodle learning management software. This course includes 48 video lectures that detail each step in the process. This course is meant for those who already have access to a Moodle Installation whether personal or through a school or district.</p><p style=\"\">It is meant for those who are in the early stages of using the software.</p><p style=\"\">So many educators want to incorporate technology into their instruction but don&#039;t exactly know where to start.</p><p style=\"\">If you are looking for a place to start...</p><p style=\"\">...this course is for you!&nbsp;</p>&lt;/p&gt;",
