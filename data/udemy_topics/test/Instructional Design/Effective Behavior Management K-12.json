    "description": "<p>This course will cover 5 main areas that over the years that I have been teaching have been proven to be highly effective in managing students both for behavior, academic achievement, and classroom organization. When you finish this course you will have a firm understanding of how to implement classroom management strategies. Classroom management in my opinion is one of the most important aspects of being a teacher. You will also leave this course with some great websites to help with your classroom management and also a bunch of goodies that I have used over the years from trial and error and also from other teachers that have helped me along my teaching career. The course is not designed to take weeks and weeks to complete rather it's straight to the point useful information that you can take to your classroom the next day to use. The course is structured as a self paced course.</p>",
