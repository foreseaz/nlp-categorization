We will use highlights from a recently developed STEAM unit on spirals in nature which was created as a partnership between an arts organization, a parent-led gardening program and a school hungry for collaboration.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe course will take less than 30 minutes to complete and at the end you will have new confidence and skills to take back to your school as well as a sample curriculum outline to get you started.  </p>",
