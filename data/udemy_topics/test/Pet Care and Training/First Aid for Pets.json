It includes a series of explanatory videos, demonstrations with the one and only Delilah the Pitbull, and printable instructions for assembling your own pet-friendly first aid kit at home. We&#039;ve thrown in a few quizzes to help with learning, too! Dr Katherine will conduct live sessions to take questions and respond to comments about the material. Please note that this is not intended to replace veterinary advice and you should always seek veterinary attention in case of emergency.  </p>",
