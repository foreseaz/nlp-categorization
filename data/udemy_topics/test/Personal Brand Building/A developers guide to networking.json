You never know when you might meet your next client, friend and/or just get a chance to practice telling people what you are about.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to say that over the course of 2015 alone I more than doubled my network which now stands at just over 2500 people. I've been to dozens of conferences, having overcome my fear of public speaking.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I used to be very shy and unsure of myself, so going to events with rooms full of strangers was completely out of the question. I am so glad those days are behind me and in 2015 I discovered the hidden power of MeetUp and how you too can leverage this app to grow your network.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Please join me for the essentials needed to grow your network and personal brand.</p>",
