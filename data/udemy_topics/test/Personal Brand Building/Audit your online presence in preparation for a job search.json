    "description": "<p>This course is for anyone seeking to polish his or her online presence in preparation for a job search. 77% of HR representatives perform an online audit of prospective employees, and over half have eliminated candidates based on information they found. Harmful information included drinking or drug habits, bad-mouthing a previous boss, company, or fellow employees, provocative or inappropriate photographs and information, lying about their qualifications, poor communications skills, criminal behavior, and discriminatory comments related to race, gender, religion, etc.</p><p>Twenty percent of employers said that a candidates online presence was instrumental in landing them the job they were seeking. Helpful information included: background information that supported their professional qualifications; evidence that the candidate was well-rounded and showed a wide range of interests; great communication skills; a personal website that conveyed a professional image, and that the candidates personality was clearly a good fit within the company culture.</p><p>This course does not take very long, and it will help you build your profile into something you can be proud to show prospective employers.</p>",
