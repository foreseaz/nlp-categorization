    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t  This course will give you exercise in pronunciation and deepen your knowledge from courses A1.1 and A1.2. It was originally created as an phonetic audio course for beginners. It has  proven to be very helpful to improve the speaking and reading competence. Especially it is a good starting point to begin with reading on your own.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  If you are a basic learner I suggest you to watch videos because it will give you some exercise in reading, recognition of syllables and some feeling where to put emphasis within words.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  In case you are an advanced learner you can download audio files and listen the tracks few times, don&#039;t forget to repeat after me while listening.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  And dont forget to give me tips how to improve my work.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Thank you all  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t  Leo  </p>",
