    "description": "<p>In 2009, I received admission from 4 USA law schools out of 6 law schools I applied. I selected one and came to USA from China. You must be shocked to found out I was labeled as \"English Idiot\" back in senior high school in Shanghai, China. The school system is an old system, and not efficient to help you master a foreign language. The school system couldn't afford to keep some very good teachers, because they are not getting paid too much. And the school system often label some smartest children as \"stupid\". If you want to become the top expert of anything, the best way probably is to teach yourself. I created this course to help people who wants to become a top expert in Mandarin, who wants to speak, communicate and function like Native Chinese speakers (even if you are an absolute beginner), everyone is different, I want to teach my course by collecting feed backs and questions and design it to fit students' need.</p><p><strong>Course released on 9/13/15 with 9 lectures</strong></p><p><strong>Course Update: Added 3 Lectures 1 Quiz on 9/16/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 2 Lectures and 1 Downloadable PDF 9/18/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 2 Lectures and 1 Downloadable PDF 9/19/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 1 Lecture 9/22/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 1 Lecture 10/1/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 3 Lectures 10/13/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 3 Lectures 10/15/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 1 Lecture 10/16/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 2 Lectures 10/18/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 3 Lectures 1 Downloadable PDF 11/23/15</strong></p><p><strong>Added 1 Lectures 2/27/2016</strong></p>",
