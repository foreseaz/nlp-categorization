    "description": "<p>College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own Intermediate Level 2 is a sequel to my two previously published, unanimously five-star rated courses: College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own Beginning Level and Intermediate Level 1. This course is the second half of Intermediate level Chinese, and allows you to learn in just one month a full semester's college Chinese curriculum at intermediate level based on the same range of vocabulary, grammar, situational dialogues and discussion topics and save you 6000 dollars of college tuition, with the same proficiency achieved. It has 48 lectures, around 7 hours. As the other two courses, its design simulates to a great extent  the teacher-student interaction in the classroom, such as found in oral exercises of answering questions, reading after the teacher, describing pictures, translation and grammar drill, etc. By using hundreds of entertaining pictures that immediately tests your application of learned language information after every slide, this course brings teaching, reviewing, testing and application of language into a quick succession simulating the cognitive mode of immersive learning of language. Therefore, it combines the benefits of classroom teaching, Rosetta Stone Chinese and online learning while avoiding their shortcomings. Consequently, in this course, you are not only listening to my lectures, but fully participating in practicing the learned language, with my correction provided.As the third sequel of this language learning sequence (altogether five courses), it allows you to progress from basic, daily situational dialogue to discursive language of discussion and debate on daily and social topics: such as discussion of the habitability of a city or a building; Chinese schools of cuisines; criteria  for purchasing goods; conflict resolving in dating relationship; the benefits and harm of Computer Age. Through this course, you will learn not only vocabulary for daily conversation, but also more sophisticated vocabulary and grammar for discussing increasing advanced social topics. The instructor is again Professor Hong Zeng, an awarding-winning professor of Chinese for 16 years at prestigious American liberal arts colleges and national universities. After this course, you will be fully ready to embark on studying advanced Chinese in this language sequence. </p>\n\n<p>If you find this course helpful, please check out my other courses in this sequence: College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own Beginning Level and Intermediate level 1, as well as my \"Business Chinese Course\", the only course on Udemy in business Chinese language.  <br></p>\n\n<p><br> </p>",
