    "description": "<p>This is the first and only course on Udemy teaching business Chinese language. Since China has risen to be the biggest economic body in the world, learning business Chinese will greatly boost your business with China, the biggest supplier in the world market.Through this course, you can learn the fundamental aspects and essential usage of Mandarin Chinese used in conducting business. It has five sections and around 40 lectures, altogether 8 hours. The sections are as following: 1)introduction;  2) business reception, including welcoming your business guests, arranging business meal, taking taxi, registering for the hotel and changing foreign currency; 3) business negotiation, including negotiation of price, packaging, shipping, minimum order and signing the contract; 4) find business partners, including lectures on looking for supplier, joint business partner, sales agent,etc; 5) Amazon FBA business, including participating in Hong Kong trade exhibition, and contacting Chinese suppliers listed on Alibaba. For each topic on one specific business occasion, there are three lectures:  the first lecture teaches the vocabulary and grammar used on that business occasion, and provides sentence by sentence explanation for the business dialogue text. The second lecture  is your text practice of business  dialogue under my drilling (you read after me sentence by sentence and answer questions about the dialogue text), the third lecture is an acting/performing video of that dialogue to reinforce your learned and practiced business language. It takes you about one month to finish the whole course that would be extremely useful and comprehensive for teaching you the language to conduct business with China. The instructor is Professor Hong Zeng, an award-winning professor of Chinese for 16 years at prestigious American universities, such as UNC, Chapel Hill, College of William and Mary, Swarthmore and Carleton College, Hamline University. She has taught Chinese language at all levels, including courses in business Chinese. Numerous American students taught by her have found jobs in prestigious business companies using their learned Chinese skill. Through this course, you would be very confident to conduct business with China in authentic, elegant business Chinese.  Any students interested in learning Business Chinese can take this course, because its detailed explanation on vocabulary, grammar and text facilitates learning from the scratch. However, since business Chinese is understandably more formal and sophisticated in vocabulary than daily Chinese, it is strongly advised that students would take my other two courses, \"College Mandarin Chinese on Your Own\" beginning and intermediate level to learn the basic Chinese sound, writing and grammar system as necessary preparation for this course. </p>",
