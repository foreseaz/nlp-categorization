Maybe even hundreds.</p><p>But how many of those things did you make happen?</p><p>You probably only achieved a small portion of what you\nthought last year you'd get done by now.</p><p>You're\nnot the only one.</p><p>We all\nhave a ton of goals that we'd like to accomplish.  </p><p>We\ntell ourselves we don't have the time, energy or focus.</p><p>We tell\nourselves that someone or something outside of ourselves is keeping us from\ngrabbing onto what we really want....</p><p>But the\ntruth is that's not it!</p><p>If outside forces aren't conspiring against you to keep you from fulfilling your own dreams and if we can't blame a lack of time or energy, then what is it?</p><p>Is it laziness? Is it lack of ability? Nope. it isn't any of those things either.</p><p>It's a <strong>lack of motivation that keeps us from achieving our goals.</strong></p><p>You see we've been going about creating motivation the wrong way. We haven't been properly taught how to get motivated and stay motivated. It's not something you learn in school,  our instructors  don't focus on making sure we've mastered \"motivation.\"<br></p><p>In fact... the only \"motivation\" most of us are ever taught is the motivation to avoid punishment! We need to create motivation through reward structures. </p><p>But it doesn't matter how skilled you are... if you don't have the motivation, you're going to spend the rest of your life wishing that you could get your hands on what you want.</p><p>That's no way to live.</p><p>But here's the thing... <strong>if you don't have the right strategies and techniques... getting the motivation you need is impossible!</strong></p><p>Motivation is easier to find and maintain, then you may think. In this course, I will walk you through my process that will create the willpower and motivation to accomplish any goal you set your mind to. There are some key components that are correlated with motivation and willpower.<br></p><p>Motivation is the energy that gives behavior direction and focus. In this course you will learn about the scientifically proven methods to create motivation.</p>",
