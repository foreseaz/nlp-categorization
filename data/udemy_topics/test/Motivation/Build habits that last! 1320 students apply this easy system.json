I was one of the many people who <strong>failed to keep their commitments</strong>, especially the commitments to themselves.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Then I started learning about myself.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  I studied hundreds of books and I've done numerous mini projects to test my limits. From leaving a chocolate on my nightstand to publishing my jogging sessions on social media.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  I've studied techniques on the internet. Some of them work, some of them don't. Some might work for others but may or may not work for you.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Developing effective habits is a challenge in itself.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  This course is here to guide you into implementing effective, downâ€“to-earth strategies to achieve your goals.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  This is not a listing of hundreds of techniques.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In this course we talk about <strong>practical things</strong>, the things that work.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Things like:  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  - habit linking -&gt; an effective strategy to <strong>remember your habit</strong> at the exact moment you need to activate it  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  - the 3 elements of a habit -&gt; the only theory in the course (but we aren't stopping  here, after this lesson you'll be able to better <strong>understand your habitual actions and how to rewrite them</strong> according to your needs)  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  - the SBS technique and how you can use it to <strong>keep yourself motivated over long periods of time</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  All of the techniques come from <strong>personal experience</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In this course I'll tell you <strong>how I lost 22 pounds</strong>, <strong>how I exercise daily</strong> (and how you can too, in only 30 minutes) and you'll get useful bonuses, bonuses that will complement the content of the course.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>The Challenge!</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  After you've internalized the necessary strategies for breeding long-lasting habits and gone through the practical exercises, then you are ready for the secret challenge.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  In this challenge you'll have to implement a simple habit starting from the first day. At the end of your first month, if you've implemented the habit daily, <strong>you'll win a prize and a place in the Hall of Fame</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  Note that this is not a guide for eliminating bad habits (though some principles found here might be useful in doing just that).  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  This guide offers <strong>practical strategies to get your first successes</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  And after the first few steps, the others will come easily.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Join this course now</strong> and create your own habit in the first lesson.  </p>\n\n<p>  \t                  See you in the private section.  </p>",
