Most videos are between 3 and 6 minutes long and are therefore easy to digest and easy to again at a later time as a refresher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  The course is over 4 hours long and comprised of over 60 individual videos broken up into 15 Sections.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  The only requirement for taking this course is a Gmail account, which is free and incredibly easy to set up.  To complete the course you will also need to have Google Chrome downloaded, which is also free and very easy to set up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t  If you use these time saving productivity boosting tips to save <strong>30 minutes a day in wasted time you will end up saving over a month of 40 hour work weeks </strong>over the course of a year.<strong> </strong> To put that in perspective, you will only need to <strong>save less than 4 minutes per hour</strong> in a given 8 hour workday.
