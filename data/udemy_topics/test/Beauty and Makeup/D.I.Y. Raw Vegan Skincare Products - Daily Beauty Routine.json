Lip Balm, Lip Scrub, Face Wash, Cream and Moisturisers </strong>❤  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                    We are going to experience making natural skincare products with organic raw vegan ingredients which are food-grade, easy to find, local, fresh and very affordable. With this course you will feel inspired to incorporate more fresh fruits and veggies in your beauty routine and diets. <br style=\"\">  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                    It is fun, creative and your skin and body will love it!  D.I.Y. your own skincare products is not just a craft or a money-saving skill, but also a lifestyle that contributes to your health and beauty. I had serious eczema about 6 years ago and I tried to heal my skin by studying different natural therapies and making my own natural face cream and face cleansers. About 2 years ago, I became interested in raw veganism, and felt the urge to put raw vegan elements into my cosmetics.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Why &amp; What is raw?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                Fruits and vegetables are full of antioxidants, vitamins, bioavailable water and skin reviving acids which are more stable, more effective and sustainable for your skin than the concentrated and processed substances in commercial beauty products. Flowers like roses and lilies will also be used in our skincare products. You will be surprised how easy it is to make face cream and moisturisers out of them.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                                Raw cold pressed plant oil, grains and seeds are full of skin-loving fatty acids and minerals. You can make lip balm, face cleaner, scrubs and face cream with these beautiful ingredients, with <strong style=\"\">a shelf life of up to 6 months.</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">In the 27 lectures of the course you will learn how to make 8 products, divided into 4 sessions:  </strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Lip Care: Lip Balm and Lip Scrub</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Face Wash: Oriental Ayurvedic Face Wash Powder and Aloe Vera Juice Face Cleaner, gently cleaning your skin without striping off the skin&#039;s natural protective oils</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Face Cream: Face &amp; Body Cream and A Living Raw Skin Cream which fits different skin types, made of raw plant oils, strengthening and nourishing</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Moisturisers: Cucumber Toner and Flower Toner, hydrating, soothing and refreshing</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Course Materials</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">More than 50 minutes of video modules: the making process</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Written instructions and recipes </li>  \t<li style=\"\">Variations of recipes: give your unique touch to the products</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Why join me to D.I.Y. &#039;skin food&#039;?</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t                            Enjoy natural skincare products with transparency of ingredients. By making it yourself, you can make sure to use only natural ingredients that <strong style=\"\">improve your skin health </strong>rather than just performing instant results.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">‘Only put what you can eat on your skin’</strong> sounds like an old saying of your grandma, but it is true! Pineapples, bananas, strawberries, sesames, avocados, lemons, cucumber and many more, they are my &#039;skin food&#039;! Yum!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">I save a lot of money making my own raw beauty routine</strong>, instead of buying premium quality organic skincare products. I once found a raw face cream of 50g in an online shop for $35 and I felt so happy that I can make it myself for about $2!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Raw vegan skincare products do last long!</strong> Many raw ingredients like plant oils, seeds, grains and minerals have very stable antioxidants and antibacterial properties and have very low water content  for bacteria to grow.  Skincare products made with these ingredients can last for up to 6 months and possibly longer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">    You can make your very own skincare products which fits your skin type</strong> because you will learn how to make them and also the nature and characters of different ingredients.  You can be creative in designing your combinations and recipes!  </p>",
