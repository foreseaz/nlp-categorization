    "description": "<p>This course is the ultimate guide to create a hip-hop beat for the club. We start from scratch and move through every detail of every step needed to make a professionally sounding record. </p><p>We begin by going over recommended music gear to be used in the studio when producing modern music. We will cover both hardware and software and what to look for in each to adapt to your needs.</p><p>We move on to learning what qualities to look for in the sounds for each instrument, including the synth, bass, kick, clap, and hi-hat. This section is really important because knowing what types of sounds to use can either make or break you as a producer.</p><p>The next topic is song structure. We go over a brief history then lay out the top 5 most popular song structures used today. </p><p>We move on to building both the melodic foundation for the synth and bass as well as a detailed approach of how to build the rhythm section. We go bar by bar and explain how to use both melodic and rhythmic variation to keep your listeners interested and to create movement within the record.</p><p>We then end the course with some final touches and tips &amp; tricks of what to do after your record is created to get it played in the club.</p><p>This course is for the producer that has some experience but wants to understand the details of every step of the production process so that they have more creative control of both their productions and their career. </p><p>This course is around 2 hours. I recommend that after going through the first time, to go back through to strengthen your understanding of topics that you don't fully understand. Repetition is the key to learning.</p>",
