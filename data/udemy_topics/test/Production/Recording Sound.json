    "description": "<p>If you want to <strong><em>get the best sounding recordings </em></strong>the best place to start is by <strong><em>understanding the principles of sound</em></strong> as they relate to recording. By the end of this course, you will :</p>\n\n<ul><li>Understand the Main Characteristics of Sound Waves. </li></ul><ul><li>Be aware of the idiosyncrasies of human hearing that can cause recordings to not sound as good as they could. </li></ul><ul><li>Understand how and why sound behaves the way that it does. </li></ul><ul><li>Make better sounding recordings because you will know how to control sound within your recording environment.</li></ul>\n\n<p>This course is put together with <strong><em>your understanding in mind.</em></strong> There are added experiential stories to help explain concepts. Creative illustrations are effectively used to illuminate points so that through a combination of sight, and sound, you can <strong><em>easily grasp the nuances of each lecture</em></strong>. </p><p>There is a series of challenging quizzes that are designed to reinforce the most important concepts from each lecture as you go along. <strong><em>The goal is always to emphasize your understanding </em></strong>of each piece of the broader subject, and there are times when foundational concepts are re-visited in order to solidify your learning knowledge.<strong><em> Best of all you can go at your own pace!</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is designed for <strong><em>YOU</em></strong>, the home recording hobbyist. This is the course that will show <strong><em>YOU</em></strong> how to <strong><em>take your recording to a higher level</em></strong>. Whether you are a beginner who is just learning, or a more experienced individual who wants to know more about the theory of the sound, this is the course that will help you reach your goal of<em> </em><strong><em>getting the best sound possible. </em></strong>This course is also a great introduction for anyone who wants to <strong><em>get more serious about audio engineering</em></strong> in a broader sense. Completing this course is <strong><em>the most efficient way to gain inside knowledge</em></strong> that you might not ever learn on your own. <strong><em>They don’t teach this stuff in recording software manuals!</em></strong></p>",
