    "description": "<p><strong>What students are saying about this course:</strong></p><p><strong><em>A great introduction *****</em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong><em>This is a good intro to EDM for sure. Massive is explained well and the sound design aspect of the course in itself is pretty well thought out. Definitely worth the value, especially if you are new to this kind of music. I've been following it using FL Studio 12 instead of Logic, I've encountered no real issues. DAW doesn't matter, the techniques and information is still valid across any software.</em></p><p><em>I would recommend it for sure.</em></p><p><em>- Mason D</em></p><p><strong><em>good mix of theory + tool basics + practical advice *****</em></strong></p><p><em>As a relative newbie I found this really accessible, and even things that I was familiar with had good review components and examples. The course is heavily geared to Logic Pro (which works for me), so that may be a consideration if you are on a PC.</em></p><p><em>- Sam Marcus</em></p><p><strong><em>Very Detailed *****</em></strong></p><p><em>This is one of the best EDM courses I have taken. It is very clear from start to finish, and I was very satisfied with what I learned. Looking forward to more courses from Robbie!</em></p><p><em>- Douglas S.</em></p><p><strong><em>Nice and clear *****</em></strong></p><p><em>I really like that the tempo is not too fast and i can understand everything clearly.:)</em></p><p><em><strong></strong>- Andrea Paaro</em></p><p><strong><em>***2016 Version Updated*** This course is fully up to date with Logic Pro X, Massive, and Battery 4!</em></strong></p><ul><li><em>Are you a beginner at electronic music production?<br></em></li><li><em>Are you interested in making your own EDM music and sharing with your friends?<br></em></li><li><em>Do you have little experience with Logic Pro X but would love to learn more?<br></em></li><li><em>Do you want to go beyond the basics and create something that you could play at a venue?<br></em></li><li><em>Have you been to a music concert or festival and dreamed of being on that stage one day?<br></em></li></ul><p>If you have answered <strong>YES</strong> to all the previous questions, then this is the course for you!</p><p><br></p><p>This course is specifically designed for aspiring beginners and intermediate students. I will walk you through step-by-step, on how to produce the \"hip-shaking\" dance music you hear in the preview from start to finish.</p><p><em>Don’t worry</em>! This is not one of those super beginner courses that just teaches you how to save and open files in Logic Pro X. By the end of this course, you will have learned how to:</p><ul><li><em>Create strong and unique sounds from scratch using Massive VST</em></li><li><em>Mix your instrument tracks properly</em></li><li><em>Create energetic build-ups and transitions through various techniques</em></li><li><em>Understand the theories behind sound and mixing EDM music</em></li><li><em>Create a layout that you can use to produce more tracks in the future</em></li><li><em>Apply these concepts in creating your very own dance music!</em></li></ul><p>You will learn so much from this course. And even if you don’t feel that this course is for you, there’s always a <strong>30-day money back guarantee</strong>. So you have <strong>absolutely nothing to lose!</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>What if I want to learn EDM music on my own?</strong></p><p>Yes, there are tons of videos on Youtube that teaches you how to produce your own music with Logic Pro X, but it’s hard to see your progress with these videos. It’s like trying to learn the guitar with a new teacher every week. Half the time, you will be stuck learning the same thing over and over again. Save yourself the time, and learn from my years of experience. This course moves from lesson to lesson so that you are able to fully grasp how to produce electronic dance music the right way. Remember, your time is valuable! Don’t waste it sifting through hours of Youtube footage.</p>",
