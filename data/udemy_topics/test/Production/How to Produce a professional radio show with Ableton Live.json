Requested by one of the students, you can now see how to add effects to your tracks using the send and returns commands. (less cpu demanding than adding the same fx on every track!)</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>- Do you want to be the next Hardwell or Tiesto? Or / And make a name for yourself in the DJ market &amp; get more gigs?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            Then this course is for you. One of the fastest way to establish your name out there as a DJ is reaching a wide audience quickly. And radio is the perfect way for this. Follow everything I’ll teach you in this course and you’ll be able to produce a real radio show that radios won’t be able to resist broadcasting. Radios schedules are full of badly produced radio shows and they’re craving for better shows. I can tell you this since I’m a program director myself, working in radio for the last 15 years.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>-Discover the secrets that will make your radio show desirable for a program director.</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            Even A-List DJs make mistakes because they’re not aware of certain aspects of radio which lead them to produce bad radio shows. I’ll be delivering to you my 15 years expertise in the radio world so you can skip the mistakes and getting straight to offer a true professional-sounding radio show. I’ll point everything you need to know about what to do and what NOT to do! This course will cover everything from the content, to commercial breaks, where to put the jingles, how often, how long the tracks should last for, how to a clock for your show (one of the most important thing!)…and much more.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>-The best tool for the job</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            Ableton live isn’t only a great tool for producing music and performing live. It is THE fastest tool there is to produce your radio show as fast as possible. And you’ll see how in this course! Even if you don’t know how to use the software, you’ll be up and running in no time as I explain here everything you need to know to produce your radio show ( along with some other tips along the way! )  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>-Who is this course for?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t            This high level course is designed for producers and/or DJs who want to be heard on the radio. It’s also aimed at radio show producers/hosts, or radio production companies who might want to level up the quality of their work by tailoring exactly the program to the requirements of radio.  </p>  <p>  \t            The techniques can be applied to any genre of music.  </p>  <p>  \t            By the end of this course, you’ll have acquired all the required skills to deliver a very high quality product to radios. Don&#039;t get fooled by the apparent short length of the course and the videos. It&#039;s pretty intense, which is why you&#039;ll probably want to take notes, rewind, and watch again to make sure you haven&#039;t skipped anything as pretty much everything taught in this course if of importance!  </p>  <p>  \t    Best of all, I&#039;ll happily give you feedback on your projects, don&#039;t hesitate to send me link if you want me to give a listen to something and tell you personally where you should be improving !  </p>",
