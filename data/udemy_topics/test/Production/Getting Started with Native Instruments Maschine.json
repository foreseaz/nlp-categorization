When used together, the hardware gives you unparallelled control over the software. You can use Maschine whether you&#039;re a DJ or producer, in the studio or the club, with the software or as a MIDI controller.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t     This course is a great opportunity to learn how Maschine works even if you never tried producing music before as all of the video lectures were created with beginners in mind.  It starts with the very basics of the software and hardware and gradually moves on to more advanced techniques like macro controls and applying effects to external audio sources.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Please note that the course materials were created using the Maschine 1.8 and earlier software with a Maschine MK1 controller. Users of the Maschine 2.0 and later software will find that many aspects of the software are different. You can watch the free sample videos to see the some of the interface differences before purchasing this course.</em>\r\n</p>",
