    "description": "<p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Course Description</strong></p><p style=\"\">Learn about how important the knee meniscus is in protecting the knee from stresses and strains that might otherwise damage the joint surfaces and lead to irreparable arthritis. Understand those issues that face both you and the clinical team if you damage your meniscus, and become more confident in making the right decisions about treatment.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Putting anatomy into context</strong></p><p style=\"\">A sympathetic explanation of the anatomy of the menisci and the ligaments that help to support them, lead the student to a clearer understanding of the functional consequences of a meniscus tear or an avulsion. Highlighting the key differences between the medial and lateral meniscus will clarify for you why management decisions may differ in these two structures. The take-home message focuses on how apparently minor injury of a meniscus can lead to major consequences, unless managed appropriately and in a timely fashion.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Richly illustrated, clear explanations</strong></p><p style=\"\">Simple explanations, but never condescending, are supported by unique illustrations. Most of the 23 lectures (in 6 sections) integrate illustration into video via whiteboard animations. Medical publications and online references at an appropriate level offer extra value via the Resources sections of each Lecture.</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Who will benefit from this course?</strong></p><p style=\"\">The course is intended for people who have a meniscus problem of their own, and who want to understand the issues and to be able to discuss matters confidently with a doctor in order to allow them make sensible decisions. </p><p style=\"\">It will also benefit members of the medical profession who have a need to understand knee orthopaedics, such as nursing staff, physiotherapy students, and junior doctors.</p><p style=\"\">The course will probably take two hours for a beginner to complete, but the additional reference material in the Resources section will of course add extra value.</p>",
