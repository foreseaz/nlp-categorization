    "description": "<p>  \t    Foam Rolling  </p>  <p>  \t    Foam Rolling is a self-massage or  self-myofascial release techniques used to relieve tightness and tension  in the body with the use of your own body weight and a cylindrical foam  roller. During exercise, the muscle group breaks down muscle fibers in  order to adapt to the workout and grow stronger with continued use.  However, the frequent muscle fiber use and exercise will cause friction  among the muscles and develop knots, adhesions, or scar tissues and  becomes the root of the soreness and tightness the body will feel.  Incidentally, these side effects become the cause of why the body cannot  recover quickly and prevents continuing of exercise.  </p>  <p>  \t    KRANK  Systems does not want this to prevent you from continuing your exercise  routine and is the reason why we have developed different foam rolling  techniques that will:  </p>  <p>  \t    * Prevent injuries  </p>  <p>  \t    * Reduce muscle friction and inflammation  </p>  <p>  \t    * Soothe tight muscles  </p>  <p>  \t    * Improve range of motion  </p>  <p>  \t    * Improve flexibility and movement  </p>  <p>  \t    * Increase blood flow and circulation to soft tissues  </p>  <p>  \t    * Increase recovery process  </p>  <p>  \t    Not  only will our foam rolling techniques increase the recovery process so  one can work out repeatedly without the soreness yet, it will also  benefit prior to exercising for warming up and preparing the body to  stand each workout.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The Importance of Foam Rolling:</strong>  </p>  <p>  \tThe foam roller is an important tool that gym enthusiasts should own, and knowing how to foam roll can save you a lot of money down the road.  We all want to be pain free and this will certainly help that cause.  Foam rolling, also known as &quot;the poor mans massage&quot; helps release a lot of knots that everyone tends to carry.  It is very important to untangle or release these knots in order for the body to move correctly and efficiently.  It also helps create more blood circulation in the body and helps you achieve a better range of motion (R.O.M) through out your exercises.  </p>  <p>  \tFoam rolling should be done as frequent as possible.  Wouldn&#039;t you want a massage as frequently as possible?  You should strive to roll out before and after workouts.  Roll out anywhere from 10-20 minutes.  </p>  <p>  \t We will also be giving our &quot;Diet and Meal Guidline&quot; to properly fuel your body.  </p>",
