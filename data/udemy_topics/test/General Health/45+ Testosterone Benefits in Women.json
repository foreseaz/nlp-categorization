You feel tired and weak and depressed and you&#039;re dry everywhere. Ugh. Or you&#039;re a husband and you wonder that same about your wife&#039;s loss of muscle tone and absence of libido -- what&#039;s going on? </p><p style=\"\">Take a walk on the wild side with Dr Dan Purser, an MD who&#039;s been involved in years of endocrine (hormone) research, written a textbook on preventive medicine and tons of other books (TEN #1 books), and is a worldwide educator on men&#039;s &amp; women&#039;s health issues. </p><p style=\"\">Learn what the research says through the eyes of this engaging educator as he shares experiences and articles about women and their testosterone, their libido, and their brain and heart. Wonder no more if it&#039;s safe or helps -- this is detailed and backed by references -- and will help you to decide if testosterone should be part of your life and why... </p><p style=\"\">Women explode when they optimize their testosterone levels. </p><p style=\"\">I know this first hand after years as a practicing physician and as an endocrinology researcher and properly treating women who were deficient – dealing with them before and after, and seeing the smiles on their faces when they too <em style=\"\">really</em> realized the wonderful (and SEXY) benefits of testosterone – it was our little secret for them to use with their husband. </p><p style=\"\">The challenge is that there&#039;s all kinds of confusing bad information out there – well this little course cuts through all of that as I discuss each study (studies that I chose as a reason and felt that were significant) and what it means to YOU. And I don&#039;t talk like a physician – above your head with big fancy medical words – I grew up on a farm in Oklahoma and I talk like a regular human being. </p><p style=\"\">Most doctors don&#039;t know these details – but they&#039;re not secret – they just come with the territory for the kind of research I do and books I write.</p><p style=\"\">This disconnect with you the patient by other physicians and their inability to answer questions patients <em style=\"\">really</em> have is why so many doctors are missing out on unlocking the wonders of this incredible hormone and treatment option with their ill female patients. </p><p style=\"\">This course was created to change that attitude and in the past <em style=\"\">has only been available amongst a private, group of elite professionals and high end cash paying patients until now</em>... </p><p style=\"\">This isn&#039;t one of those training programs that gives you some basic theory and sends you out into the trenches only slightly better off then when you started... </p><p style=\"\">By the end of this training you will be armed with hardcore facts about testosterone benefits for women, and an arsenal of proven tactics for optimizing your levels. </p><p style=\"\">Need to discuss testosterone benefits with your personal physician and don&#039;t know where to start? - you&#039;re covered</p><p style=\"\">Your doc doesn&#039;t know what your testosterone levels should be (especially for those women in menopause)? - you&#039;re covered</p><p style=\"\">Your personal physician is not sure how to prescribe and in what form? - you&#039;re covered</p><p style=\"\">Your doctor says it will cause cancer and/or facial hair? - boom, you&#039;ll learn how to disarm that too</p><p style=\"\">This training covers the current and modern peer reviewed research on testosterone benefits for women and the safety issues (which are minimal). </p><p style=\"\">This premium training by a top notch educator is perfect and for years has delivered results for: </p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Women who have muscle wasting and want them to come back</li><li style=\"\">Patients with osteoarthritis or even rheumatoid arthritis and want relief and healing</li><li style=\"\">Women with severe atrophic vaginitis that want it to go away naturally</li><li style=\"\">Women with dry eyes and dry mouths (and super dry and painful <em style=\"\">down there</em>) and want to quit sipping water all day and having to use eye drops constantly</li><li style=\"\">Women with absence of libido who want a love life</li><li style=\"\">Women with unexplained depression – it&#039;s not a fluoxetine deficiency. </li></ul><p style=\"\">When you&#039;re done with this course, starting to feel <em style=\"\">much better</em> will be in reach...as well as the big time intimacy rewards that come with that. </p><p style=\"\">Below you can find out exactly how the training is laid out, but real quick here are the sections: </p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Introduction – Understanding a little bit about who I am, my Credentials, Background, and from what Direction I Speak and Educate</li><li style=\"\">Women Using Testosterone – How to Properly Use Testosterone and What Your Real World Options Are.</li><li style=\"\">Proper Diagnosis – Information and Labs we Need &amp; Get in Research And In My Office to Confirm the Diagnosis</li><li style=\"\">Cardiovascular Benefits of Testosterone For Women – the research and studies and what they say (THEY are HUGE).</li><li style=\"\">Diabetes Benefits – Did you Know Testosterone Helps to Prevent Diabetes?

You have nothing to lose, everything to gain. </p><p style=\"\">Hope to see you on the inside,</p><p style=\"\">-- Dan Purser MD</p><p style=\"\"><em style=\"\">BTW - This training is something I&#039;ve kept off of everything but my own private patient community site for a long time due to wariness of exposing too many practice and research secrets. After finally getting convinced by some patients that more women needed to see it, I decided to put it up here on Udemy. I can&#039;t guarantee I will keep making it available to purchase forever considering my initial concerns, so I&#039;d grab it while you still can.</em></p>",
