The set of 12 moves is extremely effective at reducing stress and increasing the feelings of relaxation.</p><p style=\"\">The moves appear to be very simple but when the correct timing and breathing is applied, they are highly complex and challenging.</p><p style=\"\">Fang song gong&#039;s basic movement is a very relaxed weight shift from leg to leg, lifting the opposite heel, placing the Kidney-One point firmly into the ground (the earth). In a pendulum motion created by the weight shifting, energy is thereby drawn up the leg meridians, especially the Kidney channel.</p><p style=\"\">The 12 moves are easy to learn even by beginners to chi kung. The Hun Yuan system (translated hun yuan means &quot;mixed circles&quot;) is one style of ta chi and has it&#039;s own forms and chi kung routines.</p>",
