I had high cholesterol, my love handles were getting larger all the time, and I had very little energy during the day (even after getting a full night&#039;s sleep). After graduating from college, I went into the work force like everyone else, and signed up at a gym that I was paying waaaaay to much for. But that&#039;s what we&#039;re conditioned to do— go to work, socialize, eat dinner, go home, sleep, and then repeat the cycle. Somewhere in the middle there, we&#039;re supposed to fit in some time to get to the gym. You get into a sedentary lifestyle where you&#039;re not only spending 99% of your day sitting in an office chair, you&#039;re also spending 99% of your free time sitting on a couch watching TV just trying to recover from the work day before you have to wake up and do it all over again. So even if you do manage to squeeze in an hour or two at the gym every week, that just isn&#039;t anywhere near enough time for you to get physically fit and use your body the way it has evolutionarily developed over millions of years. That&#039;s the daily rat race at its finest. DON&#039;T let it turn your physical condition to mush.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              Gyms are great for getting in shape... when you have time to get to one. They provide you with lots of fancy equipment, but that equipment only helps you if you actually have the time to learn to use and master them. There is more than enough time in a typical work day to do more exercise, get better muscle tone, get better mental clarity, and get a better night&#039;s sleep… and you are deserving of all those things. You have to be smarter and more efficient with your time and your body than you currently are. Don&#039;t ask why you&#039;re out of shape or simply excuse it because of “old age.&quot; Ask what you need to do to take control of your own health.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              When I started exercising regularly back in 2004, I felt a lot of pressure to find a way to get physically fit and get some real results. I wish I had an on-line course like OfficeFit to show me basic exercises that I could integrate into my every day life. With my hectic schedule I didn&#039;t have time to go to the gym, so I ended up going once in a while (if ever) anyway.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t              Over time, I have assembled all the knowledge I had gained, did some additional research on the internet, and figured out exactly what exercises were most effective, most efficient, and could be done with no equipment (or minimal equipment). My goal is to teach you several exercises with correct form so you can rely on yourself and assemble your own exercise routine and exercise goals. Most importantly you shouldn&#039;t have to spend thousands of dollars to learn the most basic fundamental exercises that could easily help you get started on the road to fitness. I&#039;ve always believed that one of the most important things in life is to constantly learn new things and that a great education should be easily accessible for a low cost.  </p>",
