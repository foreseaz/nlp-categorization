    "description": "<p>This course is designed for qualified hypnotherapists and NLP practitioners who are interested in learning how to improve their skills to be more effective when working with a client presenting with a specific habit, phobia or compulsion.</p><p>The course will take you from the very first contact over the phone, right through to the end of the first session. You will learn how to ask effective questions, and make a thorough, but concise, assessment to ensure the client is ready and motivated to make the changes during the session. </p><p>The programme shows you how to integrate and implement a number of very effective interventions that are used regularly in my practice, that reliably achieve fast and effective results for clients. These techniques are very easy to learn and execute with clients, and seamlessly flow from one to the next. </p><p>We'll be integrating NLP reframes, anchoring resource states, collapsing problem states, finding and implementing new behaviours, conducting ecology checks, and ensuring effective assessment of the client's commitment to change.</p>",
