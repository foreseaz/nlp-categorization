    "description": "<p>How often do we ignore the signs of dysfunction in our bodies? Joints that don't move in healthy ways gradually wear out or become frozen. The muscles and tendons around them atrophy and before we know it, what was once a supple body now moves more like Frankenstein's Monster. We take our body for granted. We only notice it when it starts having problems or gets injured.</p><p>Your work or sport demands the use of your hands. Now you are experiencing wrist pain. Whether from trauma, tweak or overuse. You are frustrated that nothing has worked to get rid of the discomfort. You have tried painkillers, braces, rest, even massage with limited success. You've even considered surgery, but just really don't want to go that route. </p><p>The Total Wrist Resilience program is a new approach to handling wrist pain so you can keep doing what you need to do. Unlike popping anti-inflammatory pills or wearing a wrist brace, <strong>Total Wrist Resilience addresses the source of your pain rather than cover it up.</strong> </p><p>Most wrist pain protocols aim solely at restricting motion at the joint or stretching muscles. This is a part of the healing process but it misses the major element for long-term wrist health: tendon strength. This is what makes Total Wrist Resilience different from other joint pain protocols. T<strong>his course focuses on using movement to stimulate your natural healing process to repair damage to your joints.</strong> Throughout our lives, the joints of our body undergo a ton of abuse. It is no different for our hands and wrists. Even if you don't currently have joint pain, parts of those tissues may be damaged without you even knowing it.</p><p>This course is the result of my years of experimenting what I am about to share with you. I have worked with numerous experts on the subject of joint health including doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, personal trainers, athletic coaches, and physical therapists.<strong> I have used every one of these exercises and strategies myself to my own wrists healthy.</strong> Now I want to share this information with you.</p><p>This program teaches you how to <strong>strengthen</strong>, <strong>increase flexibility and decrease pain in your wrists</strong>. With easy to follow, step-by-step exercises that are tailored to your needs; Total Wrist Resilience teaches exercises that you can do anywhereâ€”be it at the office, home or at the gym.</p>",
