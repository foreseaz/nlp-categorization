    "description": "<p>\nZika virus has been around for half a century, mostly in\nAfrica and Asia, but now it has hopped across the oceans into the Americas. In\nBrazil alone a million Zika infections have occurred and the number may reach\nup to 4 million over the next year. \nIn this course I will answer the following questions: What is the Zika virus?\nCan we get Zika, living in United States? How do we know if we have Zika virus\ninfection? How to test, treat and prevent Zika? What are the complications of\nthe Zika virus like a small head â€“ microcephaly ? Should pregnancy women and others travel\nto Zika affected areas? What if we are returning from a Zika affected areas? What\ndoes the future hold for Zika virus infection in continental United States?  </p><p>In the course I will provide the latest knowledge about the virus, its complications, its spread along with WHO and CDC recommendations.  With this I will combine my experience of two decades as an  infectious disease physician to bring insight and perspective. Many who have read my newspaper and online articles, watched my TV interviews and listened to my radio conversations has felt relieved and confident with their decisions. </p>As we combat the Zika virus, we do need to be concerned but we need not panic. We must let our knowledge overcomes our fear.<p><br></p><p>Please join us for the\ncourse\n\n<br></p>",
