    "description": "<p>The human body has evolved over an unimaginable amount of time to become what it is today. Unfortunately, modern society does not reflect the movements our ancestors performed on a daily basis.</p><p>We are not designed to sit in chairs and stare at our computer, phone, and television screens. We are built to walk, run, climb, swing, throw, and play everyday. When we sacrifice these natural movements patterns in daily life, our posture suffers.</p><p>When alignment and posture become compromised, our other body systems cannot perform correctly. We begin to develop issues in other areas such as our digestive, muscular, respiratory, nervous and circulatory system. This will not only affect our bodies, but our minds as well. </p><p>To address posture, we must shift they way we look at movement in day to day life. We must acquire a basic understand for of the human body and what it looks like underneath the skin. We must build a strong sense of mind-body awareness and regain control.</p><p>In this course, we will first discuss what proper alignment is and why we loose our ability to move over time. We will then go over basic concepts in regards to human biomechanics and how we develop specific muscular patterns. </p><p>Once you understand the core concepts, we will break down each major joint of the body including the spine, hips, shoulders, arms, wrists, fingers, legs, ankles, toes, ribs, and jaw. With each joint, will go over basic anatomy, postural issues, how to release tension and how to promote proper alignment.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will have the tools and techniques to address your specific postural issues and what it takes to fix them. </p><p>Through restoring posture, you can alleviate joint pain, perform daily movements with ease and live life to the fullest.</p>",
