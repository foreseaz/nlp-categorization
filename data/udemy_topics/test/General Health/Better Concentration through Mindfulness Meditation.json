They find that meditating regularly, even for short periods of time, can help to improve one’s mental and physical well-being. Mindfulness helps to reduce stress, feelings of fear and tiredness. Mindfulness helps to lower blood pressure and pulse. The brain waves change and make the brain calmer and at the same time more productive.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Course Contents</strong> <br>  \t   + Introduction about mindfulness  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  + Worksheets to define one’s own goals, plans and tracking  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  + Video-based exercises for beginners and more advanced users  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  + Recommended reading and further resources<br>  \t<br>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Meditation Topics</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Best posture for meditation  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Concentration exercises in four stages  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Dealing with anxiety before important situations  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  Improving focus to be more present with family  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong></strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Meditation for the Active Lives</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong>Meditation comes from the East. It developed in India and China and has been passed on and further developed over thousands of years. YOU Productions brings the methods from Vipassana Meditation and tailors them for people with busy lives. These meditations are neutral and secular. We’re not promoting a guru or historical persona. These meditations are designed to deal with the issues of a modern society. They are short and guided to address the needs of people with busy lives.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t  That’s why they’re called „YOU“. Because, it’s about you. It’s for you. It’s by you. And it has to come from You.  </p>",
