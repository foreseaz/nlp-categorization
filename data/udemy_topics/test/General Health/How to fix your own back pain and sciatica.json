I have had numerous injuries over the years and even had a procedure about 8 years ago that gave some relief. The pain had returned in force over the past few months due to a recent injury. I began doing the exercises just about 4 days ago and have had improvement. I am actually sleeping through the night again. I highly recommend this course if you are dealing with back pain or even if you just want to learn how to keep your spine pain free.
