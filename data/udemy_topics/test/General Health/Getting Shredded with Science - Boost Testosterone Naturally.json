It is well known that healthy and normal testosterone levels help you lose weight faster, gain muscle mass and prevent disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This class covers an overview of the base supplement stack you should be using on a daily basis. We will also look at which supplements, including herbs, minerals, and prehormones, actually work for raising testosterone and which ones are scams. Learn which supplements you need to cycle and which ones you don’t.  I'm also including the megaguide on sleep optimization that covers how to measure sleep quality and hacks to improve sleep enough to impact testosterone production.</p>",
