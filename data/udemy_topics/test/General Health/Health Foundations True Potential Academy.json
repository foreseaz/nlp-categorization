    "description": "<p>This is one of five modules in <strong>True Potential Academy</strong>.</p><p>It was designed because as a Life Coach I was asked the same basic questions over and over again and decided to put it all together in one place for everyone to see.</p><p>It will teach you basics that I have learned from people like <strong>Eben Pagan, Dave Asprey and Tony Robbins and have implemented them into my own life</strong>.</p><p><strong><u> Obviously health isn't a one fits all system</u></strong> , and different people are intolerant to different foods, but this will give you a general idea on what foods to avoid (or lower their intake), what to eat, when and how to sleep, how to properly breathe and how much to drink.</p><p><br></p><p>I also included Bonuses, PDF's with exercises and Weekly Tracker where you are able to track which activities you have completed each day (goes hand to hand with TPA Productivity course.)</p>",
