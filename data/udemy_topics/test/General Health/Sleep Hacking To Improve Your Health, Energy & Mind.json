I was frustrated and I needed more time to achieve more so I decided to study and experiment. </p><p>Through numerous self-experimentations and optimizations over the last few years, I've cut down my sleep time down to exactly 6 hours of sleep and I've never had more energy. If you consider this change over a year, that's more than 4 weeks of additional time THAT I GET TO SPEND DOING THINGS I WANT &amp; LOVE.</p><p>What would you do with 4 additional weeks this year? Does this sound interesting to you? <em>How would you spend it?</em></p><p>I wanted to help everyone interested in having more time and energy by sharing this lecture with them so that they too can get so much more done.</p><p>In this course you will learn:</p><ul><li>Achieving quality sleep so you actually feel fresh </li><li>A bunch of simple (and unique!) stuff you can do with light to get more energy and far better sleep</li><li>How altering your activeness, consumption, &amp; environment can make a huge difference</li><li>The best ways to fall asleep to prevent yourself from waking up throughout the night </li><li>A blueprint to take action on everything in this course so that you can hack your sleep in no time at all </li></ul><p>The class is delivered in easy to follow video modules that are broken up into numerous parts so that you can go at a speed that you're comfortable with.</p><p>No matter who you are, I guarantee you'll learn at least one thing from this class. Important Note: if you're a chronic insomniac you should seek some professional guidance instead of taking a course on this. </p><p>Hack your sleep today and get tons of time back in your life!</p>",
