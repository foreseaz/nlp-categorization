This isn&#039;t because a person is\r\nweak-willed or a loser.&nbsp; It&#039;s because it\r\ntakes time to understand one&#039;s own, unique smoking habit and to develop and\r\ncarry out a plan to stop smoking that makes sense.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This “essential quit smoking tips: best way to quit smoking “course is designed to help you get rid of nicotine addiction and\r\nalso address the reasons for your unique smoking pattern.&nbsp;\r\nLike walking on a road, this course consists of many steps that prepare\r\na smoker for Quit Day -- the day one chooses to stop smoking forever. The steps\r\nare grouped into seven modules (listed on this web page below), each containing\r\na brief video lecture and a PDF that can be read online or downloaded\r\n(instructor recommended).&nbsp; There are also\r\nsome downloadable MP3s.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is based on\r\nscientific and medical research and reputable stop-smoking programs, such as\r\nthose offered by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Centers for\r\nDisease Control and Prevention, and the lung, heart, and cancer\r\nassociations.&nbsp; The course does not\r\ninvolve hypnosis, nor does it require students to buy any special foods or\r\ngadgets.&nbsp; However, it does require that\r\nstudents commit to spending a few weeks focusing their attention on the\r\ncourse.&nbsp; As a symbol of that commitment,\r\nthe course fee is the cost of about three packs of cigarettes, or $15 USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that\r\nstopping smoking involves progressing through stages of increasing readiness\r\nand resolve to quit.&nbsp; So, even if you are\r\nnot sure you are ready to stop smoking, this course can work for you because it\r\nwill teach you about the stop-smoking process should the day ever come that you\r\ndecide to quit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instructor is a\r\ncollege professor of health and wellness, co-author with Professor Gordon Edlin\r\nof the successful college text, Health and Wellness, and is certified by the\r\nAmerican Lung Association as a smoking cessation counselor.&nbsp; He has been teaching personal health and\r\nsmoking cessation online for over 12 years; he brings that background and\r\nexperience to this Essential Quit Smoking Tips course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take this Essential Quit Smoking Tips course and learn the best way to quit smoking now!</p>&lt;/p&gt;",
