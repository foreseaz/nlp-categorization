    "description": "<p>Hadoop is a hot new technology that is growing everyday in its adaption in the Big Data world. However, Hadoop is built using Java and application developers need to know/learn Java for developing MapReduce applications. Python is a very popular programming language that makes the development of applications simple and easy. Hadoop provides a way by which MapReduce applications can be built using Python. This way, developers can use existing knowledge and code base for quickly developing MapReduce applications. </p><p>This intent of this course is to help Python developers learn the concepts and techniques for developing real world applications in Hadoop. It walks the learner through 5 examples of increasing difficulty for mastering MapReduce through Python.</p>",
