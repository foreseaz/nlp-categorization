    "description": "<p>One of the most important tasks we undertake in Linux is processing text in files. This course explores two powerful tools we have to do this: grep and sed. Grep and sed find and manipulate text in files using regular expressions, which use special characters for searching and replacing text.</p>\n\n<p>In the course, we’ll introduce regular expression syntax in the context of learning grep, then apply what we’ve learned as we work with sed. Topics include:</p>\n\n<p>- finding text with grep<br>- regular expression syntax<br>- meta characters<br>- validating emails and phone numbers<br><br></p><p>This course is the lite version of our Learn GREP and SED on Linux for Beginners course.</p><p>Hope you enjoy this course.</p>",
