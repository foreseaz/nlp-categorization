    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Teach Excel to Do Your Work FOR YOU. . .</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMicrosoft Office is everywhere, installed on over 750 million computers, but most users only know how to set up a basic table or maybe even do a few formulas here and there.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tIn my course, I teach you how to take Excel by the horns and make it do whatever you want, whenever you want. It can go through loads of information and create a printable report for you. You can make custom forms so that you can access, analyze, edit, or add new information quickly to your data tables/ worksheets.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tExcel programming utilizes a simple but effective tool called &quot;VBA&quot; - the hidden programming language that runs quietly in the background while you work. Itâ€™s very easy and straight-forward to use.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tI&#039;ll show you the easiest tricks to learn this basic language in a fun, progressive method. Learn at your own pace. With each of my short, info-packed lectures, you&#039;ll learn another essential skill that you can immediately use. You&#039;ll find yourself handling these Automation tools instantly and in any spreadsheet you already use every day. If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;m good at - and my students are good at - it&#039;s AUTOMATION.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tMy motto is, &quot;If I&#039;m not making everybody&#039;s job easier, quicker and more enjoyable, I don&#039;t deserve to have this job&quot; - and that&#039;s what I live by.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tTake this course and access your true potential.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tOh, and I want to be the first to hear about your New Raise you get once you&#039;re making Excel Programs and running everything on autopilot for your co-workers!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t-Dan  </p>",
