Many contemporary programming languages are based on C. Learning C first makes studying other languages such as Java, php, and Swift much simpler. C is still a very popular programming language after more than 40 years<br><br>In this class, we'll explore the programming language other than is normally taught. We are going to begin with datatypes (of program). Understanding the fundamental character of arithmatic operators and couple of other areas in C. <br><br>The class comprises 30 minutes of lectures. </p><p>This course is the lite version of our main course i.e. \"C Programming for Beginners - Go from Zero to Hero!\"</p><p>Here Is What what you'll learn in this course:<br><br>- command-line arguments</p><p>- Primitive Types<br></p><p>-  Arithmaetic operators<br><br>So why wait... sign up today!</p>",
