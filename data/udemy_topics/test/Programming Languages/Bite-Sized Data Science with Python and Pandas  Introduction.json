    "description": "<p><strong>Learn the basics of data science with Python, with this short course designed for students to follow along, and built around a concrete, real-world dataset</strong>.</p><p>Listening to theoretical examples is never fun, and I've always liked actually applying what I learn to concrete examples, so this course is <strong>built around us analyzing a real-life dataset together</strong>. The dataset we'll be using is the <em>\"Parkinson's Disease Telemedicine dataset\"</em>, and our goal will be to see if we can predict the severity of Parkinson's Disease in patients from just a dozen simple measurements, which would be a vast improvement over the current time consuming process that doctors and patients have to go through.<br></p><p>This course will provide a good introduction to several different aspects of data science, and all in Python, one of the most popular and powerful languages used by data scientists today.</p><p>You'll learn how to:</p><p> - Set up your data analysis research environment (in an iPython notebook)</p><p> - Visualize the data to understand it better</p><p> - Manipulate and transform data to prepare it for modeling</p><p> - Apply a statistical model to the data</p><p>The course is comprised of short lectures which walk you through the data analysis, as you follow along. There are also several coding exercises throughout to test your knowledge!</p><p><strong>Check out the course to learn data science with Python today!</strong><br></p>",
