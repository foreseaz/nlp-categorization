The field traverses through Computer Science, Programming, Information Theory, Statistics and Artificial Intelligence. College/University courses in this field are expensive. Becoming a Data Scientist through self-study is challenging since it requires going through multiple books, websites, searches and exercises and you will still end up feeling &quot;not complete&quot; at the end of it. So how do you <strong style=\"\">acquire full-stack Data Science skills</strong> that will get you a and give you the confidence to execute it?</p><p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Big Data Science with Hadoop</strong> addresses the problem. This course provides extensive, end-to-end coverage of all activities performed in a Data Science project. If teaches application of the latest techniques in data acquisition, transformation and predictive analytics to solve real world business problems. The goal of this course is to teach practice rather than theory. Rather than deep dive into formula and derivations, it focuses on using existing libraries and tools to produce solutions. It also keeps things simple and easy to understand.</p><p style=\"\">Through this course, we strive to make you fully equipped to become a developer who can execute full fledged Data Science projects. By taking this course, you will</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Appreciate what Data Science really is</li><li style=\"\">Understand the Data Science Life Cycle</li><li style=\"\">Learn Apache Hadoop, Map Reduce, Pig, Mahout and Hive.</li><li style=\"\">Apply  Hadoop technologies for executing Data Science Projects</li><li style=\"\">Master the application of Analytics and Machine Learning techniques</li></ul><strong style=\"\">Big Data and Data Science go hand in hand </strong>and this is a great course to learn both !!<p style=\"\"><strong style=\"\">Please note: This course only covers Hadoop components as-required for Data Science.
