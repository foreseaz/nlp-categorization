This course is for those people who want an fun way to learn programming. This course is for people who want to brush up on their basics but don&#039;t want to read a boring old textbook. This course will is centered around learning the Java programming language through game development. Specifically, we will be creating the old school game breakout. Split into sections revolving around the different elements of the game, key programming concepts will be taught and explained throughout the course.  We&#039;ll move from setting up our game board to creating and making the game pieces move to adding levels learning concepts like enumeration, conditionals, loops, object oriented programming, abstract classes/methods and more.  </p>  <p>  \t      By the end of this course you will not only have created an amazing game to show off but you will have the Java basics fully understood. This will give you the opportunity to explore deeper into java and other languages. Most importantly, I hope to give you desire to create and to see your projects and programs used by others. It&#039;s and amazing feeling trust me!  </p>  <p>  \t      As for the course length, the course classes are relatively short so take as much time as you need to create an amazing game!  </p>",
