Never fear, we have a detailed video on how to get this downloaded and set up.</li><li>Hundreds of lines of source code, and hundreds of lines of comments - just download and open in your IDE!</li></ul><p><em><strong>A Java course for everyone - accessible yet serious, to take you from absolute beginner to an early intermediate level</strong></em></p><p>Let’s parse that.</p><ul><li>This is a Java course for <strong>everyone</strong>. Whether you are a complete beginner (a liberal arts major, an accountant, doctor, lawyer) or an engineer with some programming experience but looking to learn Java - this course is right for you.</li><li>The course is <strong>accessible</strong> because it assumes absolutely no programming knowledge, and quickly builds up using first principles alone</li><li>Even so, this is a <strong>serious</strong> Java programming class - the gradient is quite steep, and you will go from absolute beginner to an early intermediate level</li><li>The course is also <strong>quirky</strong>. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.</li></ul><p><strong>What's Covered:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Programming Basics:</strong> What programming is, and a carefully thought-through tour of the basics of any programming. Installing and setting up an IDE and writing your first program</li><li><strong>The Object-Oriented Paradigm: </strong>Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Inheritance; how an OO mindset differs from a functional or imperative programming mindset; the mechanics of OO - access modifiers, dynamic dispatch, abstract base classes v interfaces. The underlying principles of OO: encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism</li><li><strong>Threading and Concurrency: </strong>A deep and thorough study of both old and new ways of doing threading in Java: Runnables, Callables, Threads, processes, Futures, Executors.</li><li><strong>Reflection, Annotations</strong>: The how, what and why - also the good and bad</li><li><strong>Lambda Functions:</strong> Functional constructs that have made the crossover into the mainstream of Java - lambda functions, aggregate operators.</li><li><strong>Modern Java constructs:</strong> Interface default methods;  also detailed coverage of Futures and Callables, as well as of Lambda functions, aggregation operators and Swing.</li><li><strong>Packages and Jars: </strong>The plumbing is important to understand too.</li><li><strong>Language Features:</strong> Serialisation; why the Cloneable interface sucks; exception handling; the immutability of Strings; the Object base class; primitive and object reference types; pass-by-value and pass-by-object-reference.</li><li><strong>Design</strong>: The MVC Paradigm.</li><li><strong>Swing</strong>: Framework basics; JFrames, JPanels and JComponents; Menus and menu handling; Trees and their nuances; File choosers, buttons, browser controls.</li></ul><p><strong>Programming Drills</strong><em><strong> (code-alongs, with source code included)</strong></em></p><ul><li><strong>Serious stuff:</strong><ul><li>A <strong>daily stock quote summariser:</strong> scrapes the internet, does some calculations, and outputs a nice, formatted Excel spreadsheet.</li><li>A <strong>News Curation app </strong>to summarise newspaper articles into a concise email snippet using serious Swing programming</li></ul></li><li><strong>Simple stuff:</strong><ul><li>Support with choosing a programming environment; downloading and setting up IntelliJ.</li><li>Simple hello-world style programs in functional, imperative and object-oriented paradigms.</li><li>Maps, lists, arrays. Creating, instantiating and using objects, interfaces</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything -<strong> anything! </strong>- and we will always reply :-)</li></ul>",
