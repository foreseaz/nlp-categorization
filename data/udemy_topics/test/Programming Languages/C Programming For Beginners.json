    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">The <em style=\"\">fastest, easiest</em> way to learn to program C on a Mac or Windows</strong>. This course will teach you to program the C language from the ground up. You will learn everything from the very fundamentals of programming right through to the complexities of pointers, addresses and File IO. Maybe you&#039;ve tried to master C before but failed. Or maybe you are new to C or new to programming. If so, this is the course for you!  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     C is one of the most important of all programming languages. It is used to program desktop applications, compilers, tools and utilities and even hardware devices. The C language is fast and efficient – but it can be hard to learn. Unless you use this course. This course begins with a gentle introduction to C but quickly moves on to explain some of its most confusing features: everything from C&#039;s &#039;scoping&#039; rules to the curious connection between arrays and memory addresses. By the end of the course you will have a deep understanding both of the C language itself and also of the underlying &#039;architecture&#039; of your computer.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">What you will learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">The fundamentals of programming – from the ground up</li>  \t<li style=\"\">How to program on a Mac or on Windows</li>  \t<li style=\"\">The nitty-gritty details of the C language</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Advanced topics such as memory allocation, the stack and heap, and binary file IO</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t<strong style=\"\">Who should take the course</strong>  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Beginners – if you&#039;ve never coded before, you can learn C step by step</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Programmers switching to C from some other language such as Java, Ruby or Python</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Cross-platform developers – there are C compilers for all major operating systems</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Anyone who needs to program C++ or Objective-C.
