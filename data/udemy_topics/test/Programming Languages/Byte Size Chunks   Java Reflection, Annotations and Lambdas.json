It starts from zero, builds up the design, then gives plenty of real-world examples, but crisply and quickly.</li><li>The course is also quirky. The examples are irreverent. Lots of little touches: repetition, zooming out so we remember the big picture, active learning with plenty of quizzes. There’s also a peppy soundtrack, and art - all shown by studies to improve cognition and recall.</li></ul><p><strong>What's Covered:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Reflection</strong>: The how, what and why - also the good and bad</li><li><strong>Annotations</strong>: Custom and built-in annotations, and how they save effort and prevent bugs</li><li><strong>Lambda Functions</strong>: Functional constructs that have made the crossover into the mainstream of Java - lambda functions, aggregate operators.</li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything - anything! - and we will always reply :-)</li></ul>",
