    "description": "<p>Scratch is a visual programming language. Through easy to use drag and drop blocks, one can build games, animations and stories in Scratch. It is a great way to learn about programming and is generally used to teach kids basics of programming. But it can be used by anyone to develop games of increasing complexity. Scratch allows the use of event-driven programming with active objects called \"sprites\".</p><p> In this course, we will go from the basics of scratch all the way to development of games in Scratch. Ever wanted to design a game but found programming too hard. Well Scratch makes game development easy to learn and fun to create. In order to take this course, you need Scratch installed on your machine and an interest in learning how to program and develop games/animations in general. </p><p>By the end of this course, we will be able to build animations and games in Scratch. Learn and master this visual programming language in just over 13 lectures. This course was designed to be understood by absolute beginners with no/little experience in programming.</p>",
