Therefore it is priced accordingly and is not as comprehensive as the other 6-hour courses for over $99+</strong></p>  <p>  \t              By the end of this course you will have completed a customizable working AngularJS application.  I cover all the essentials of AngularJS.  </p>  <p>  \t                    I read and studied a lot to prepare this course, but let me warn you, it's fast-paced.  Since it's on video, you can pause it and rewind, but if it were to be slow-paced, you wouldn't want to fast-forward possibly skipping some server-saving code.  </p>  <p>  \t                    You will learn all the goodies and \"magic\" brought to you by the creator Mi≈°ko Hevery.  Seriously, he has permanently changed how web apps are created, let's just call it a \"paradigm shift\" as a philosopher would call it.  </p>  <p>  \t                    By the end of this course you'll know if AngularJS is for you.  </p>",
