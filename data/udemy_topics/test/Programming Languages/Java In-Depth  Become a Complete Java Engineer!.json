    "description": "<p><strong>Updates on June 27: First four lectures on Concurrency (Multi-threading) have been uploaded. More multi-threading lectures will be added by July 1st!</strong> <br></p>\n\n<p>Would you like to just acquire core Java skills or would you like to become a complete and a professional Java engineer right at the end of the course. If it is latter, then you should read on ... <br></p>\n\n<p>This comprehensive <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">project-based</em></strong> course has been designed with following objectives:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To help you get an in-depth understanding of both <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">core      </strong>&amp; <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">advanced </strong>concepts in Java</li><li>To teach <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">best practices</strong>      &amp; <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">key design principles</strong> for writing effective Java programs</li><li>To help you gain practical      experience in writing professional-level code via instructor-led      implementation of a project. Project is implemented in <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Eclipse</strong> using <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">MVC</strong> design pattern, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">TDD</strong>      (Test-Driven Development) principles and other best practices</li><li>To help you understand      the inner workings of Java platform (aka <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">JVM</strong>)</li><li>To teach how to effectively use      <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Eclipse IDE</strong> to write, debug,      and test Java programs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The motivation behind these objectives is to help you in becoming a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">complete</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">&amp;</strong> <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">industry-ready engineer</strong>. Most Java courses focus only on teaching core fundamentals, which at the very best equip students with good basic skills to work on small-to-medium sized projects. Most of these students fall short when it comes to implementing more complex projects. To design elegant solutions for large, complex projects one needs to have a much deeper understanding of language features along with knowledge of the recommended best practices &amp; design principles. More importantly one needs to know how to put all of these into practice. This <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">comprehensive one-stop project-based course</em></strong> has been designed to equip students with these skills. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Course Specifics</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course begins by giving a birds-eye view of Java covering everything from origin of Java to installing Java and writing your first Java program. Even the most fundamental concepts like compilation &amp; interpretation are explained. All other topics are covered in-depth starting from language basics, object-oriented concepts (including relevant Java 8 features), JVM, exceptions, IO, data structures, generics, multi-threading, nested classes, enums, and annotations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each lecture has been very carefully crafted. <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Motivation </em>behind every concept is clearly explained with well thought out examples and nice animations. Object-oriented concepts like inheritance &amp; polymorphism are explained through a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">real-world case-study</em></strong>, which is also implemented as part of the course project. Every concept has been well-tested through ready-to-run, downloadable <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">demo programs</em></strong>, which are implemented and executed in the course. Every chapter ends with a carefully crafted <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">quiz</em> to test what was learnt.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The course project simulates a real-world product that is based on bookmarking concept. The project is instructor-led and is implemented using proper <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">coding conventions &amp; best practices</em>. The project incorporates <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">MVC</em> design pattern and uses <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Test-Driven Development (TDD</em>) methodology. The entire project is implemented using the popular Eclipse IDE. There is also a separate dedicated chapter just for learning Eclipse IDE. It will give you a solid foundation in using Eclipse to effectively <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">write</em>, <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">debug</em>, and <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">test </em>Java programs. The chapter includes lessons to use Eclipse's debugger &amp; JUnit unit testing framework.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the course also discusses several best practices/design rules outlined in the popular Effective Java book. This is one of the highlights of the course and will make you truly complete!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">About the Instructor &amp; On His Motivation for Building This Course</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have over <em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">10</em>\n years of experience in Java developing complex data integration &amp; \nmining software for start-ups in silicon valley and elsewhere. After \nworking for so many years with many excellent engineers, I realized that\n sometimes we fell short of developing the most effective solutions to \nsome of the problems we were dealing with. This sometimes led to several\n rounds of refactoring resulting in loss of valuable time. This made me \nrealize that it was a result of not being taught Java programming in the\n right way. I realized that a more <em>holistic</em> approach to teaching Java is\n needed where the language features are taught along with the best \npractices &amp; design principles that any serious developer must know. \nThis course is a result of this realization and it has taken me around <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">2 years of full-time effort</em></strong>\n (considered equivalent to a decade if working on a part-time basis) in \ndeveloping it. Building this course itself has been a wonderful journey \nfor me and I hope you will also find this course to be equally \nenriching. I will continue to devote myself in building this course \ntowards making it one of the <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><em class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">best Java courses</em></strong> out there. Always, feel free to message me if you have any questions and I promise to address them as quickly as I can.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\"><br></strong></p>",
