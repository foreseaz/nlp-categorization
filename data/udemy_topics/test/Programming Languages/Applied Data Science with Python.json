The field traverses through Computer Science, Programming, Information Theory, Statistics and Artificial Intelligence. College/University courses in this field are expensive.<strong style=\"\"> Becoming a Data Scientist through self-study is challenging</strong> since it requires going through multiple books, websites, searches and exercises and you will still end up feeling &quot;not complete&quot; at the end of it. So how do you <strong style=\"\">acquire full-stack Data Science skills</strong> that will get you a and give you the <strong style=\"\">confidence </strong>to execute it?</p><p style=\"\">Applied Data Science with Python addresses the problem. This course provides <strong style=\"\">extensive, end-to-end coverage</strong> of all activities performed in a Data Science project. If teaches application of the latest techniques in data acquisition, transformation and predictive analytics to solve real world business problems. The goal of this course is to teach <strong style=\"\">practice </strong>rather than theory. Rather than deep dive into formulae and derivations, it focuses on using existing libraries and tools to produce solutions. It also keeps things <strong style=\"\">simple and easy</strong> to understand.</p><p style=\"\">Through this course, we strive to make you fully equipped to become a developer who can execute full fledged Data Science projects. By taking this course, you will</p><ul style=\"\"><li style=\"\">Appreciate what Data Science really is</li><li style=\"\">Understand the Data Science Life Cycle</li><li style=\"\">Learn to use Python for executing Data Science Projects</li><li style=\"\">Master the application of Analytics and Machine Learning techniques</li><li style=\"\">Gain insight into how Data Science works through end-to-end use cases.</li></ul><p style=\"\">By becoming a student of V2 Maestros, you will also get maximum discounts on all of our other current and future courses (coupon codes inside the course material).
