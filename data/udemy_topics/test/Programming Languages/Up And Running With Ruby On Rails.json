    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t             We start by deploying a <strong style=\"\">Ruby on Rails</strong> application to production. We do that really quickly starting from nothing using all the tools in the box: <strong style=\"\">rails</strong>, <strong style=\"\">bundler</strong>, <strong style=\"\">git</strong>, <strong style=\"\">heroku</strong>, and URL forwarding.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t             Once we have our application in production, we take a deeper look at all the parts that were necessary to make it happen.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t   If you are just beginning with Ruby on Rails and you want to learn the full development workflow, <strong style=\"\">from zero to production</strong>, then you should enjoy this course.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">The Philosophy Of The Course</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            All the lectures are screencasts. This course focuses on the technologies and the practical work that goes into deploying a Rails application to production. The course values exact information and productivity.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t       We will be using the command line for almost everything. If you are not comfortable using the command line, you might want to <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommandlineHowto\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">read up</a> before you start.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t <strong style=\"\">The Computer Setup</strong>  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            I am using Ubuntu to demo everything and I encourage you to use it as well. You can easily run Ubuntu alongside your current OS or from a USB stick. <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">Download Ubuntu 13.10 here</a>.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     You could also stick with your current OS: the workflow demonstrated in this course should be very similar on other flavors of Linux or on Mac OS X.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t     Section 2 will spend a little bit of time talking about Ubuntu and the general computer setup. Feel free to use the course discussions if you have questions or problems.  </p>",
