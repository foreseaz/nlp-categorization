These examples will help you understand that.</strong></p><p><strong>Let's parse that.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>C++ seems intimidating</strong> because all too often, what you see is <strong>not</strong> what you get.</li></ul><ul><li>Usually, that's because <strong>C++ is trying to help you, but you don't realise that.</strong> C++ is incredibly deep, and it sometimes struggles to get you - the programmer - to understand what it's saying</li></ul><ul><li>These examples will help. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a specific C++ use-case. <strong>Each example is simple, but not simplistic.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>What's Included:</strong><br></p><ul><li><strong>Templates</strong> are a classic generic programming technique that were revolutionary when first added to C++. Understand template functions and classes, as well as template specializations.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>STL</strong> - the Standard Template Library - is incredibly powerful. Get a good sense of collections, iterators and algorithms - the major components of the STL</li></ul><ul><li><strong>C++ casts </strong>are quite different than C-casts. Understand const_cast, static_cast and dynamic_cast, as well as Real Time Type Identification (RTTI), and the manner in which explicit conversions can be performed using static_cast</li></ul><p><strong>Talk to us!</strong></p><ul><li>Mail us about anything - <strong>anything!</strong> - and we will always reply :-)</li></ul>",
