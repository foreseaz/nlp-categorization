    "description": "<p><strong>Updated on August 12, 2015</strong>. Added a new lecture on fast class factories.</p><p><strong><em>Indispensable for the beginning pro </em></strong><em>This course is basically the next step for any intermediate C# developer. This is the stuff my teachers never had time for in school, but after applying a couple of these simple tweaks, I got my sluggish methods to run 20 times faster - <strong>Niels</strong></em></p><p>Over 400 students have already enrolled and have left 5-star reviews. The course has been recently updated in August 2015.</p><p> <strong>BEST COURSE CHOICE for beginners and intermediate C# developers who want to take their programming skills to the next level. </strong></p><p>Do you know how to write fast C# code? </p><p>You may have already enrolled in a C# programming course, or learned the language at school or university. But here's a sobering fact: most courses only teach you how to write code, not how to write <strong>fast</strong> code.</p><p>The .NET Framework is huge. For any given problem there are many solutions, and it is not always clear which solution is the best choice.</p><p>Did you know that adding strings together using the wrong Framework class will slow down your code by <strong>a factor of more than two hundred</strong><strong>?</strong> And if you're not handling exceptions the right way, your code wil run a mind-boggling <strong>thousand times slower</strong> than normal. </p><p>Slow C# code is a big problem. Slow code on the web <strong>will not scale</strong> to thousands of users. Slow code will make your user interface <strong>unusable</strong>. Slow code will make your mobile apps <strong>languish</strong> in the app store.</p><p>Slow code is holding you back!</p><p><span></span><strong>I can help you.</strong></p><p><strong></strong>In a series of short lectures I will cover many common performance bottlenecks. I will introduce each problem, and then write a small test program to measure the baseline performance. Then I will demonstrate each possible solution, and benchmark how each solution measures up. </p><p>But there's more! I will also dive into Common Intermediate Code (CIL), the language that the C# compiler compiles to. If this sounds daunting, don't worry! The CIL language is actually very easy to read and understand. I'll take you through the basics in a quick 15-minute lecture.</p><p>Being able to read CIL code is a very useful skill that will help you avoid many performance pitfalls and give you a deeper understanding of the .NET Framework.</p><p><strong>Why should you take this course?</strong></p><p>You should take this course if you are a beginner or intermediate C# developer and want to take your skills to the next level. All my lectures are very easy to follow, and I explain all topics with clear code and many instructive diagrams. </p><p>Or you might be working on a critical section of code in a C# project, and need to make your code run as fast as possible. The tips and tricks in this course will help you immensely. </p><p>Or maybe you're preparing for a C# related job interview? This course will give you an excellent foundation to answer any performance-related questions they might throw at you.</p><p><strong>30 day money-back guarantee</strong></p><p><em>This course comes with an unconditional, Udemy backed, 30-day money-back guarantee.
