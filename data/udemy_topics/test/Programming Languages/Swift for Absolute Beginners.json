Then you have to learn Objective-C or Swift - there is no other way.  </p>  <p>  \t Swift is an awesome, innovative programming language. It will be released in the fall of 2014. It is different because it makes it easier to write applications for iOS and OSX. It is also suitable for beginners.  </p>  <p>  \t Have you found iOS Development difficult to understand? That will not happen with Swift - you will be amazed once you see how easy it is to work with this new language! Playgrounds allow you to instantly start programming in Swift, without any prior knowledge of XCode, the OS architecture or frameworks.  </p>  <p>  \t You will learn the basic concepts and functions of this innovative and modern programming language. This is not only an introduction to Swift - the course will also lay the stepping stones in your path of learning different aspects and various details of the programming language.  </p>  <p>  \t You will work with instructor Tim Schneider during the Swift video tutorial. You will take your first steps in writing with the use of Swift - a programming language used to develop for iPhone, iPad and OSX app developers worldwide.  </p>  <p>  \t With the completion of this instructional video course, you will have a comprehensive knowledge of Swift - you will know what is it used for and, more importantly, you will know how to use it.  </p>  <p>  \t Do not be afraid to ask: you will certainly have a few questions along the way. The instructor will always be available to answer. You will be able to communicate directly with the authors; moreover, you will also be able to communicate with other students who enrolled in this course.  </p>  <p>  \t More testimonials:  </p>  <p>  \t <em style=\"\">Thank you for such good lessons! – Basem Shawky</em>  </p>  <p>  \t <em style=\"\">I like so much this course.
