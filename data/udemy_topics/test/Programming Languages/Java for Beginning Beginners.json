In fact, here at LearnToProgram, we found just about anybody can learn to code.  With a little bit of effort, time and this course you can be writing programs in the Java programming language.<br></p><p>The problem with many so-called beginner's courses is that they assume prerequisite knowledge that many don't have. These courses use too much jargon and are overly complex for beginners.  <strong>Java for Beginning Beginners is different.</strong></p><p>Especially designed for the total beginner-- even someone who's never written a line of code in their life-- <strong>Java for Beginning Beginners</strong> doesn't use complex jargon or assume any prerequisite knowledge.  You'll start by obtaining the free tools you need to create Java programs, and then write very simple programs.</p><p>Gradually, Andrew, your instructor will take you through the step-by-step process of adding new commands to your code vocabulary.  By the end of this course you'll be ready to study more advanced Java courses, or just write Java programs on your own, learning more a long the way.</p><p>This course can be completed in less time than it takes to <span>read a complex novel.  You'll stay engaged with interesting demonstrations and lectures and retain information by completing the lab exercises through out the course.<br></span></p><p>If you've tried other courses but found them difficult to understand-- or simply want the best experience for your first programming course, <strong>Java for Beginning Beginners</strong><span> is hard to beat!</span></p><p><span><br></span></p>",
