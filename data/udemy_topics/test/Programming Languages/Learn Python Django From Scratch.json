It emphasises simplicity and readability, and has almost endless uses in all areas from GUI programing to web programming and everything in between.</p><p><strong>PyCharm</strong>: PyCharm is a smart code editor that supports Python and a number of other languages like JavaScript, CSS and more. It is an Integrated Development Environment that provides code analysis, graphical debugging, intergrated unit testing, and supports web development with Django.</p><p><strong>Git:</strong> Git is a free and open source version control system, designed to handle both small and large projects with speed and data integrity.
