So, this course can be followed by any Windows, Mac OS, or Linux user. </strong>  </p>  <p>  \t                                This course is designed to teach C programming through small classroom projects, in an informal way. All the basic topics including the difficult ones like string handling, files, structures, pointers, linked lists, and command-line arguments are covered, though you may not find them listed in an organized manner in the titles that you see down here.  There are also over a 100 questions grouped into 37 quizzes to reinforce the concepts.</p><p><strong>Do not miss out on this opportunity to learn something special!</strong><br></p><p><em><strong>Noteworthy comments by learners:</strong></em></p><p>I<em> really liked the fact that this course is not as slow as most programming courses which get boring after a little while...All in all it was a fun and awesome course, I will for sure be following other courses from the same teacher --<strong>Alessandro Bassi</strong></em></p><p><em>A good Place to learn C basics...course gives huge opportunity to know ones weakness in C programming. A consecutive lecture and quiz series gives one consolidated approach <strong>-- Akash Saxena</strong></em></p><p> <strong>Course Highlights</strong> </p> <ul><li>Focus towards the way a C program is written in a real-world project.</li><li>Slightly fast paced and rigorous, yet easily doable.</li><li>Cover as many concepts as possible in a single yet simple program.</li><li>Almost each lecture is clubbed with questions to reinforce basic concepts.</li><li>Constant additions and updates to content</li></ul><p> <strong>Course Objectives</strong> </p> <ul><li>Make the student capable of writing a new C program from scratch on his own.</li><li>Make the student comfortable in dealing with difficult concepts like pointers</li><li>Familarize the student with as many basic features of C as possible.</li><li>Make the student get comfortable referring to the C Programming Language book </li><li>Make the student feel happy and accomplished.</li></ul><p>  \t                                This is an evolving course. Future additions to the course could be based on the what the students want to learn next, apart from more additions to the fundamental concepts.  </p>  <p>  \t                                Learning C is a life-changing experience. After you learn C thoroughly, you can never ever become a bad or mediocre programmer in your career.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong><em>If you don't like the course, there is always the 30-day money-back guarantee.</em></strong><br>  </p>",
