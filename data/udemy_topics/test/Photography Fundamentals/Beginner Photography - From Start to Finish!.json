    "description": "<p>Learning digital photography can be overwhelming! There is an entire world around just waiting to be seen and experienced. Knowing how to use your camera will enable you to take pictures as you see it with your own eyes!</p><p><strong>Learn and Master Your DSLR Camera So You Can Capture the Beautiful World Around You. </strong><br></p><ul><li>Recognize the core of what goes into making a great photo. </li><li>Become confident in taking control of your camera settings.</li><li>Learn different types of blur and how to remove them.</li><li>Find inspiration to take photos you never thought you could take. </li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Understanding Basic Fundamentals is a Major Step in Defining Your Style as a Photographer.</strong><br></p><p>After having taught thousands of people online and in person on how to improve their photography, I have learned the steps needed to rapidly increase your understanding and build upon it. I have taken 2 years of photography training and knowledge and condensed it down into an easy to follow and easy to understand format. </p><p>You will have more confidence in the photos you take by the end of the course as we cover topics such as lighting, exposure modes and  settings for specific environments. We'll even address popular questions about buying new camera gear. And as bonus, I've even got some tips for you when you're working with clients. </p><p><strong>Course Overview </strong></p><p><strong></strong>Throughout this course, there are 48 different lessons covering every thing from lighting to working with clients. At the end of each section you'll find a short quiz. The quizzes are intended to reinforce key principles that you should have learned by watching the videos. </p><p>Photography is a subjective art, but there are core fundamentals of what makes a great photo no matter the creative twist and personal style you apply to it. Understanding these basics will transcend through the work you do making your photos stronger and truly stand out against the sea of photos readily available online. </p><p>While it might be one thing to understand what goes into making a great photo, it's another thing entirely to actually capture the moment we're seeing with our own eyes. A fair amount of this course is dedicated to helping you understand how the camera works, the function of different settings, and when to use them.</p><p>To strengthen your learning, there are various Photo Challenges attached to certain lessons that you can practice with. You're strongly encouraged to take the time to complete these challenges because it's the fastest way to build upon each new concept you will learn in these classes. As you practice with your own camera, things will suddenly start to click and make better sense, leaving you with more confidence and experience.</p><p>This course is for all new photographers with any DSLR camera. Each camera, however, does function and operate slightly different between brands and models. For specific function, turn to your owners manual for exact directions.  <br></p><p>As you complete this course, you will have more knowledge, stronger confidence, and better pictures. You will feel good with the work you are doing as you are finally able to share with others the world as you see it. <br></p><p>Let's get started! </p>",
