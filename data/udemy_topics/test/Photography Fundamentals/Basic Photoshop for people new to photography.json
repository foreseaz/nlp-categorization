For people who secretly don't know how their lovely camera really works. </p><p>But who want to take a few of their good shots of family and holidays and make them amazing.</p><p>We cover the essentials without getting technical. It's not a 17 hour marathon.It's short, clear, step by step without skipping any of the basics. With exercise files you can download and work along with me.</p><p><span></span>I also have printable notes so you can follow along and scribble your own personal notes. I'll be teaching how to open your camera's files in Photoshop - Adjust the contrast and color of your images.</p><p><span></span>You'll be able to easily retouch out spots and blemishes or completely remove objects if you need too. You'll learn how to make basic montage's. As well as how to get your files saved so you can take them down to your local copy shop to be printed.</p><p>Know that I'll be around to help - when you're ready you can send me your work and I'll see if they are any suggestions I can offer.</p><p><span></span>Feel free to have a look through the course description and I look forward to showing you how easy Photoshop really can be. </p><p>- Daniel Walter Scott (Adobe Photoshop Certified Instructor). </p>\n\n\n\n",
