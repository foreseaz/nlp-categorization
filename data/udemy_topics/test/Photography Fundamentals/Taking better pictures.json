The pictures that generate income for photographers. What makes these shots better than yours? Why do picture editors choose these shots? What are you currently missing with yours? What needs to change?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t            Once you understand the secret elements professional pictures have, you will learn how to include these into your own shots. You will learn the techniques through many examples and experience the results immediately - and by taking this course, you should never take a bad picture again!  </p>",
