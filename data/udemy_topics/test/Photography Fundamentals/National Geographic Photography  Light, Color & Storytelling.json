    "description": "<p><strong>The best way to learn the art of photography is by watching a master artist at work.</strong> In Masters of Photography: How to Use Color, Light, and Storytelling in Photography—eight lectures taught by four top National Geographic photographers who represent the gold standard of photography—you’ll gain unprecedented access to true masters, watching and learning from them as they work. </p>\n\n<p>Join Michael Melford, an internationally recognized landscape photographer, for a discussion about diffuse light, sidelight, backlight, and “magic” light, and how to use filters to control the available light. </p>\n\n<p>Annie Griffiths, Executive Director of Ripple Effect Images, demonstrates how the different “personalities” of colors communicate emotions. She’ll provide practical tips on shooting at all times of day, using backgrounds, and creating silhouettes, and she’ll show you how to use light for drama and interest, nature shots, and special event photos. </p>\n\n<p>Learn how to create impact with your photos following the lead of William Albert Allard, photographer and writer, and consider photographing traditional icons in new ways. </p>\n\n<p>Ed Kashi—photojournalist, filmmaker, and educator—takes the lessons on visual storytelling to the next level, sharing insights into capturing daily life, cultures, landscapes, a sense of place, and a cohesive feeling or mood. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond revealing professional secrets, this course provides a toolbox overflowing with techniques you’ll put into practice every time you lift your camera.</p>",
