It is structured with the intention to make you feel knowledgeable, aware and intelligent. It is structured with the mindset that although interior design is vast and commonly used, not many people understand the theory, the principles and the amount of effort it requires.</p><p>There is a reason as to why interior design became a profession of its own. There is a reason why it is worth around billions and billions of pound each and every year. Think about it, you probably have visited an Ikea store, watch shows detailing people design their dream homes, often dream of your own dream home.  probably spend some time in furniture stores and I am certain that you love art. All of this encompasses interior design. It would be a wasteful opportunity not to make the most of this knowledge. Not to understand interior design for yourself, so you can use it when playing with your own space no matter how small.</p><p>The job market for interior design grows everyday. Even more so, you as an individual have the opportunity to create work for yourself. If a friend needed an opinion on wallpaper or preffered art, or to gather an idea of color theory, that's where you can help.</p><p><br></p><p>So care to join me?</p>",
