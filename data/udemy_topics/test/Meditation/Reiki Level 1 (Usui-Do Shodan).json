    "description": "<p>  \tUsui-Do is the original style of Reiki. When Mikao Usui, the founder of Reiki in Japan, first started his 'Method of Personal Perfection' it was focused on developing onself spiritually. His original students called this 'Usui-Do' (way of Usui).  </p><p>***</p><p> <strong><em>\"Wonderful Experience</em></strong><em>. I have loved this course. Carmen is a wonderful lecturer whose enthusiasm shines through. I have learnt so much &amp; cannot wait to see what happens in my life now I open to the gorgeous energies. Thank you so much Carmen xx\" </em>~ Dayle Hill</p><p>***</p>  <p>  \tTraining in Usui-Do, or as otherwise known as Reiki, is a non-religious practice of spiritual and personal development. Usui-Do is the name Mikao Usui's (the Founder) students called this spiritual practice (Way of Usui). When this practice first came to the Western world it travelled to us through Dr. Hayashi's student Hawayo Takata. As Dr. Hayashi was focused mainly on the healing abilities our Western world became more familiar with Reiki as a way of healing others.  </p>  <p>  \tThe original students of Usui knew this as a method to achieve personal perfection. They focused on reciting the five precepts in meditation daily and practiced the energy exercises.  </p>  <p>  \tThey received regular Reiju known as \"Spiritual Blessings\". In our Western version called Reiki we know these as \"attunements\" which were only given to \"attune\" a student to the different levels. In Usui-Do Reiju was given regularly to enhance the student's connection to the Universal Energies. Although there were many health benefits of practicing Usui-Do - these were not focused on.  </p>  <p>  \tWhen learning and practicing Reiki it's important to acknowledge its original form. Interesting to note, is that Usui always first focused healing on the head.  </p>  <p>  \tIt has become well-known that our thoughts create our reality, including our illnesses and dis-ease. Usui was aware of this as he always focused on the head first. When our thoughts are peaceful and joyful our lives improve. This fact is now well known in Positive Psychology. The more positivity (love and joy, etc) we experience in our day-to-day lives the healthier we are including an improved immune system to combat colds and flus, reduced blood pressure, relieve stress and anxiety (and their symptoms), the lessening of headaches and migraines, and so on.  </p>  <p>  \tReiki has now been proven in scientific research as an effective way to help and heal many ailments and diseases. I've included some of the valuable research in this course for your to peruse.  </p>  <p>  \tBut most importantly, you'll be introduced to the traditional techniques of Usui-Do which are powerful energy exercises to boost the overall flow of Universal Energy throughout your body to increase personal change and improve your life.  </p>  <p>  \tThis is a very valuable course that you're sure to love. In this course you'll receive:  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><span>Traditional Techniques &amp; Energy Exercises</span></li>  \t<li><span>Five Precepts</span></li>  \t<li><span>Informational handouts</span></li>  \t<li><span>Reiki Attunement &amp; Reiju MP3 meditation</span></li>  \t<li><span>Your personal Reiju experience.</span></li>  </ul>  <p>  \tAfter this course, you'll be fully certified in Reiki to practice Reiki on yourself and others. Although it is encouraged that you first focus on yourself to improve your thoughts, clear your energies, increase the energy flow throughout your body, and heal past and present issues. When you feel you have a more expansive way of living you will naturally give this healing vibe to others.  </p>  <p>  \tNamaste!  </p>",
