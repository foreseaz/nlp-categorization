There are many different kinds of empathic sensitivity. Some empaths feel other people’s emotions, some feel others’ physical sensations, and some empaths are sensitive to what is happening to animals and even the natural environment.  </p>  <p>  \t         The kind of empath this training addresses is called an <strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Energy Empath</em></strong>. These empaths may experience any or all of the other types of empathic sensing, and in addition, <strong style=\"\">t</strong><strong style=\"\">hey are sensitive to and often absorb subtle energy from the environment and people around them</strong>.  This is often heavy or negative energy, and it leaves the Energy Empath feeling many different kinds of negative symptoms, including confusion, emotional upset, nausea, itching/burning/swelling of the skin, and even asthma-like symptoms.  </p>  <p>  \t         If you want to find out if you are an Energy Empath, complete the free assessment included in Section 1 of the training (PDF version) or online at:  </p>  <p>  \t<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2DPG8GY\" class=\"external-link\" style=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Energy Empath Self-Assessment</a>  </p>  <p>  \t <strong style=\"\">Fortunately, Energy Empaths do not have to continue to suffer.</strong> This video is designed to provide you with the understanding, tools, and techniques to easily and quickly sense, clean and protect your energy body.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">The advantage of the ISEE Energy techniques is that you can do them by yourself, anytime and anywhere!</strong> They involve <strong style=\"\">mental visualization</strong> so you don’t need any special tools or privacy to use them like you would with smudging or sprays.
