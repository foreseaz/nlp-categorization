Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion and complication around this simple practice. This course will make it clear, simple and easy for you to meditate. No spiritual woo-woo topics. Just pure practical exercises to train your mind to be relaxed, focused and creative.</p><p>This is a beginners course that will teach how to meditate properly so you can relieve anxiety &amp; stress and experience more peace and relaxation. And the exercise will take as little as 1-5 minutes per day. </p><p><br>This course will walk you through specifically <em>why, how, when, where and exactly what you need to do to master meditation</em>.</p><p>----------------------</p>",
