    "description": "<p>\r\n\tMy name is Joe Mauriello and I learned about the many wonderful benefits of meditation when I was a very young child. By the time that I was five, my asthma had become life threatening. I spent many, many nights suffering with asthma. Did you know that when you are unable to get enough oxygen that your body will begin to shut down, and possibly destroy parts of the body that you don’t need to live? By the age of six, I had learned this fact by living through it many times. Unless you have ever experienced it, you don’t realize how very important remaining calm is during a serious health problem until you have experienced it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tStress, anxiety, worry, fear, anger, depression and many other negative emotions trigger certain biological responses within the human body. By the time I was seven years old I realized that if I could remain calm during asthma attacks, then the attacks would be shorter and not as devastating. So what is the best way to remain calm when your lungs are becoming so constricted that every breath is a painful struggle? That’s easy, meditation. Fortunately for me, my mother had recently learned about meditation and was able to teach it to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, I quickly realized that when an asthma attack is starting you don’t have a lot of time to meditate. So I studied different techniques, refined the systems and discovered ways to streamline it until I had a meditation technique that is fast, easy and extremely powerful, and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlthough I developed my meditation technique to save my life, I quickly realized that it was improving every aspect of my life. I was\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Calmer</li>\r\n\t<li>More Relaxed</li>\r\n\t<li>Stress Free</li>\r\n\t<li> More Productive</li>\r\n\t<li>Having Greater Creativity</li>\r\n\t<li>Seeing Better Relationships</li>\r\n\t<li>Improving Every Part of Life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis meditation technique is compatible with all religions, and with those who practice no religions. I have taught it to hundreds of people over the years and they all have found that it is easy to use, something that can fit into their busy lives every day and, after a year, they all have reported amazing results. Isn’t it time for you to have a life filled with peace and happiness?\r\n</p>",
