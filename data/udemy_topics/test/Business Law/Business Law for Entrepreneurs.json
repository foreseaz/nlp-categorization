What can they do for me?</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Should I sign that contract? What if I need to back out?</strong></p><p><strong>What exactly is a partnership agreement? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          In this super-simple primer, you'll learn the basics of business structures, agency, and contracts, specially designed for those who are launching or running a new business.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          If you're an entrepreneur who's ready to easily master the basics of business law, corporations, and contracts, this course is for you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<strong>Leverage Your Business to Greater Success by Mastering Legal Principles.</strong>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          I created this course because I hated to see so many smart, focused, entrepreneurial adult students struggle with the basics of business law in my classroom.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          I have practiced, researched, and/or taught law in two countries and yes, it's complicated – but the principals of law are so incredibly powerful, so perfectly developed to turbocharge your business efforts (or sink them, if you don't know the basics) that I set out to teach this in an easy, accessible manner so anyone can master the basics, speak the language, and even enjoy the learning.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          This I firmly believe:  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          If you're smart enough to launch or run a business, or even launch your own professional career, you're more than smart enough to master the fundamentals of business law.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          So I designed this narrated video series for smart, hard-working adults who are brand new to law, and not ready to commit to a complicated course series.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>  \t          Each narrated video includes a quick concept overview, storyline update, learning review, vocabulary lists, questions for thought  -- all this in just 2 to 3-minutes – followed by  a super-simple spot-check quiz to position you for success from the very first lesson.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<p>  \t\t          ·Who should take this course?
