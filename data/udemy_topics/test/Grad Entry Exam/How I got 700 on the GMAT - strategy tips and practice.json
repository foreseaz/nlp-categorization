It tells you how to achieve fast and smart solutions to the GMAT problems and highlights how not to waste your effort while studying and during the test. This is a very practice-oriented course. I have assembled the methods that worked for me, you need to make them your own through exercise and repetition. </p><p>You can benefit from suggestions for free prep resources and tips on how to get the most out of the official prep software through minor hacks. I will also answer all your questions and elaborate on topics that interest you the most from those covered in the course.</p><p>Too many students waste their efforts and study too much without the desired results. I want to end their frustration by showing them what to focus on and how to avoid the GMAT traps.</p>",
