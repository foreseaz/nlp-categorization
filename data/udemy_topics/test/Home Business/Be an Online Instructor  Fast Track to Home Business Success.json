When you complete this course you&#039;ll be ready to start a home business to sell your courses to an online audience of millions of students.  </p>  <p>  \t    If you’re new to online teaching then I strongly encourage you to take this course now. I’m confident that you’ll save many hours of your valuable time by learning what I know. I&#039;ll teach you to work quickly and efficiently, which is a handsome return on the time you spend taking this course. And as folks often say, time is money.  </p>  <p>  \t                            It’s a special kind of course that utilizes much of the skill set associated with traditional classroom instruction, but also another skill set that you need to know about now.  More importantly you need to spring into action and acquire that skill set, not just hear about it.  This is a hands on, modular course that will teach you those skills, not just tell you about them.  </p>  <p>  \t                            I created this course in just three days, or more precisely 72 hours of actual work. If you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work on your own course then enroll now!  I don’t know when you’re reading this but I can tell you that this course will initially be free. It may not stay that way, so if you’re one of the lucky ones who gets it for free then congratulations!  </p>",
