    "description": "<p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Newly Updated 5/27/2015</strong></p><p>This course was recently updated with 23 new lectures adding 2 hours of content explaining how to fill in every Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) field while publishing your content in order to optimize your sales on Amazon. This new content takes the course well beyond simply filling in some fields on a web form by explaining how I publish books to maximize profits. Marketing your book should begin well before you publish it, but how you fill in the KDP fields to define your book&#039;s Amazon product page will determine whether your book blossoms or withers on the vine.</p><p>More content to follow soon.</p><p><strong style=\"\">Want to Become a Published Author Today?</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  Ebook sales represent a $3+ billion dollar yearly industry waiting to be tapped by you.  The Amazon Kindle eReader dominates the reading world accounting for nearly 2/3 of all eBooks sold.  Isn&#039;t it time to get your piece of the pie?  Isn&#039;t it time that you were published?  </p>    <p><strong style=\"\">3 1/2+ Hours of High Quality Online Video Training!</strong></p><p><strong style=\"\">Over 1500 Students Currently Enrolled!!</strong></p><p><strong style=\"\">6 x ***** 5 Star ***** Reviews!!!</strong>  </p>    <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Learn How to Self-publish on Amazon</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course I&#039;ll teach you how to format a novel, novella, or short story using Microsoft Word and then how to publish the output of that process for sale on the Amazon website, the world&#039;s largest bookstore, right alongside the big boys in the industry (King, Grisham, ...).  </p>    <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Clear and Precise</em></strong>   \t<em style=\"\">Brian, thank you for showing ALL the steps to publish thru KDP using WORD.

Brian, self-publishing on Amazon is so easy that anyone can do it without a training video.  Well, that&#039;s true, however <strong style=\"\">some of us</strong> like a little guidance along the way.  I&#039;m ready to provide that guidance via screen captures of me formatting and publishing an eBook on Amazon.  We&#039;ll even spend a chapter outlining how to create a simple book cover using the online KDP interface.  </p>  <p>  \t  In this course you&#039;ll learn to use Word to:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>Format you document for publication</li>  \t<li>Include a title page</li>  \t<li>Add a table of contents</li>  \t<li>Review and save your work</li>  </ul>    <p>  \t<strong style=\"\"><em style=\"\">Excellent course!</em></strong>   \t<em style=\"\">Easy to follow, well explained, step-by-step course on how to format and upload a kindle ebook, together with template.</em>   \t<em style=\"\"> ---Bronwyn Wilson (<strong style=\"\">5 Stars</strong>)</em>  </p>    <p>  \t<strong style=\"\">Be a Self-published Author By the End of the Day</strong>  </p>  <p>  \t  After a few introductory slides, this course is meant to remain open while you jump back and forth between the live screen capture demonstrations and either Microsoft Word or your browser.
