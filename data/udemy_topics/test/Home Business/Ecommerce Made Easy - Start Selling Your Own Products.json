    "description": "<p>It is fairly easy to build a successful business if you have a blueprint. You simply follow the blueprint and in no time you have your own successful business.</p><p>There is a website where people auction off websites. And in order to sell those sites they explain nicely how their business runs and where they get all their stuff.</p><p>It&#039;s obviously not that obvious. You have to know what you are looking for and where to look. The website that I am talking about is Flippa and I can show you how you can use Flippa to find out much more than you are supposed to know - at least based on the taste of the guys who try to sell their web sites.</p><p>Anyhow, I have put together a video course that shows you how to gather all that information and how you can build your own successful ecommerce business.</p><p>It&#039;s easy if you know what works and where to get the products and where to get traffic from and all that.</p><p>In my new video course I take you by the hand and show you how you can build an ecommerce business using Flippa to gather all the secret intelligence that is vital if you want to be successful.</p><p>In this video course you are going to learn:</p><p>- how and where to source products</p><p>- how to build an ecommerce site </p><p>- how to handle trademark issues</p><p>- how to come up with snappy names for your business and your products</p><p>Another video sows you how to build a business that makes over $5,000 a month profit and requires less than 20 hours of work per week and you don&#039;t have to invest much to get it started.</p><p>You can build such an ecommerce business for yourself or you can</p><p>start it and flip for quick profits. </p><p>These lectures are going to be added shortly:</p><p>- where and how to advertise</p><p>- more examples of niches and products</p><p></p>",
