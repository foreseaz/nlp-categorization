This is the follow up course to How I made $100k my first year selling on Ebay.</em></strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Special Promo Price THIS MONTH only! The price will increase by $10 on July 1st 2016!</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No long sales letter here, this course is FOR YOU if you are a student of my 1st course and you are ready to scale your business and take it to the next level by outsourcing! I will walk you through the whole process and even help train your V.A. (Employee) for you too!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you don't think you or your business is worth the investment, then simple; don't make the investment and don't take the course. Thousands of students have messaged me that paid a promo price on the first course say that after they completed it they would have gladly paid full price for it and even feel bad paying a discounted price because of the VALUE. This is a private course for the BEST students from my first course. Students of this course will have my full undivided extra attention :)</p>",
