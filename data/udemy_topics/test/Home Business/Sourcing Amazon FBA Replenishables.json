    "description": "<p>This course is designed to help teach you techniques that will help you find products that you can source regularly and make you a steady income on Amazon FBA.  The course consists of 29 videos that average around 10 minutes each.  These videos are live screen shares of the exact processes I use to source products on a daily basis.  </p><p>The videos are almost all based on sourcing from your computer, even though we may actually be getting  product from retail stores.  While the course does have some online arbitrage, it is generally using techniques that many sellers are not aware of. I won't be telling you to check Keepa 7 times a day or subscribe to a paid list.</p><p>By using the screen share method of teaching, it is like we are sitting down and working one on one through the different techniques.  My goal is to teach you how a full time FBA seller is thinking when they have to find products.  </p><p>I have purposely left the normal \" beginner\" stuff out of the course as much as possible.  I don't believe that it adds much value to the audience that I am trying to reach, so if you are wanting to learn how to list a product or open an Amazon account, this may not be the course for you.</p><p>You will learn how to think out of the box about sourcing and learn that there is better ways than scanning every item in a stores aisle.</p><p>I don't expect you to do every single technique presented here, but by the time you have completed the course, you should expect to be able to build a list of replenishable items that you can count on for steady income.</p><p><br></p>",
