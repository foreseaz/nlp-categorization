Just like every business, there's process and system to follow. This is very real, and if done correctly, it can help you generate a good passive income - <em>even while you sleep!</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                         I've been on Amazon Kindle since 2011, making thousands of dollars selling ebooks - some of which became bestsellers! The e-book publishing business is NOT dead! It's not even close. It will stay around for quite some time!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>\"E-reading is certainly on the rise. The Pew Research Center reports that, as recently as 2010, hardly anyone in the US had an e-reader or tablet. Now half do. The proportion of the population who have read an ebook in the past year rose from 17 per cent in 2011 to 28 per cent just three years later. In the UK, figures from Nielsen, which monitors book sales, showed that one in four consumer titles bought in 2013 was an ebook, up from one in five a year earlier.\" - </em>The Financial Times Limited 2014  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                                               This course is about making money online with e-book publishing, especially with Amazon Kindle and <strong><em>other publishing platforms</em></strong>! The course has close to 50 video lectures, interactive quizzes, and PDF guides, specifically designed to \"hold your hand\" throughout the program so that you can get the success you <em>deserve</em>!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                         If you are looking for ways to generate some passive income and turn your knowledge into cash, you've come to the right place!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                  _____________________________________________________________  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>Excellent Course</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t<em>\"The training course is excellent.

So we <strong>are not</strong> just going to focus on Kindle Publishing, but on Ebook Publishing as a business.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                   Creating and publishing e-books is easy, but also this translates to a lot of competition - since a lot of people have already \"awaken\" to this opportunity. However, what I am about to show you in this course will help you stand out from the competitors. In fact, the competition will move you forward and help you progress in your e-book publishing journey - I'll show you how! It's very non-intuitive, because a lot of people do not look at it in this way.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                           Here's what you'll get after you complete the course:  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>  \t<li>At the end of this course, you'll be able to do an e-book in just 2 days and within 5 days (after the book is published), you'll start getting sales. </li>  \t<li>You'll become a master at outsourcing and NEVER would want to do an e-book yourself - especially if you do not want to do the writing or designing yourself</li>  \t<li>You'll be able to create effective marketing titles and designs to make people BUY</li>  \t<li>You'll make money even while you sleep!</li>  \t<li>You'll \"convert\" what you know into cash!</li>  \t<li>There's no limit about how many e-books you can create or sell, so the limit is virtually the sky. You set your own limits, and this course will help you reach your profits potential.</li>  \t<li>And much more...</li>  </ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                                 Moreover, if you want to earn extra cash to finance other projects, this e-book business will be of a good use to you. That's why you want to consider e-book publishing as a business model and another reason why you should take this course!  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                               In about 2-3 days, it's pretty straight forward and you'll be armed with the knowledge most publishers would never know. So if you take action on what's suggested in this course, it has the potential to change your life - in a positive and more profitable way.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>  \t                                                                                                               No more frustrations!
