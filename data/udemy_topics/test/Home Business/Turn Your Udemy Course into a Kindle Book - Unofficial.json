Interested to get started?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      In this course I will show you everything you need <strong style=\"\">to publish your book in the next 3 days</strong>. That's right! 3 days! Why? Because I've published my book in 3 days.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      However, because we are converting the course into a book, I assume you already have your content ready. If you don't you will get also some idea on how to get started.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t      This is again a screen record course, which means you will see everything I do on my screen. So, let's get started. <strong style=\"\">Hit the 'Start Learning Now' button </strong>and I will see you on the other side!  </p>",
