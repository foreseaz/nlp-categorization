I've likely done it.</p><p>I've had some big successes, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Building two 6-figure/year health businesses selling products on Amazon.</strong></li><li><strong>One 7-figure per year software business.</strong></li><li><strong>3 successful apps, two in the health market, one in the gaming market.</strong></li></ul> <p>I even once bought a one word dictionary .com domain name for $32,000 in cash and sold it 15 days later for $125,000 (making almost $100K in profit for doing NO work whatsoever).</p><p>Other good things have happened too.</p><p>So yes, some of my ventures have worked out well. </p><p><em>The journey, however, has not always been easy...</em></p><p>I've also had my fair share of disasters, some of which have been truly COLOSSAL.</p><p><em>For instance:</em></p><p>I wasted 2 years of my life (along with $150K cash) on a project that fell at the FINAL hurdle, when just before launching, Apple brought out an exact version of the app I was building, available for free and as default on iOS 7. </p><p><em>and:</em></p><p>A few years back, I bought a one word .com finance related domain name for $64,000, invested an additional $60K in development and SEO, spent 18 months getting onto the first page of Google US for the term 'credit cards', did so successfully, started making around $1000 in commissions per day...</p><p><strong>...and then BAM! </strong>Google's Penguin update hit the site literally 7 days after I got there, obliterating the rankings and causing the business to die overnight. </p><p>Ouch... (x 2)</p><p>I've had other disasters too, but the above are particularly depressing examples!</p><p>The point of me telling you all this is that due to the successes I've had, along with the (frankly unwanted) opportunities to learn from my failures, I have been able to develop a complete understanding of the following when it comes to making money online:</p><p><strong> What NEVER works</strong></p><p><strong> What SOMETIMES works</strong></p><p><strong> What ALWAYS works</strong> </p><p>...And most importantly, which online business types and markets are realistic to compete in, but are still scalable into 6, 7 or even 8 figure operations that would continue to be manageable working from home.</p><p><strong>One of those business types is SELLING ON AMAZON.</strong></p><p>...and I'm here to help you take selling on Amazon into a WHOLE New Dimension.</p><p>There are many courses out there on building Amazon businesses... some cheap, some hugely expensive, but <strong>this is different</strong>.</p><p>My Amazon MasterPlan contains ALL the information you need.</p><p>But... why should it matter to you?</p><p><em>Well, let me ask...</em></p><ul><li>Are you already selling on Amazon?</li><li><span></span>or looking for a way to make a great living online?</li><li>or do you want to add a bow to an existing online business?</li><li>Maybe you have an eCommerce or dropshipping website?</li></ul><strong>If any of the above apply, my Amazon Masterplan MATTERS.</strong><p>Not only does it consist of EVERYTHING you need to know about how to make money selling physical products on Amazon...</p><p>...it shows you how to capitalize on the exposure that Amazon can bring, enabling you to expand and build out into additional platforms quickly,</p><p>creating high value (and if you wish, sellable) brands, as well as multiple income streams ...in a very short period of time.</p><p>And one thing I must add...</p><p><strong><em>The great thing about Amazon is this:</em></strong></p><p><strong>The Traffic and Buyers Are ALREADY There.</strong></p><p>You don't need to grind to get them...</p><p>You simply need to get in front of them.</p><p>In other words...</p><p><em><strong>X</strong> - You don't need to do traditional SEO</em></p><p><em><strong>X</strong> - You don't need to do link building</em></p><p><em><strong>X </strong>- You don't need to pay sky high costs for Google ads</em></p><p>...and you don't need that whole list of other time consuming and frustrating stuff either.</p><p>There is, however, one important thing to remember....and this is relevant no matter what type of business you are in or want to pursue...</p><p><strong>The success (or failure) of any business is usually down to one thing: EXECUTION</strong></p><p>Take it from me...Good ideas and effort are simply NOT enough.</p><p>In my view most people fail to make a living online, not because of lack of effort, but because they don't know how to execute their plan properly. (which mostly tends to be unstructured, if there is a plan at all).</p><p>And even those who have done it all before and know how to run and scale a business, STILL need a structured plan in place in order for their execution to be efficient, seamless and successful.</p><p>And that is exactly what this course is...</p><p><strong>It is the private Masterplan originally for MY use, *remastered* for YOUR use...</strong></p><p><strong>...with NOTHING left out.</strong></p><p>It really is everything you need to know about making money on Amazon and beyond, condensed into detailed manuals and videos with, zero-fluff, direct to the point step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow.</p><p>However, you genuinely have to be prepared...</p><p>It is BRUTALLY comprehensive and not for the faint hearted. </p><p>It is a full-on A â€“ Z, militarily precise course.</p><p><strong>No waffle. No filler. No BS.</strong></p><p>Even if you have no experience selling on Amazon, or indeed any experience doing anything at all online, that is A-ok.</p><p>...Because this course is so step-by-step and uber-focused, all you need to have is the ability to follow very clear instructions.</p><p><strong>Here are 7 reasons why you should download this course today:</strong> </p><p><strong>1. </strong>You will get exclusive access to a complete PROVEN roadmap featuring fine-tuned instructions revealing how to make money selling physical products on Amazon with nothing left out.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Every stage of selling on Amazon is covered... from product and niche research, marketing and promotion, supplier search and inventory ordering, packaging, premium branding, list building, external traffic sources and much more.</p><p><span></span><strong>3.</strong> If you already sell on Amazon, you can use this information to boost your rankings, traffic &amp; sales overnight and expand into additional platforms to increase brand exposure and revenue.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>If you have an ecommerce or dropshipping website, my Masterplan will show you how to sell on Amazon for an easy increase in traffic and profits.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> This is a complete package and all the training is included in the core Masterplan course.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>I include helpful spreadsheets, templates and will add additional training modules that will help you get more traffic, save more time and make more money.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>You will get access to me if you have questions.
