The management of it takes about 1 hour a month so no sitting looking at trading screens all day long or anything and still getting fantastic returns which can be between 1%-3% a month on capital employed achieved by current students (required disclaimer: this may not be the case for you).  This is what the big institutions do and try to keep from you.  </p>",
