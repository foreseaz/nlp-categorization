For most people I know, it would be priceless.</p>\n\n<p>Just the possibility of having this kind of success would be worth the investment.  I have personally invested thousands of dollars and four years of my life learning what I share in this course about creating products to sell online. </p>\n\n<p>I only wish that someone had taken all of this valuable information and shared it with me when I was starting out. I wish I would have been able to buy this knowledge and experience for such a low price. And I know that you’ll be glad you made the investment in yourself once you have your first success after taking this course.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s my question: What do you have for sale online right now?
