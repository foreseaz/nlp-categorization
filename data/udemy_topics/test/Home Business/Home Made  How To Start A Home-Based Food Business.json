    "description": "<p>\r\n\t   Until recently, if you wanted to turn your passion for cooking or baking into a business you had to operate out of a commercial kitchen which could be a timely and expensive proposition.  Thanks to more and more states in the US adopting Cottage Food Laws in the past few years, it&#039;s now possible for food entrepreneurs to start and run food businesses from their homes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t   This course is broken up into 23 easy-to-digest lectures that cover everything from Cottage Food Law specifics to other aspects of business licensing you may need.  From there the course moves on to helping you create a business plan and business strategy that will make sure your business is moving forward in the right direction.\r\n</p>",
