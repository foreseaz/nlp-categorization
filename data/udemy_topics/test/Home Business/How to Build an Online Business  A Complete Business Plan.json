ALL INSTRUCTIONS ARE FULLY DETAILED AND STEP-BY-STEP SO ANYONE CAN FOLLOW THEM EASILY.  </p>  <p>  \t                       Online passive income is the ultimate dream. Making money while you sleep. Everybody wants it.  </p>  <p>  \t                       But is it really possible?  </p>  <p>  \t                       The short answer is \"yes.\"  </p>  <p>  \t                       The longer answer is \"yes, but it isn't easy to accomplish.\"  </p>  <p>  \t                       If it was, wouldn't everyone be doing it?  </p>  <p>  \t                       In my course, I give you a step-by-step plan on how to develop a passive income website portfolio and show you how making money online actually works.  </p>  <p>  \t                       The specific plan I teach is designed to make you $5,000 per month in passive income earnings, based on 10 websites, with each website having a targeted earnings level of at least $500 each. Once you understand the process though, you can decide to build 20 of these websites, or 100! When you stop is up to you (and yes, there are people making tens of thousands of dollars per month on the Internet based on these concepts - they just love the work and don't ever stop building new websites or expanding their current ones!).  </p>  <p>  \t                       What's great about the business plan that I teach you is not only the income level you will accomplish if you follow through, but all that you will learn in the process. The first lesson you are taught is how to build a website or blog using WordPress on your own domain (without having to learn how to code). The skills you learn in this course will enable you to build all kinds of online businesses and open the door for all kinds of entrepreneurial projects you may have.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Note</strong>: When I say we will be creating a website using WordPress, I don't mean creating one through the WordPress website. Websites created through the WordPress website are severely limited in what you can do with them and offer very little flexibility overall. The method I teach enables you to create truly professional websites by installing the WordPress software and you won't be limited in any way.  </p>  <p>  \t                       Not only that, you will be able to evaluate business ideas much more intelligently once you've gone through this whole process. You will understand the fundamentals of keyword research &amp; analysis, traffic &amp; lead generation, social &amp; affiliate marketing, monetization &amp; conversion testing, and traffic analysis. These skills will help you immensely in ANY business you ever decide to start (online or not, passive or not).  </p>  <p>  \t                       Generating an online passive income won't happen overnight and takes a lot of hard work, but going through the process is completely worth it and having an exact plan of action is the ONLY way to ensure success.  </p>  <p>  \t                       Let me put it this way: if you were offered no pay for six months for 40+ hours of work per week, but after those six months, you got $5,000+ per month for the rest of your life, would that be worth it to you?  </p>  <p>  \t                       If that idea isn't unbelievably exciting to you, then this isn't the business for you.  </p>  <p>  \t                       This isn't a get rich quick scheme. This is a business. Except with this business, instead of trading your time for money (like most jobs), you are investing your time. You work hard now and continue to reap the benefits indefinitely. Building an online business takes a lot of work and a lot of patience, but the rewards can be amazing.  </p>  <p>  \t                     That's the kind of business I teach you in this course.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>NOTE</strong>: Throughout my course you will be referred to video lessons. While everything in video lessons are as up to date as possible (I frequently update the video lessons), the place to check for the most up-to-date information is in the <em>video descriptions</em> (on the same page you watch the videos). This can be the video descriptions on the pages of the LIONS CLUB website, or the video description of the Udemy or YouTube pages. Be sure to read the video descriptions of each video <em>before </em>watching the video itself.  </p>",
