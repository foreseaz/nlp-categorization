Entrepreneurs usually use independent contractors for <strong>specialized, short-term work</strong> and it’s a great way to try out a worker before committing to a longer term. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this course, I will clearly explain how to <strong>legally hire independent contractors and freelancers for your business</strong> and explain and even provide the <strong>contracts</strong> and <strong>forms </strong>you need in hiring freelancers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WHY DO I NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save considerable amount of money by classifying a worker as an independent contractor rather than an employee. However, the Department of Labor and the IRS target businesses that use independent contractors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some associated risks of working with independent contractors. Employer misclassification of employees as independent contractors, either inadvertently or to avoid taxation and regulation, is widespread but <em>very risky</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many states, <strong>you can face <em>heavy violations</em> for misclassifying employees as independent contractors</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By enrolling in this course, <strong>you can get all of your questions answered by a business lawyer.</strong><strong></strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don’t take the risk of hiring or maintaining independent contractors until you’ve taken this course.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>★ Student review by Joe Mob, <strong>“Efficient and qualitative information - easy to grasp content and detailed analysis of application of concept to hire independent contractor... great teacher</strong><strong>\"</strong><br></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>★ Student review by Riv Rah, <strong>“What a great course!
