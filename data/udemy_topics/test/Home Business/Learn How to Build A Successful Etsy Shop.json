    "description": "<p>  \tPerhaps you thought about creating an Etsy shop or have one already as a home based business. Either way it takes more than just creating a shop, adding a product or two, and then wait for the sales to pour in. In this definitive course on Etsy you will learn everything from how to choose the proper name for your online shop all the way to the most efficient way to ship your products from home without having to leave.  </p>  <p>  \tIf you happen to be crafty, artistic, a great baker, or like to build things with your own bare hands you can sell your creations in your very own online shop. Etsy has made it possible for creative people to run their own home based business based on their love and passion for arts, crafts, and baked goods. They also let you sell antique and vintage items as well. The best part is that they will handle all transactions saving you from the hassle.  </p>  <p>  \tMy name is Mike M Burke and I run a very successful Etsy shop. My products are well loved by many from all around the world and now I am going to teach you everything I learned from A to Z! No stone will be left unturned as we will break down each aspect and detail of running an Etsy shop.  </p>  <p>  \tWe will go through the registration process, naming your shop, creating your products, processing orders, protecting your business, shipping, legal issues, store policies, and all the way to growing your business for more revenue. I'll teach you an amazing tip about sharing your own personal story that can dramatically increase your sales. You will also learn tips for marketing and advertising so that your products and shop can be found by the search engines and other websites.  </p>  <p>  \tMy approach to teaching is through video in a one to one format. When needed I will also show you live examples from the Etsy website. Each lecture covers just one topic full of informative details as well as my own personal stories and experiences related to my own home based business and my Etsy shop. I have nearly 25 years of experience in front of and behind the camera. I speak clearly with passion and energy. The videos are well lit with broadcast quality sound. Average running time is 5 minutes however there are 10 to 20 minute long videos as well. There are 41 video lectures and you can realistically complete multiple lectures in one sitting. You will find a few printable documents included to help serve as a guide as you take this course and build your Etsy shop. Finally, you will find that at the end of certain sections there will be a quiz. These quizzes are designed to test you on the most important information from each section and lecture.  </p>  <p>  \tEtsy can change your life and give you an opportunity to be free from any boss for the rest of life. By the time you finish the last lecture in this course you will be ready to build your very own Etsy shop with ease or if you currently have a shop you will learn some new things you didn't know to help increase your revenue. Everything you need to learn how to create a successful Etsy shop as your very own home based business is here. You don't just dream big; you make those dreams a reality!  </p>",
