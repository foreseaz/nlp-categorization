    "description": "<p>  \t<span>Set in a series of stories, the lessons place you in everyday situations and daily activities of a family. Every story consists of ten lessons, each expanding on the previous all while having a tutor clarify grammar and idioms as needed. The whole learning process focuses on the family membersâ€™ casual conversations in their daily lives which progressively become more and more complex. This learning experience flows very naturally and it is meant to make you feel like you are a part of the story actively participating with the family, rather than simply studying words and phrases.</span>  </p>  <p>  \tThe BASIC program (Lessons A-J) covers the essential material needed when traveling. Level 1 (Lessons 1-100) is where complex stories involving the entire family takes place.  </p>",
