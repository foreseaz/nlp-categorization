    "description": "<p>This course features a number of different perspectives on the future of accelerated learning, education and the technologies that enable them.</p><p>You'll learn the top strategies for accelerated learning from a number of instructors, as well as what the future hold for accelerated learning.</p><p>As decades have rolled by, not much has truly changed in the world of accelerated learning. Speed reading has been around for decades, if not centuries. </p><p>Memorization techniques go back thousands of years. Note taking is as old as the written word. And new techniques, like mind mapping, are not the one size fits all solution they are often presented as being.</p><p>One of the major weaknesses in accelerated learning is the problem of organization. </p><p>And it's a problem at every stage.</p><p>Finding information through research is a major obstacle because there is no single place to find neatly organized information. In fact, a large part of learning is just finding the materials you need so that you can get started learning.</p><p>Speed reading evolved out of the need to speed through the sometimes serious amount of fluff contained in educational materials. </p><p>Books sell better, even educational books, when they focus more on entertaining stories than on educational content. </p><p>The real golden nuggets are often buried in mountains of uninformative junk. And there isn't any easy way of separating them.</p><p>Note taking is another major issue. How do you organize ideas? How do you write down on paper the complex relationships that exist between the ideas you are trying to summarize and understand? </p><p>These relationships are usually left as implicit messages that you have to figure out on your own. But they don't have to be.</p><p>Then there is the problem of memorization...or really, storage. How do you store information, either in your head, in your computer, in your file cabinet....so that you can get to it quickly when you need it? </p><p>What's the best way to set up your learning projects so you don't waste time reading the same things twice because you couldn't find your old research or notes?</p><p>Many advancements have been made in areas outside of accelerated learning that have applications for learning faster and more efficiently. Many of them are presented here for the first time.</p><p>If you're looking for some truly fresh ideas in the accelerated learning space, you've found the right course.</p><p>See you in the course,</p><p>Timothy</p><p><br></p>",
