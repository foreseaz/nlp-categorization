    "description": "<p><strong>Student Success Testimonials and Reviews:<br></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Studying how to learn and how to love learning</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"How to Become a Super Learning Machine\" is an excellent course that focuses on the practical basics of how to learn. The course teaches students about the right attitude to take when learning, the best way to absorb knowledge and how to set goals and achieve them. Thanks to my experience as a teacher, I went into the course understanding most of the concepts that Joe Parys covers. However, thanks to Joe's progressive and hybrid attitude towards learning I was able to take away some new things that have already helped me in my studies. First, Joe covers the importance of surrounding yourself with positive influence. He talks about reasons to stay away from the news. I have always stayed away from the news, but I never knew the reason. He briefly touches on this subject. The news is a source of negativity. I think that I would want to add that he did not say anything bad from gaining knowledge from reputable media like documentaries and lectures. Documentaries are a great way to open yourself to new concepts and start exploring topics of interest. Second, Joe talks about the use of audio books. He talked about how it can be a time saver and how it can supplement learning. Until taking this course, I had shunned audio books as a lazy way out of reading. However, after hearing the arguments for audio books and the reasons why it would benefit me, I immediately became a member of an audio book club. I have a 30-minute commute to work. By using this time to listen to audio books instead of listening to music, I have been able to complete some great books that help me at my job. Audiobooks during a commute are an efficient use of time and energy. The name of the course is a little misleading, but the content and subject matter of the course is top notch.\" -Dodzi D.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Learning Course</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I Purchased this course I was excited about it. After taking it I am even more excited! This course exceeded all of my expectations. The videos were fun, engaging, and I actually learned a lot about how to learn instead of what to learn. The concepts in this course were fascinating and the participation by the instructor is well with the price of enrolling. I can see why this instructor has lots of students in this course... Ton of value.\" -Willie</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Excellent and motivational!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really love this course because it is spot on everything I have been doing for many years. I really encourages me on where I am at and where I want to go next. Thank you Joe for making this course! Once I watched the first video I wanted to keep watching. I am two thirds through already. I really loved the quizes and questions. I'd like more of those because it really made me remember how much I love figuring these things out. For anyone who wants to be encouraged and get great advice I would take this course in a heart beat. Joe is not boring and I really like that he does all sorts of videos and not just inside a closed room. Great course that I would recommend to anyone.\" -Jamie GAMES</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Really got me thinking</strong></p>\n\n<p>I love the mindset this course puts you in. It really makes me think about all of the times I had a poor mindset and attitude towards learning. Very eye opening lectures. I was impressed with the speaker and his ability to deliver learning in a fun and engaging way. I also really enjoyed the background of the videos and the structure of the course. Kept me moving and improving. I have been very impressed\" -Lori T.</p>\n\n<p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>⇉ Join 100,000+ successful students who have already enrolled in my Udemy courses!</strong><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>⇉ With Over 2500+ Five Star Reviews my students are getting real results!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>⇉ This course is MASSIVE! </strong>You receive more than <strong>55+ lectures </strong>and <strong>4+ hours</strong> of content</p>\n\n<p><strong>⇉</strong><strong> Watch the promo video to see how to become a SuperLearning Machine and discover your genius! </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong>In this course you will learn a unique process of learning packed with neuroscience and self development strategies.
