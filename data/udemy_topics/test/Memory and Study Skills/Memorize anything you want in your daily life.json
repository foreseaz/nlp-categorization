So I started to study the subject in an early stage, and I attended many courses and read a lot of books, and I improved ideas that existed before, then I applied them first in my studying, where the results were amazing, my school mates study a month before the test and it takes me only 3 days to study for subjects that needs memorizing. After I graduated, <strong>I applied these techniques in my daily life; in my lectures, meetings with non-profit organizations and in summarizing books that I read. It is a technique that can be lived by, and it is easy, even for children, to learn. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You are going to learn in this material how to memorize at least 20 information when you hear them for the first time</strong>. Wow, it is going to be amazing!! Definitely, with our exaggeration, you will memorize them respectively and you will be able to recall information easily. As you will learn how to develop your list of information in case it is increased up to 100 items and perhaps more.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As we are going to learn by <strong>using real examples that guide how to use this technique in our daily life</strong>, and how it helped me in arranging my time and making it more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Without any doubt you <strong>will improve your imagination and creativity dramatically</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
