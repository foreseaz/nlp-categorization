And I am finding memory palaces that will be wonderful. My house wasn't very good but my job a supercenter of a company that is bigger than some small countries is amazing. At the service area I have thought of over 26 subpalaces.....All in all I think this course is not only going to help me memorize places, but ideas as well. I may even be able to write a novel with this system... If that happens it would be priceless….\" </p><p>- Amanda Humes </p><p>★★★★★ \"I have read a few books on memory training, and what I liked about Anthony Metivier's course here is that he has studied a number of the classic memory systems and synthesized a modern approach. He give good examples and his ideas of using Excel spreadsheets to help assist in organizing the memorization process is very helpful. Of course, as with any activity, you only get out of it what you put into it, but Anthony is so enthusiastic and persuasive that I felt inspired to learn to stick to a daily study routine and indeed learn memorize vocab.\" </p><p>- Chris Guthrey </p><p>★★★★★ \"It is amazing how many spanish words I am learning with ease after going through this course. After sharing with family friends the number of words I am memorizing every day, the first response is generally unbelief. Though I have a ways to go, when we are out in the Latino community, my friends and family are asking me for assistance. I actually wake up each morning excited about picking up and memorizing new words from a Spanish Dictionary! Who gets excited about going through a dictionary? Anthony you are my hero!!!\" </p><p>- James Lewis </p><p>★★★★★ \"With your incredible help, I've been able to memorize the Greek alphabet (words and symbols) front words and backwards in about 3 or 4 total hours of work. I was very worried as I tackled this project, but your techniques were so very helpful.\" </p><p>- Kevin Wax </p><p>★★★★★ \"I have being using this method for learning German for the last while. I read books written by Harry Lorayne, Joshua Foer, Kevin Trudeau etc. I could not get it working. Since I came across this method all missing pieces came together. I am able to memorize around 300-400 words per month. I am very sorry that I have not used mnemonics techniques before. The concept is simple but method is only hard to begin with. I guaranty, if you persist for one month it would hugely pay off. Great method!!!\" </p><p>- D. Stojanovic </p><p>★★★★★ \"It works! A fun and powerful way to remember. Recalling stuff with this method is often magical. The more you use it the more confidence you have in your own ability and the less stress you feel.\" </p><p>- Sean Cunningham </p><p>★★★★★ \"Difficult to believe BUT Easy to do. I memorised my first pack of shuffled cards in less than a week, I did not believe that it would be as easy as it was. I have almost finished my 26 memory palaces. The task of creating the memory palaces and the memorisation process in general has a great positive effect on how you feel.\" </p><p>- Kevin McG </p><p>★★★★★ \"I have completed several memory courses and have had varying degrees of success. However, Anthony gives some detailed advice and training tips, that have made memorization, languages in particular, a lot clearer to me. For myself, he has filled in the blanks so to speak and he has provided some solid information and tools, that have allowed me to take my language studies to a much higher level. Not to mention the fact, that I am now able to expedite the whole process.\" </p><p>- Mike Newton </p><p>★★★★★ \"I've been pretty disappointed with most \"self-help\" materials, as they usually end up giving you nothing more than anecdotes that would only work if you somehow ended up in the EXACT situation as the person in their story. This course is different--you get specific principles that can be applied anywhere and any time. The course is well-presented and interesting.\" </p><p>- Michael Gerity </p><p>★★★★★ \"This method is really good. But its author is really there. I mean that he is answering once and over your questions. Before 24h he advise you and guide you to achieve your aim. And there are extras within that you find out day by day. I am very satisfied and just beginning with it.\" </p><p>- Josep Carrion </p><p>★★★★ \"I'm a linguist in the military who was required to learn a very difficult Middle Eastern language within one year. They sent me to specialized training, where native speakers provided an \"immersion\"-like environment and threw vocabulary lists at us every day for a 10 months. We were then expected to pass a rigorous evaluation in order to pass the training. If only I had had this course during those agonizing months, I would have not only passed with flying colors, but finished ahead of schedule! I'm now confident to attempt even more languages, as well as further improve and develop my current language.\" </p><p>- Jacqueline Wright </p><p>★★★★★ \"Nicely organized and gives multiple strategies for memorizing names and facts . No grandious, claims just solid information.\" </p><p>- Kathleen Byrne</p>",
