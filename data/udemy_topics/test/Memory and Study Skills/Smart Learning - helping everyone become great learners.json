    "description": "<p><em><strong>How can we best encourage effective learning?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>If we enjoy learning, we are 8/10ths of the way to becoming good learners and great students. However If we don't or didn't enjoy ‘school’, or college and learning is seen as a 'chore', then we'll all struggle. If it is us doing the ‘teaching’ and the ‘students’ are our own children for example, then unless they have our understanding, our unconditional love and our continuing support we can actually sabotage their best efforts (as this course demonstrates).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>The natural human state is to be curious</em> about things and when we are young and innocent we all move toward things that grab our curiosity. However, we'll freeze or move away from things that make us anxious. Therefore, the best thing we can do as parents is to <em><strong>remove anxiety from a child's learning environment.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So as teachers, there are things we can do to help children (and adults) love learning, and there are also things we can do (albeit unwittingly through a lack of knowledge and understanding) that can hinder or stop learning in its tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Those of us who are parents, we need to stop measuring and comparing our children to others</strong> (I know it's hard!). Remember that we are all unique and we all develop at different rates. All children have growth spurts and they also have brain spurts. You would not judge a child's intellectual capability based on how tall they are, or how fast they are growing. So why do we insist on, or be complicit in, comparing or 'grading' our child's ability whilst they are still developing?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let us not forget that Einstein was a late talker, a slow learner and did very poorly at school. </strong>Many highly successful people received poor reports at school. So whatever your age, your performance at school is not a good predictor about how successful you can be. So let's take the pressure off schoolchildren and late-learners and focus on what we do well and let's stop doing the things that hinder natural learning progress.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This short course will give you some simple strategies and a better understanding of how to help yourself, your child or other adults become great learners</strong>. The course currently has one main section and this section is all about understanding what is likely to help and what is likely to hinder learning (by looking at how the brain works for example). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the Summer/Autumn of 2016, a new section 3 will be added to the course which will outline some of the more practical things you can do to reinforce what you have learnt from the first section of the course. It will also include relevant insights from educators like Carol Dweck, Reuven Feuerstein, and Alfie Kohn. By enrolling on the course now, you ensure that you'll get the third section of the course without additional cost</p>",
