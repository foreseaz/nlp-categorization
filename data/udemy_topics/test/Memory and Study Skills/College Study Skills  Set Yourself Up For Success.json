This course starts off with helping you to own and take charge of your education, so that you can get the most out of each and every course you take.  </p>  <p>  \t       Post-secondary education is often an overwhelming experience, as students face an avalanche of homework. Students of this course will learn how to set up a master plan at the beginning of each semester so that every assignment gets done on time and with excellence.  </p>  <p>  \t       Grade school does not always prepare students with the right skills necessary for university or college. 7 essential skills will be covered which will equip students to excel in their studies.  </p>  <p>  \t       There are many tools available for students that can greatly aid them in their study, classwork, reading, notes, and productivity. <em style=\"\">The Right Tools</em> section will highlight these for students.  </p>  <p>  \t       Reading and Writing will take on new life for post-secondary students. This course will teach you how to be a better reader as well as help you to properly tackle major written assignments.  </p>  <p>  \t       Often the biggest stumbling blocks for students is themselves. Whether it be their laptop or their smartphone, students distract themselves too much. This course will provide some tips and tricks to stay in the productive zone when studying.  </p>  <p>  \t       At the end of this course, students will better understand what is in store for them at college or university, and will be equipped to create a master plan for tackling their homework, dominating assignments, and getting the most out of their readings and classes.  </p>  <p>  \t   FULL, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, REFUND IF YOU AREN&#039;T SATISFIED :-)  </p>",
