    "description": "<p>In this 6 hour program you will learn how you can overcome your fear of public speaking and show the kind of impressive confidence that motivates people to take action when you speak.</p><p>We know from personal experience that not everyone is a naturally confident public speaker.  On the way to becoming a premier provider of successful communication solutions, our trainers have had to overcome their own fear of public speaking.  This program has every tool and strategy they’ve learned from years of experience, and makes it possible for you to avoid the fear and anxiety associated with public speaking without having to figure out how to do it yourself.<br></p><p>Don't just take our word for it, here's what others have to say:</p><p>\"I conquered my fear in my last presentation.  I was able to give my presentation effectively in front of a crowd without the security of a podium or table. To spectators, I looked and sounded confident. My body did not betray me with shakes or stutters, which is really all I was going for. I was almost surprised how easy it was once I got into it. Even better, now that I have done it once, I feel much more confident about doing it again. Having concrete evidence that I can get up there and not fall apart feels good. And my guess is that with these types of things, you build a momentum. Much like how you can spiral out of control then crash and burn, you can have a positive feedback loop. Now that I am better at public speaking, I feel more confident, which makes me better again and become even more confident.\"</p><p>Payvand Moaddel - Quality Assurance</p><p>\"I have found that slowing down and concentrating on what I’m doing with my hands, my voice, and whether my feet are pointed out does a good job of calming me and distracting me from any presentations jitters. As a result, I’m a more confident presenter.\"<br></p><p>Geoffrey Blanding - Project Manager</p>",
