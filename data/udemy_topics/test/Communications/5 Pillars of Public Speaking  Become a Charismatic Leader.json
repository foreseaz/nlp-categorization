Do you get lost in your own words while speaking?  </p>  <p>  \tAt some point, all of us have wondered: How do some people grab the attention of millions with such ease? What’s the secret?  </p>  <p>  \tWell, the biggest secret is that…there are no secrets. These are all skills that are developed over time.  </p>  <p>  \tThis course is an accumulation of my notes from over 30 years of experience presenting across the world.  </p>  <p>  \tWhen you boil down every memorable speech and every great public speaker in history, you will arrive at the foundation of what makes a great public speaking performance.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>The 5 Pillars of Public Speaking:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><strong>Strong argument</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Clear benefit</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Powerful delivery</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Attractive presentation</strong></li>  \t<li><strong>Energetic ending</strong></li>  </ul>  <p>  \tThe good news is that you don’t have to be born as a Steve Jobs, Tony Robbins or Oprah Winfrey to do it. It’s not a gift – it’s a skill. In this course you will not only discover what these 5 pillars mean, but you will also learn how to apply them in YOUR life and presentations.  </p>  <p>  \tThese 5 pillars are the foundation of a professional’s <strong>confidence</strong> in front of an audience. After you complete this course, YOU will be able to present with confidence next time you’re in the spotlight.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>You will learn:</strong>  </p>  <ul>  \t<li><span>How to make a </span><strong>strong argument</strong><span> that will convince your audience.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to provide a </span><strong>clear benefit</strong><span> that will grab their attention from the start.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to give a </span><strong>powerful delivery</strong><span> that will inspire your audience.</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to make an </span><strong>attractive presentation</strong><span> – it doesn&#039;t have to be complicated!</span></li>  \t<li><span>How to conclude a presentation with an </span><strong>energetic ending</strong><span>.
