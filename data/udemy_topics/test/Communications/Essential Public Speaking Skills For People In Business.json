    "description": "<p style=\"\">I have been a public speaker for most of my life both in the world of business, corporate entertainment and motivational speaking. I am naturally shy and introspective, but have been able to develop highly effective strategies that have worked for me time and time again in large arenas and auditoriums in front of hundreds of people, and in small group settings. The ability to be a public speaker is absolutely essential for anyone in business. As a business owner, if you want to motivate your staff, promote your goods and services to key decision makers, and enhance the kudos of your company, then public speaking skills are crucial. This course covers the principles of public speaking from a business perspective and includes PDF files and exercises for staff training or personal development. Once applied, the principles I teach will take your self confidence to another level. And more than that, they will take your business to the next level too. There are 7 lectures and each lecture comes with the presentations in PDF file format. </p>",
