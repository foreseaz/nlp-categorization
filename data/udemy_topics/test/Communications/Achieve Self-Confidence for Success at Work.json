    "description": "<p><em>Achieve Self-Confidence for Success at Work</em> is the perfect\ncourse for you if you’re having trouble getting ahead at work or feel you’re\nwalked all over.  In this course, I teach\nyou the difference between low and high self-confidence and how to transform\nyour thoughts and the pictures in your mind so you feel self-confident from the inside.  You’ll learn how to identify the right type of job for your personality, do a bang-up job at work,\nand how to speak up in meetings.  And more than that, you’ll gain the skills to\nconfidently ask for a raise and feel self-assured when giving a presentation.   Some people suffer from being\nperfectionists where they do their best to do everything just right and not\nmake a single mistake.  You’ll understand\nthe difference between being a perfectionist and a healthier high achiever and\nhow to modify your behavior to make the change. \nDo you have a habit of saying yes when a co-worker asks you to do extra\nwork or passively allow others to\ncriticize you with no cause?  If so, you’re\na passive personality, and your co-workers are taking advantage of you.  You’ll learn the four types of “I” statements\nthat assertive people commonly use to express their opinions as well as their\nwants and needs.  You’ll also gain the\nknowledge of improving your relationships with your co-workers on personal\nand professional levels and dealing with a difficult boss.  </p>",
