I have a poker game to get to tonight, and so I really want to get this done in a few minutes instead of a few hours.</p>  <p>And that is really what this course is all about. How can you shorten the amount of time it takes you to write, while at the same time maintaining or improving the quality?</p><p>How can you avoid staring at the page, or worse, just procrastinating all the writing you need to do?</p><p>I was inspired to write this course when watching a friend of mine composing emails. He was just staring at the screen thinking of what to write and how to say it...</p><p>I swear, certain species of birds went through new evolutionary phases between when he started that email and when he actually sent it.</p><p>I tend to be the opposite. I'll respond to the most important of emails in a couple of minutes without second guessing my writing.</p><p>Similarly, I often sit down to write a book and will end up with 2000-3000 words in just an hour or so.</p><p>In this course I'm going to share with you 10 ways you too can be a more productive, confident, and creative writer. </p><p>Personally, I’ve used the same techniques I teach inside to publish 12 books and create 7 Udemy courses in less than 3 years. </p><p>So join me inside and start planning what you're going to do with all the extra time you'll have once you become a fast and efficient wordsmith. </p><p>Your Writing Pro,</p><p>Dan Johnston</p>  <p>  \t  <strong>P.S. </strong>Write Now! is constantly being updated and upgraded.
