    "description": "<p>In a world where digital information is a must and where social capital is key to creating meaningful and lasting relationships, businesses rely on employees to carry the brand, as the ‘rank and file’ workforce has more credibility than corporate executives in today’s environment. With this discovery, organisations must focus efforts on cultivating their employee brand advocates while balancing authentic communication.</p>\n\n<ul><li>We will look at how an ongoing digital revolution is sweeping through businesses all over the globe, bringing new capabilities and efficiencies to the workplace but also creating unique challenges. </li><li>We explore how the organisation needs to adopt a new attitude to brand risk, to become less hierarchical and to embrace new methods of working.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The company-employee relationship matures over time, and it is unrealistic to expect an employee to immediately fall head-over-heels in love with any brand. Staff will not represent a company that they do not understand or do not feel valued by, and the company must work to fully engage employees in all areas of the company before turning them into individuals who can successfully market the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes employee brand advocates stand apart is there enthusiastic communication </strong>about these experiences, leveraging influence and new collaborative networks. Total employee engagement should be at the center of your company culture ideals, and advancing your brand image, productivity and profitability cannot be done without the commitment and passion of your employee brand advocates.</p>",
