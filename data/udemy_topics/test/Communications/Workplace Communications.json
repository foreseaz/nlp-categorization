    "description": "<p>This is a short course that uses years of business coaching experience to highlight some typical communication problems in the workplace. We use a quality video made with professional actors to tell the story of Jack the dentist. We then use this story as a case study to highlight a few key lessons. We discuss; the communication process and how effective leaders communicate, learning styles and why they are relevant to effective communication, the principle of specificity and why vague communication is so dangerous, and the power of being present. This course is meant for busy managers and business owners and is deliberately kept short, but hopefully with some very powerful lessons that you will remember for a long time.</p>",
