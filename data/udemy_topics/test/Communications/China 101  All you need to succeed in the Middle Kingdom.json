Whether you live in or outside of China, it is very likely that you will have (or already have) Chinese suppliers, distributors or investors. Understanding their way of thinking and being familiar with their customs and habits will help you a lot to succeed in any project related to China that you might be involved in.  </p>  <p>  \t            I moved to China in 2008, with no prior knowledge about the country, its language or its people. Four years later, based on the solid network of relations (guanxi) that I had managed to build, I started my own company and became one of the few foreign entrepreneurs able to succeed in China. Now I’ve put together all the things that I’ve learned and created this course to share this knowledge let others benefit from my experience. I’ve tried to include as many examples as possible and all are based on real life situations that I came across.  </p>  <p>  \t<strong>Altogether I’m sure you’ll find this information useful and that it will help you optimize your chances of success in China!</strong>  </p>",
