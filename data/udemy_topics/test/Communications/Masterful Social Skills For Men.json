    "description": "<p style=\"\">&nbsp;<span style=\"\">Masterful Social Skills For Men</span> is a confidence-boosting, life enhancing experience for guys who feel like they may have gathered some rust on their socializing skills - especially around women - or who would simply enjoy having a structured &quot;meeting plan&quot; ready and available in their heads to execute at a moment&#039;s notice whenever they encounter an attractive woman somewhere.&nbsp; This would consist of a customized routine (but NOT a robotic one) that you can switch into instantly whenever you may need it in order to give yourself something cool, clever and <span style=\"\">purposeful </span>to say to any women who catches your eye.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">The program includes actual <span style=\"\">dialogs </span>that you can use to force critical turns in any ordinary conversation - giving you the freedom to escalate things romantically whenever you might choose to do so.&nbsp; These pointed &quot;things to say&quot; can be fully customized to suit your own personal style and personality, based on a simple formula that you will use to structure unique conversational dialogs for yourself.&nbsp; No canned &quot;pick up lines&quot; allowed!<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">The program consists of 17 video lectures arranged in 5 sections, plus it includes 5 complete audio soundtracks in MP3 format and 4 short PDF summary guides for download.&nbsp; The 17 lectures together total 2 hours of instruction.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">I&#039;ve corresponded informally with hundreds of men over the past 11 years since I released my first book on this subject of social shyness and rejection fear, and I&#039;ve come to understand the sorts of common and repeated problems that they have endured through the stories they&#039;ve shared with me.&nbsp; There&#039;s a lot of pain as you might expect, but behind it all I&#039;ve discovered several universal factors that I believe contribute heavily to a guy&#039;s social recalcitrance, or even outright awkwardness.&nbsp; Many of these issues stem from a specific sort of <span style=\"\">shame </span>which can get lodged in your unconscious mind at some unsuspecting point in your life, where it then modifies your situational behaviors in ways that it mistakenly believes will <span style=\"\">protect </span>it.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">In all, this program should be a fascinating exercise in self-investigation, possibly a life-altering one.</p><p style=\"\">My workarounds for shyness and fear of rejection are woven throughout what I call the &quot;Pull Tabbing&quot; process - which you will learn is a <span style=\"\">practiced routine</span> for casually (and discreetly) sampling the personalities of all the various women who may interest you.&nbsp; That would be everywhere and anywhere that you happen to run across them: at work, in the gym, the mall, the classroom, at social gatherings, etc.<br style=\"\"><br style=\"\">You&#039;ll learn how to identify and come to grips with the internal issues that have been driving your fear and social nervousness, as well as creating all the romantic excitement for yourself that you can possibly handle in the process.<br style=\"\"></p>",
