    "description": "<p>Learn a 12-step, repeatable process to write a nonfiction book quickly and well. No more procrastinating, dealing with interruptions, staring at the screen blankly wondering where to start, trying to pull together disjointed sections and ideas as you attempt to plan, organize, draft, and edit your book.</p><p><strong>Master the Manuscript Writing Process from A-Z</strong><br></p><p>Adopt writing routines and habits that make you more productive</p><p>Learn the best time to do background versus \"fact\" research</p><p>Outline your information and ideas in hours rather than days using idea wheels</p><p>Identify 5 \"quick edits\" and which to do when</p><p>Use a checklist to polish your prose and rid your writing of the most common weaknesses</p><p><strong>Make Quality and Productivity Your Mantra</strong></p><p>Many people who would like to make a living as a writer feel that they cannot do so because they hear sad stories of people who've worked on a single book for months or often for a couple of years. So naturally, their \"hourly rate\" makes a living wage impossible unless they sell millions of copies. Many good writers struggle not so much with their book's content, but with the time it takes them to finish a book. </p><p>But what if that same book could be written in 2-3 weeks? The payoff sounds much better. That's exactly the point of this course. To reduce the writing time, reduce the frustration, and increase the payoff!</p><p>You will no longer approach each new book as if it were a completely new project. Instead, you'll be able to tackle the book writing just as simply as you fill out a form, Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, and so forth.</p><p>And if you have the desire to write a book in your area of expertise, but don't exactly know how to shape that experience, you'll also learn 12 ways to shape that expertise into a publishable book concept.</p><p>You'll also have a short opportunity to test your actual writing skills briefly. And if you decide you may need help in the form of a freelance editor, collaborator, or ghostwriter, you'll discover the different roles these people play and what to expect from each.</p><p>The course has 8 video-recorded lectures--from 5 - 19 minutes each in length. </p><p><br></p>",
