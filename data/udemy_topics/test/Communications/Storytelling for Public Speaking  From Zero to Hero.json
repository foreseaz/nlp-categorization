    "description": "<p>Our audiences are running sick and tired of speakers that bring no emotion to the stage, that bore them to death or that use cheap tactics such as \"Raise your hand if...\". People want to see authenticity, they want an emotional experience and to listen to something trully unique and remarkable. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to deliver this to the audiences you speak and trully stand out as a speaker, I invite you to join this course. Like any hero, you will embark on a learning process from which you will emerge as a great storyteller. Yet, it will require your full dedication to follow every creative exercise and to dive into the process.</p>\n\n<p>In this course I will share with you the stories and concepts that have helped me in my career as a public speaker and which have utimately lead to me to speak at TEDx University of Piraeus and TEDx Bacău in 2015. </p>",
