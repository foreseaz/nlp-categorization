Have you attended a <strong>public speaking</strong> school yet still have problems with public speaking? Do you need to be persuasive in your <strong>presentations</strong>? And you've watched video courses that include everything from fonts choices to fashion tips, but they haven't taught you <strong>anything practical </strong>to help you sell your ideas, products or services?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>My experience was the same. I've watched actors, and \nthe only thing I learned was\nhow to clear my vocal cords before speaking. Sales people were too aggressive\nfor my style. And they were boring too, so why would I copy them? And those computer\nexperts? Well, they usually don't have the <em>experience</em> of the mentioned\nprofessionals.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That's why I recorded \nmy practical tips for your\npublic speaking from my 21 years of giving presentations. They may not bring\nyou a $17,000 business award like they brought me, but they might - because by\nwatching these compact lectures you'll have the same potentially winning background\nthat I had. How did I do it? With the help of the <strong>SALT Framework</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SALT Framework stands for:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Statement</li><li>Appearance</li><li>Logic</li><li>Tips</li></ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>SALT includes practical knowledge \nabout how to present\na <strong>statement</strong> that will be long remembered by your audience. It\nexplains how to enhance your presentation <strong>appearance</strong> to be\nmost persuasive. It also has <strong>logical</strong> steps before, during and\nafter your speaking. And finally SALT includes videos of <strong>additional tips</strong> gained\nfrom actual experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So why don't you stop looking for that black pepper to spice up your presentations when what you really need to master is using salt first? \nJust imagine that <em>feeling </em>when\nyou start speaking in front of your family, friends or business audiences - and\nyou don't even need to think about how to use your hands, how to appear relaxed\nor achieve your goal because it all happens automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Take this course by clicking a button and start using <strong>practical public speaking tips today</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Matt S Rinc,<br>public speaking trainer</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>P.S.
