    "description": "<p><strong>Share What You Know</strong></p>\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur or professional, sharing your writing is at the heart of building credibility and growing your business. There is no shortage of <em>where </em>to do this but, if you want your writing to stand out, you need to know <em>what</em> <em>makes good writing</em>, and know <em>how </em><em>to do it </em>in a way that is simple, and repeatable, so that you can write effortlessly time after time.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don't consider yourself a 'writer', this class gives you a fill-in-the-blanks structure to craft a piece of 'how-to' writing that will hook your ideal reader <em>no matter who they are</em>. Creating work that engages and connects with the people you want to reach is what makes the writing good; this is not a class about grammar and language. Follow this simple framework first, and then adapt and innovate as you find your own voice. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn by Doing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course is different to other courses you might take because it's based on <em>doing</em> rather than <em>listening</em>. You get a project to complete and, after each video lesson, I ask you to spend a few minutes implementing what we just covered. Each activity builds on itself in sections one and two so that you end up with a complete article, or the chapter of a book. You then refine and polish your piece in section three, practising skills that will serve you for life, crafting writing that makes you (and your business) stand out. The process is deceptively simple because I want you to complete a piece of writing, and feel confident with your new skills. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teach and Inspire</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your topic, this course breaks down the fundamentals of 'how-to' writing with a structure you can use again and again to teach your reader something new, to inspire them to do something new or to think differently about your topic. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'm excited that you're here and can't wait to see your work inside the class!</p>",
