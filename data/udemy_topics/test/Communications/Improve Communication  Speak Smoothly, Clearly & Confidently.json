    "description": "<p style=\"\">  \t    How to Improve Communication Skills  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    Do you struggle with getting your words out when explaining things in important situations, situations like interviews, presentations, meetings, phone or video conferences?  Do you become anxious, nervous tense up, loose track of where you&#039;re at, speak too fast, or even stutter?  Do people sometimes have trouble understanding you because English is your second language?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you answered yes to any of the above, relax…help is finally here!  My name is Michael Williams and I stuttered for over 20 years.  For the past two decades I&#039;ve made my living speaking.  I teach academic success as a professor, have conducted day-long and multi-day relationship and communication retreats, taught in churches, spoke on live T.V., radio and much more.  I&#039;ve even taught small classes in Spanish.  I now work with people from all around the world helping them learn to speak more smoothly, fluently, clearly and confidently.  I call this type of speech &quot;Proactive.&quot;  Eventually, I created a step-by-step process for becoming a Proactive Speaker and I call this the PR90D Speech System.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you struggle with speaking well, this course can literally transform your life.  You probably know from personal experience that not being able to speak well can limit your career choices, restrict your social life, and restrict your relationships.  I&#039;ve worked with people who could not get jobs, or who were being paid up to 30% less because of their speech.  These were brilliantly intelligent people, but because of speech limitations, they were not able to express themselves the way they wanted.  <br style=\"\">  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    In this course, I&#039;m going to share with you one of the master techniques from my PRO90D Speech System  that can help you…  </p>  <ol style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Speak more smoothly so that both you and those to whom you are speaking feel relaxed, tuned in and focused. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Speak more fluently so that your thoughts and words stream together in sync helping you present your thoughts and ideas in an intelligent and precise manner.  <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Speak more clearly so that your listeners can understand exactly what you&#039;re saying and what you mean.  <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Speak more confidently so that your listeners like and trust you, and therefore believe what you are saying.  <br style=\"\">  \t</li>  </ol>  <p style=\"\">  \t    As a result of putting into practice what you learn from this course, you will be able to:  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li style=\"\">Clear interviews knowing that you have put forth your best self. <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Express your opinions, ideas, and thoughts easily and well in meetings and in social events.  <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Answer questions with grace and precision, projecting a sense of calm and confidence even if you don&#039;t know all the answers.  <br style=\"\">  \t<br style=\"\">  \t</li>  \t<li style=\"\">Make interactive, engaging and transforming presentations.  <br style=\"\">  \t</li>  </ul>  <p style=\"\">  \t    If you&#039;re willing to put in the time and work, the information in this course will transform your life.  If you&#039;re not, do not waste your time taking it.  While the information may be great, it will do you no good if you don&#039;t practice using it.  Also, be willing to take however, long it takes to get the results you want.  This is not a quick fix.  Certainly, you may see amazingly fast results, but don&#039;t be disappointed and give it if this doesn&#039;t happen.  Expect that this will take longer than you expect and be more difficult that you anticipate.  The time will pass anyway, so the only question is, will you be doing something to make positive changes while the time is passing?  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    This course contains over 16 transformative sessions (over 3 hours of instruction).  Michael will demonstrate exactly what you need to do to accomplish the goals laid out in this course.  If you follow his instructions, you will see results.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \t    NOTE: This course does NOT have a written transcript.  </p>",
