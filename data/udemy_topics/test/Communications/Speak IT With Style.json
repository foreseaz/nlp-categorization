    "description": "<p>Let’s say you work in a technical field and you need to give a presentation. If you’re speaking on a subject like enterprise architecture, or data management, or cyber security, for example, you’ll often be talking with people who are not experts in your particular area.</p><p>They might be customers, or a general audience at a conference, or executives and decision-makers you’d like to influence.</p><p>When you’re in this situation, it’s challenging to do it in a way that’s engaging and accessible. Too often, presentations on technical subjects are dry, boring, and frustrating for the audience. </p><p>The people who are able to do it differently, though, the people who speak IT with style, have a huge advantage. These people are not only great in their technical area, they’re also able to connect with other people and show them the value in their ideas.</p><p>These are the people whose projects are funded, whose ideas fly, who get to work on the coolest stuff, and who get great jobs at great workplaces. These are the people who get to make a difference.</p><p>Everyone can learn to do this.  And that’s what we’ll do in this course.  We’re going to throw away the old story that it’s OK for technical presentations to be dry and boring. We’re aiming higher.  We’re also throwing away the old story that you’re not a good speaker. You absolutely can be. </p><p>We’ll build your presentation together from start to finish, with videos and exercises to help you every step of the way.</p><p>When you’ve finished the course you’ll have a presentation that’s ready to go, one that will have a real impact on your audience, no matter who that audience is and no matter what topic you’re speaking on. You’ll amaze yourself at how great you’ll feel delivering this presentation and at how people respond to it. And best of all, you’ll have a process that works, that you can use over and over again for any speaking situation.</p><p>Are you ready to get started?</p>",
