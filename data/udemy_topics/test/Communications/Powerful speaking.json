    "description": "<p>  \t    Have you ever had the experience that people won't listen to you? Would you like to be one of those people for whom people instinctively fall quiet and really listen, whose words carry real weight and impact? With this course, you can and will be like that!  </p>  <p>  \t    Making ourselves heard is a challenge simply because most of us have never been trained to speak effectively.  </p>  <p>  \t          Powerful Speaking is an invaluable set of skills. The human voice is the most powerful sound on this planet; it can make us laugh, cry, inspire us and even change the world. Whether you're teaching your child, closing a prospective client, asking for a raise from your boss or proposing marriage to your partner, what you say and the way you say it will determine the outcome.  </p>  <p>  \t    Many factors contribute to how effectively you speak. We'll reveal all the secrets of content and delivery in this course – everything from vocabulary to intonation – in order to transform your power so that you will speak confidently, naturally and with conviction. The course concludes with my complete masterclass in public speaking, into which I have distilled all of the lessons, tricks and experiences I've learned as an international keynote and four-time TED speaker. In fact, my TED talk on powerful speaking has over 5 million views on TED's website alone, putting it in the top 50 TED talks of all time.  </p>  <p>  \t    So join me on this Powerful Speaking course, which will give weight and authority to your words and leave you speaking so that people listen.  </p>",
