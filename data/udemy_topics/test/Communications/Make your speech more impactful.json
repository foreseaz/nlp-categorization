In this course, Wang talks about the ten things that all speakers need to consider before their next speech, whether it is a presentation in front of clients or a motivational speech for little kids before their soccer final. </p><p>This course is predominantly delivered through video with a number of handy checklists that can help everyone do a quick review of their speech to understand whether it is making the impact it deserves. All in all, the course is about an hour long and each lecture is broken down into an explanation and an example, with a checklist that you can download for future use. </p><p>Have you ever marvelled at a professional speaker and wondered how they do it?
