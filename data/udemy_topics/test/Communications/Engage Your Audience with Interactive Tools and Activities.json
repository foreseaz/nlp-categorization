This course pulls all of that together for you. Together we will move through each stage of a typical seminar, from the time the audience enters the room to the end when you are asking for feedback. At each stage you will be provided with ways to enhance the seminar experience for your audience. Whether you like low-tech or high tech, and whether you are speaking to a small group or a large audience, you will find useful strategies to choose from in the wide variety of activities included in the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other resources in the course include discussion questions, online links and review quizzes.</p>",
