What really struck me about your class was your flawless embodiment of what you were teaching. When you talked to us about body positioning during a presentation, you had been doing exactly that the entire 2 hours you talked with us. Too often in classes/discussions like this, the instructor is simply telling you what you ‘should” do whether or not the presenter himself actually does it. You provided the info, you clearly implemented that information in your own presentations, and its effectiveness showed in the way you presented the class itself. There are very few classes I leave feeling that pumped up about what I do!\"</p><p> Kyle McAllister, Epic Implementation Services</p>",
