    "description": "<p>Case studies are a powerful tool in any marketing strategy. They tell the story of what you do to help others or how your product improves lives. A good case study demonstrates the value and benefit you bring to your customers in an engaging way, rather than simply relating a set of dull facts and figures.</p>\n\n<p>Told well, a case study helps potential customers imagine your product or service in action. They can see themselves benefiting from using your company, and will be inspired to buy from you as a result.</p>\n\n<p>But too many case studies – or ‘stories’ as I prefer to call them – are uninspiring. They are too long, too short, or don’t tell us anything of real value. Sometimes, they are full of jargon and management speak <em>(think phrases like ‘innovative solutions’, ‘blue-sky thinking’ or ‘leverage’)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is usually because the people who write them are too busy concentrating on their own jobs to worry about learning how to craft a story. Does this sound like you?</p>\n\n<p>The good news is you can learn how to write a compelling case study in a relatively short time. Like anything, it takes a lot of practice to become really good. But with a little effort and training you can write something that is ten times better than 90% of case studies out there on the Internet. And that will definitely help you win more business, so it’s a worthwhile investment.</p><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong><br></p>\n\n<p>This course takes you through the process of creating a really good case study. I’ll give you tips on everything from how to write an amazing opening, to making sure you get good testimonials to include when writing about results.</p>\n\n<p>I believe very much in learning by doing, so this course is designed to be practical. At each stage of the writing process, I’ll be asking you to reflect on what you have learned and put it into practice.</p>\n\n<p>By the end, you’ll have a case study that is ready for you to put online and start wowing your customers!</p>",
