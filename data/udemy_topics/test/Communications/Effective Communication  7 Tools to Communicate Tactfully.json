What will begin to happen is...  </p>  <ul style=\"\">  \t<li>People will begin to respond differently to you.  </li>  \t<li>They will receive and respect your opinion more easily.  </li>  \t<li>They will be more willing to listen and agree with you. </li>  </ul>  <p>  \t         Why?

And, finally, this course will challenge you to not just use these tools, but actually make them a part of who you are and how you naturally communicate.  </p>  <p>  \t         If you struggle with communicating diplomatically or tactfully at home or work...Take This Course!
