Nothing gives away an amateur writer more than writing that lacks the discipline that a good grasp of punctuation immediately conveys. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You may already have taken my <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer</strong> course and discovered heaps of tactics to fast-track your writing ability.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But do you yet know the basics of how to use <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">commas</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">colons</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">semi-colons</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">hyphens</strong>, <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">apostrophes</strong> and <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">dashes</strong> properly and effectively? And how to do so with style?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If not, trust me, you'll never be able to weave magic with your words.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>This course probably isn't for you if you already feel very confident in your use of punctuation, as it goes over the fundamentals—along with some crackling insights that only an editor for major news organizations could provide. The course is also not for \"purists\" who may wish to learn everything strictly according to ancient technical grammar rules. </em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>But if you basically spend ages wondering whether a comma should go here or there, and then doubt yourself straight afterwards...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Or frequently end up with a random mess of commas and semi-colons littering your page and distracting from your message...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Or have just forgotten the basics and need a refresher...</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Then this should put you on a firmer footing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It will give you the confidence to use punctuation in a way that's acceptable to many good newspapers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You see, I teach top journalists how to improve their writing and have written and edited for some of the world's biggest news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Financial Times and Bloomberg News.<br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In this course I reveal to you how to use punctuation in a clean and stylish way, so that it doesn't get in the way but rather enhances your writing.</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The best professional writers don't treat punctuation as a set of rigid rules to blindly follow.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As with grammar, they use it as a tool for making their communication more clear and elegant. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, they use punctuation <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">strategically </strong>to enhance the power and beauty of their thoughts.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'm going to teach you how to do the same thing by revealing the diverse uses of each type of punctuation one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll see first-hand how each symbol can be used to create a specific impact on your writing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And I'll aim to teach you without all the usual jargon that surrounds most courses on the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><u>I've studied how the best editors use punctuation strategically to make their articles sing. The truth is, it's really quite easy.</u><br></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Your college tutors may have taught you punctuation in a highly technical, jargon-laden way that left you bored or mystified.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You may dread going back to the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I'm going to steer clear of all that. In fact, by the end of the course you may well wonder why nobody told you that punctuation could be so <em><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">interesting</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>I've designed this course to help get you the understanding as quickly as possible so you can apply your knowledge straight away, without hesitation.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I explain punctuation in a way that anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the English language can understand. There'll be plenty of exercises, too, so you'll feel confident using punctuation forever after.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>What could that do for your career or business?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">By the end of the course, you'll hopefully see commas, dashes, semi-colons and other types of punctuation in a new light. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll discover that a <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">comma </strong>doesn't just help create useful pauses in a sentence, but that it can be a mighty weapon letting you express your ideas with clarity and grace.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You'll discover that <strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">colons </strong>don't only give you a neat way of introducing lists; they can be used to heighten drama and anticipation in your writing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"redactor-inline-converted\">In fact, you'll come to see that each little symbol that you thought was so mundane has its own unique power to create special effects throughout your writing.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This course will also prevent the bad use of punctuation that may be killing the authority of your writing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After all, how seriously would any boss take a cover letter that lacks a basic knowledge of punctuation?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And how much more seriously would the letter be taken if your punctuation enabled you to express your background, skills and qualities with style and flair?  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>How much better would your college essays, articles, blogs and books look? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>You're one step away from discovering these methods, which will change your writing forever. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>",
