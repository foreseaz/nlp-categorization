Over the next couple of generations, our children and their children--who have  been raised on mass media rather than family stories and values sharing of  important people in their lives--may come to know very little about their  ancestry and traditions.</p>    <p style=\"\">You live as long as your  story is remembered.</p>    <p style=\"\">This is a very intensive  weekend project that will produce the bones of memoir writing or  life story.&nbsp; There is a longer, more in-depth course on how  to write a memoir in the works, but this will give you a great start and you may  be satisfied with the finished product come Monday.</p>&lt;/p&gt;  ",
