Well, this course will help anyone freshen up on their grammar and punctuation, but also teach others how to professionally edit their own work. This is beneficial for all people in any business. During this course, you will learn about different grammar rules (i.e. nouns, verbs, subject-verb agreements), punctuation rules (apostrophes, commas, semi-colons), and editing and proofreading rules. This multimodal course will help you understand the different rules and learn how to point them out in any type of text that needs to be edited. In this course, you will first learn about grammar rules, then punctation rules, and then how to properly edit and proofread a text, which will take approximately two weeks to finish. </p>",
