Our company’s goal is to reach out to people of all ages and walks of life and help them to become better and more effective speakers. We understand the importance of being a skilled speaker, and wish to pass on our knowledge to you!</p><p><strong>The ISDA Motto</strong>:</p><p><strong><em>Practical Skills for Practical People</em></strong><br></p><p><strong>Communication is Key to Success!</strong></p><p>In our program, we take a microscope to the science and psychology of public speaking and break it down for you so you can learn how to be a successful public speaker from the ground up! We feel that while most programs will teach you basic surface level ways to become better at speaking, we want to help you understand the science behind communication and show you how you can shape your world by simply using your voice.</p><p><strong>Application is Important!</strong></p><p>Part of the process of becoming a better speaker, is to actually apply the knowledge gained. If you just sit through all of the lessons and don’t apply any of the information, it’s likely you will not be benefited. The best way to learn is by doing, so it is important that while enrolled in this course you apply the knowledge gained to your everyday life. There will be something we call “Awareness Exercises” which will be suggested assignments that are fun and easy ways to apply the knowledge you have gained through our course.</p><p><strong>FREE Live Practice Session!</strong></p><p><span>Upon\n completion of the course and 30 days after purchase, message us to \nschedule a free group practice session.
