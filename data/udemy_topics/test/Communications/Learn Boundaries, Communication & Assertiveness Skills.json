This creates unhealthy boundaries in the children and makes it exceedingly difficult to set healthy boundaries and stop abuse.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe first section of this course teaches what healthy and unhealthy boundaries are, how they develop, how shame warps them and impairs an individualâ€™s ability to defend against abusive behavior of self and others.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tWe are able to become intimate and resolve problems to the degree that we are able to communicate effectively. Most of the problems associated with society can be traced to faulty communication and conflict resolution. This video addresses the art of communication.  </p>  <p style=\"\">  \tThe second section teaches effective communication and assertiveness principles and identifies aggressive and passive-aggressive patterns. It will help you identify emotions and teach paraphrasing and validating.  </p>",
